182428,L216169,u5296,m351,BREWER,"... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ."
182429,L216168,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Ninety.
182430,L216167,u5296,m351,BREWER,... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
182431,L216166,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Start over.
182432,L216165,u5296,m351,BREWER,Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
182433,L216164,u5302,m351,RAMBO,You stopped.
182434,L216163,u5296,m351,BREWER,Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
182435,L216162,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Again.
182436,L216132,u5302,m351,RAMBO,No.
182437,L216131,u5296,m351,BREWER,Ever do this from a jet?
182438,L216116,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Clown?  Now back up there, buddy..."
182439,L216115,u5302,m351,RAMBO,This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
182440,L216566,u5297,m351,CO,It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
182441,L216565,u5302,m351,RAMBO,John.  My name is John.
182442,L216562,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
182443,L216561,u5297,m351,CO,What was that?
182444,L216557,u5297,m351,CO,"Why you don't feel love?  Not allowed?  Dead inside, maybe?  You make yourself dead already so they can't kill you?  In-vulnerabo?  Bullshit!"
182445,L216556,u5302,m351,RAMBO,"Look, Co..."
182446,L216551,u5302,m351,RAMBO,How?
182447,L216550,u5297,m351,CO,Yes you can.
182448,L216549,u5302,m351,RAMBO,I couldn't get you in.
182449,L216548,u5297,m351,CO,I know.  I go with you.
182450,L216547,u5302,m351,RAMBO,How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
182451,L216546,u5297,m351,CO,"Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch ""Dynasty."""
182452,L216545,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
182453,L216544,u5297,m351,CO,You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
182454,L216541,u5297,m351,CO,In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
182455,L216540,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Invulnerable.
182456,L216539,u5297,m351,CO,You think you are... .
182457,L216538,u5302,m351,RAMBO,I do?
182458,L216537,u5297,m351,CO,"Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me."
182459,L216536,u5302,m351,RAMBO,And how'd you sneak up like that?
182460,L216535,u5297,m351,CO,"Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here."
182461,L216534,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Christ.  How'd you get here?
182462,L216397,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Let's go.
182463,L216396,u5297,m351,CO,Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
182464,L216395,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Thanks.
182465,L216392,u5297,m351,CO,They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
182466,L216391,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Why'd they want us?
182467,L216390,u5297,m351,CO,Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
182468,L216389,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Are you okay?
182469,L216317,u5297,m351,CO,Nguyen is good boy.
182470,L216316,u5302,m351,RAMBO,It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
182471,L216315,u5297,m351,CO,"Huntington Beach, California."
182472,L216314,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
182473,L216312,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Where's his father?
182474,L216311,u5297,m351,CO,Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
182475,L216307,u5297,m351,CO,Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
182476,L216306,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Intelligence work.
182477,L216305,u5297,m351,CO,Spooks?
182478,L216304,u5302,m351,RAMBO,How did you get started working for the spooks?
182479,L216279,u5297,m351,CO,Crazy motherfucker.
182480,L216278,u5302,m351,RAMBO,I thought he was with you.
182481,L216277,u5297,m351,CO,Where did you find this clown?
182482,L216270,u5297,m351,CO,I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
182483,L216269,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Why's that?
182484,L216268,u5297,m351,CO,I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
182485,L216267,u5302,m351,RAMBO,How do we get upriver?
182486,L216264,u5297,m351,CO,Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
182487,L216263,u5302,m351,RAMBO,You really got a Masters Degree?
182488,L216257,u5297,m351,CO,"It means ""virgin.""  My mother was comedian."
182489,L216256,u5302,m351,RAMBO,I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
182490,L216436,u5299,m351,DOYLE,"Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now."
182491,L216435,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,You pathetic scum.
182492,L216432,u5299,m351,DOYLE,"Sorry, Sir."
182493,L216431,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,That's an order.
182494,L216430,u5299,m351,DOYLE,"Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it."
182495,L216429,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"Stay on your heading, Captain."
182496,L216369,u5299,m351,DOYLE,Let's get that tent down!
182497,L216368,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says ""May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."""
182498,L216129,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,That's right.
182499,L216128,u5302,m351,RAMBO,All this is for us?
182500,L216121,u5302,m351,RAMBO,I was crossed-trained in gunships.
182501,L216120,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,"I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo."
182502,L216092,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you.
182503,L216091,u5302,m351,RAMBO,We just take pictures?
182504,L216090,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
182505,L216089,u5302,m351,RAMBO,We don't try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
182506,L216088,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,"This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy."
182507,L216087,u5302,m351,RAMBO,What's the plan?
182508,L216086,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
182509,L216070,u5302,m351,RAMBO,I'm not jumping blind.
182510,L216069,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Not yet.
182511,L216068,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Where?
182512,L216067,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
182513,L216066,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Why me?
182514,L216065,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
182515,L216064,u5302,m351,RAMBO,What's the job?
182516,L216063,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
182517,L216062,u5302,m351,RAMBO,I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
182518,L216581,u5303,m351,TECH,He... took it.
182519,L216580,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,What?
182520,L216579,u5303,m351,TECH,"... and then he, uh... took the other one."
182521,L216578,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Christ almighty.
182522,L216577,u5303,m351,TECH,"Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships..."
182523,L216532,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,What?
182524,L216531,u5303,m351,TECH,"Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through."
182525,L216530,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Typical...
182526,L216529,u5303,m351,TECH,Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
182527,L216528,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
182528,L216463,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,What that?
182529,L216462,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,It's not over.  You made one mistake.
182530,L216461,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,"You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away."
182531,L216457,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
182532,L216456,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
182533,L216455,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,"That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a ""B"".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way."
182534,L216454,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"""Terminate with extreme prejudice."""
182535,L216453,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,"It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said ""No POWs"" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice."
182536,L216452,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
182537,L216451,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Word came down... they wanted an answer.  And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs.  But it had to look good.  Best effort.  The whole dog-and-pony show.
182538,L216450,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,This mission was a scam from the word go?
182539,L216449,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,"Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty."
182540,L216448,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny."
182541,L216447,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,"You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem."
182542,L216446,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
182543,L216445,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,Not my people.
182544,L216444,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,"Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed."
182545,L216443,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,Take your time.
182546,L216302,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Have fun.
182547,L216301,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,I know...
182548,L216300,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
182549,L216299,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,I know.
182550,L216298,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,It's not necessary.
182551,L216297,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection."
182552,L216296,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,What's up?
182553,L216154,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
182554,L216153,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,Black.  No sugar.
182555,L216152,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
182556,L216151,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,You think they'll find any?
182557,L216150,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
182558,L216149,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,How long before you're fully on line?
182559,L216124,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,Nice work.
182560,L216123,u5300,m351,KIRKHILL,About 22 hours on site.
182561,L216122,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,How long have you been setting up?
182562,L216356,u5301,m351,PRISONER,De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
182563,L216355,u5302,m351,RAMBO,What's your name?
182564,L216354,u5301,m351,PRISONER,I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna be... stiff.
182565,L216353,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Can you walk?
182566,L216352,u5301,m351,PRISONER,"Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!"
182567,L216351,u5302,m351,RAMBO,American.  Come to get you out.
182568,L216350,u5301,m351,PRISONER,Who're you?
182569,L216191,u5302,m351,RAMBO,"You got it, sir."
182570,L216190,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed."
182571,L216189,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Let's do it.
182572,L216118,u5302,m351,RAMBO,I say we tape him to a chair.
182573,L216117,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
182574,L216075,u5302,m351,RAMBO,"This just occurred to somebody, now?"
182575,L216074,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"We left some people behind there, John... POWs."
182576,L216056,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
182577,L216055,u5302,m351,RAMBO,"I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say ""you did good, John."" And mean it.  That's all.  After all that."
182578,L216054,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,What did you want?
182579,L216053,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
182580,L216052,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts."
182581,L216051,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Yeah.  Big time.
182582,L216050,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,Congressional Medal of Honor.
182583,L216049,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,You're not.
182584,L216048,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Those men are all dead.
182585,L216047,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
182586,L216046,u5302,m351,RAMBO,That's it.  My life.
182587,L216045,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,This your stuff?
182588,L216043,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
182589,L216042,u5302,m351,RAMBO,There were treating me like a headcase.
182590,L216041,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand."
182591,L216040,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Am I out of here?
182592,L216039,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?"
182593,L216038,u5302,m351,RAMBO,I could take it or leave it.
182594,L216037,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,I hear you're not enjoying it here.
182595,L216036,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,Mind if I sit down?
182596,L216035,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Colonel.
182597,L216034,u5304,m351,TRAUTMAN,"Hello, John."
182598,L218074,u5305,m352,ANNE,Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
182599,L218073,u5312,m352,LYDIA,No really..I can't.
182600,L218072,u5305,m352,ANNE,"The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat."
182601,L218071,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"Oh, no..I have to get home..."
182602,L218057,u5305,m352,ANNE,Yeah!
182603,L218056,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Really?
182604,L218055,u5305,m352,ANNE,"You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch."
182605,L218054,u5312,m352,LYDIA,I'm paying you.
182606,L218053,u5305,m352,ANNE,That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
182607,L218052,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things."
182608,L218051,u5305,m352,ANNE,I don't understand you. What is the problem?
182609,L218050,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts..."
182610,L218049,u5305,m352,ANNE,"I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times."
182611,L218048,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. ""So, have you met anyone?""...""No mom"".. ""So what's going to happen?""... ""I don't know Mom""... I only thank God I moved out."
182612,L218039,u5305,m352,ANNE,It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
182613,L218038,u5312,m352,LYDIA,I never really...went through a... dating period.
182614,L218037,u5305,m352,ANNE,Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
182615,L218036,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Meeting ... people.
182616,L218035,u5305,m352,ANNE,What?
182617,L218034,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"I mean, it's not easy in this day and age."
182618,L218033,u5305,m352,ANNE,Fine.
182619,L218032,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"Well, there's nobody special!"
182620,L218031,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything..."
182621,L218030,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Do I look like I have someone special?
182622,L218029,u5305,m352,ANNE,...SO...anybody special in your life?
182623,L218028,u5305,m352,ANNE,"It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  ""divorce is the sister-in-law of death""."
182624,L218027,u5312,m352,LYDIA,My parents were divorced.
182625,L218026,u5312,m352,LYDIA,You threw him out?
182626,L218025,u5305,m352,ANNE,"...So he says to me, ""you'll never find another man like me""...I said, ""please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip."
182627,L218024,u5305,m352,ANNE,That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
182628,L218023,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Will it hurt?
182629,L218022,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"No, thank you."
182630,L218021,u5305,m352,ANNE,Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
182631,L218020,u5312,m352,LYDIA,I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
182632,L217986,u5305,m352,ANNE,Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
182633,L217985,u5312,m352,LYDIA,I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
182634,L217983,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"Well, I guess I'll come back then."
182635,L217982,u5305,m352,ANNE,Yes!  They'll be in soon.
182636,L217981,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Well did you or didn't you?
182637,L217980,u5305,m352,ANNE,"You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day."
182638,L217963,u5305,m352,ANNE,Yeah.
182639,L217962,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"But now it's free, right?"
182640,L217961,u5305,m352,ANNE,This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
182641,L218095,u5305,m352,ANNE,Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
182642,L218094,u5313,m352,PARRY,Yep! Right on it!
182643,L218013,u5305,m352,ANNE,"<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!"
182644,L218012,u5313,m352,PARRY,Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
182645,L218009,u5313,m352,PARRY,Why this is outrageous!...
182646,L218008,u5305,m352,ANNE,Most men are.
182647,L218007,u5313,m352,PARRY,I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
182648,L218006,u5305,m352,ANNE,<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
182649,L218002,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Jack, he's starting a conversation..."
182650,L218001,u5313,m352,PARRY,This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
182651,L218000,u5305,m352,ANNE,"I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum."
182652,L217995,u5313,m352,PARRY,Got any more bread crust?
182653,L217994,u5305,m352,ANNE,Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
182654,L218263,u5305,m352,ANNE,Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!

182659,L218191,u5310,m352,JACK,Then what do you want to stay with me for?
182660,L218190,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  ""pain"", your problems... You think you're entertaining?"
182661,L218189,u5310,m352,JACK,"<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!"

182665,L218185,u5310,m352,JACK,I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
182666,L218184,u5305,m352,ANNE,"You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?"
182667,L218181,u5305,m352,ANNE,"No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?"
182668,L218180,u5310,m352,JACK,No.
182669,L218179,u5305,m352,ANNE,"First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?"
182670,L218178,u5310,m352,JACK,"... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't..."
182671,L218175,u5310,m352,JACK,"Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans."
182672,L218174,u5305,m352,ANNE,Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
182673,L218173,u5310,m352,JACK,"... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little."
182674,L218172,u5310,m352,JACK,No... it's just...
182675,L218171,u5305,m352,ANNE,"You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?"
182676,L218170,u5310,m352,JACK,"No, I... I think we should talk about this."
182677,L218169,u5305,m352,ANNE,"""I'm an incredible woman?""  What is this, a death sentence?"

182690,L218154,u5305,m352,ANNE,You're kidding!  What did he say?
182691,L218153,u5310,m352,JACK,My agent.  I called my agent.
182692,L218152,u5305,m352,ANNE,So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
182693,L218112,u5310,m352,JACK,You were great. Thanks alot.
182694,L218111,u5305,m352,ANNE,Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
182695,L218110,u5310,m352,JACK,Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
182696,L218109,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, ""some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores""."
182697,L218108,u5310,m352,JACK,"You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?"
182698,L218103,u5305,m352,ANNE,I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
182699,L218102,u5310,m352,JACK,What do you think?

182704,L217998,u5310,m352,JACK,He just needs some clothes?
182705,L217997,u5305,m352,ANNE,I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.

182709,L217914,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Well, what the hell does that mean?"
182710,L217913,u5310,m352,JACK,"See, I told you!"
182711,L217912,u5305,m352,ANNE,What does that mean?
182712,L217911,u5310,m352,JACK,All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
182713,L217910,u5305,m352,ANNE,Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
182714,L217909,u5310,m352,JACK,I... You're not going to understand this.
182715,L217908,u5305,m352,ANNE,What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
182716,L217907,u5310,m352,JACK,"Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I..."
182717,L217906,u5305,m352,ANNE,And who's Lydia?
182718,L217905,u5310,m352,JACK,He's not a moron.
182719,L217904,u5305,m352,ANNE,The moron?
182720,L217903,u5310,m352,JACK,I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
182721,L217902,u5310,m352,JACK,...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
182722,L217901,u5305,m352,ANNE,... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
182723,L217900,u5310,m352,JACK,What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
182724,L217899,u5305,m352,ANNE,You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
182725,L217898,u5310,m352,JACK,I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
182726,L217897,u5305,m352,ANNE,Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
182727,L217896,u5310,m352,JACK,"Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?"
182728,L217895,u5305,m352,ANNE,Can I have my desk please.
182729,L217717,u5310,m352,JACK,I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
182730,L217716,u5305,m352,ANNE,You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
182731,L217715,u5310,m352,JACK,"I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?"
182732,L217714,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class."
182733,L217713,u5310,m352,JACK,"I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed."
182734,L217708,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know..."
182735,L217707,u5310,m352,JACK,... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
182736,L217706,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married."
182737,L217705,u5310,m352,JACK,You still believe in God?
182738,L217704,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Oh, I used to be such a Catholic."
182739,L217700,u5305,m352,ANNE,Okay.  ... I love you...
182740,L217699,u5310,m352,JACK,I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
182741,L217698,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth."
182742,L217697,u5310,m352,JACK,"I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --"
182743,L217696,u5305,m352,ANNE,... So... where did you sleep last night?
182744,L217695,u5305,m352,ANNE,You're all right... you sure...
182745,L217694,u5310,m352,JACK,"No, I'm fine... really..."
182746,L217693,u5305,m352,ANNE,You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
182747,L217689,u5305,m352,ANNE,<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
182748,L217688,u5310,m352,JACK,Two kids tried to set me on fire.
182749,L217687,u5305,m352,ANNE,<u>What</u>!
182750,L217686,u5310,m352,JACK,I was attacked.
182751,L217685,u5305,m352,ANNE,I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
182752,L217684,u5305,m352,ANNE,I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
182753,L217683,u5310,m352,JACK,I'm sorry.
182754,L217528,u5310,m352,JACK,"Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes."
182755,L217527,u5305,m352,ANNE,"It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think..."
182756,L217523,u5310,m352,JACK,Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
182757,L217522,u5305,m352,ANNE,Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
182758,L217521,u5310,m352,JACK,It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
182759,L217520,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?"
182760,L217518,u5305,m352,ANNE,Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
182761,L217517,u5310,m352,JACK,"Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!"
182762,L217516,u5305,m352,ANNE,"Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods."
182763,L218202,u5306,m352,DOCTOR,"You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry."
182764,L218201,u5310,m352,JACK,What if I was a relative?
182765,L218200,u5306,m352,DOCTOR,"Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.."
182766,L218199,u5310,m352,JACK,But..How could that happen?
182767,L218198,u5306,m352,DOCTOR,"I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell."
182768,L218197,u5310,m352,JACK,"Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?"
182769,L218196,u5306,m352,DOCTOR,"He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ...""catatonic  stupor""...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -..."
182770,L218195,u5310,m352,JACK,Parry?
182771,L217464,u5307,m352,EDWIN,She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!
182772,L217463,u5310,m352,JACK,"She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate..."
182773,L217462,u5307,m352,EDWIN,"No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me."
182774,L217461,u5310,m352,JACK,"Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale..."
182775,L217460,u5307,m352,EDWIN,"I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've..."
182776,L217459,u5310,m352,JACK,"Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?"
182777,L217455,u5307,m352,EDWIN,Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
182778,L217454,u5310,m352,JACK,"Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes."
182779,L217453,u5307,m352,EDWIN,"I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's..."
182780,L217452,u5310,m352,JACK,"So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?"
182781,L217721,u5308,m352,FRANK,He's not here.
182782,L217720,u5310,m352,JACK,I'm... just looking for Parry...
182783,L217719,u5308,m352,FRANK,Can I help you?
182784,L217675,u5308,m352,FRANK,He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.
182785,L217674,u5310,m352,JACK,Tragedy?
182786,L217673,u5308,m352,FRANK,"Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?"
182787,L217672,u5310,m352,JACK,No...  He is supposed to live there?
182788,L217671,u5308,m352,FRANK,You a friend of Parry's?
182789,L217664,u5308,m352,FRANK,<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
182790,L217663,u5310,m352,JACK,Uh... basement I think...
182791,L217662,u5308,m352,FRANK,Where you comin' from?!
182792,L217942,u5309,m352,GAY BUM,"I'm a man with a mission, Jack."
182793,L217941,u5310,m352,JACK,Remember. One chorus and out.
182794,L217836,u5309,m352,GAY BUM,Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.
182795,L217835,u5310,m352,JACK,Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
182796,L217832,u5309,m352,GAY BUM,"Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing ""Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud."
182797,L217831,u5310,m352,JACK,Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
182798,L217823,u5309,m352,GAY BUM,Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
182799,L217822,u5310,m352,JACK,Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?

182805,L217810,u5309,m352,GAY BUM,Leave me alone...I wanna go...
182806,L217809,u5313,m352,PARRY,It was a crime.
182807,L217808,u5309,m352,GAY BUM,Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
182808,L217805,u5309,m352,GAY BUM,NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!

182812,L217545,u5310,m352,JACK,<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
182813,L217544,u5311,m352,LEATHER,.....Me neither.
182814,L217543,u5311,m352,LEATHER,Good.  You believe this drunk?
182815,L217542,u5310,m352,JACK,Yes... I... I agree...
182816,L217541,u5311,m352,LEATHER,People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
182817,L217540,u5310,m352,JACK,I... I was just leaving.
182818,L217539,u5311,m352,LEATHER,You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
182819,L217495,u5310,m352,JACK,"I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE ""AND"" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT..."
182820,L217494,u5315,m352,SONDRA,I was nine in the sixties.
182821,L217493,u5310,m352,JACK,How un-sixties of you.
182822,L217492,u5315,m352,SONDRA,"No, I have to work."
182823,L217491,u5310,m352,JACK,I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
182824,L217490,u5315,m352,SONDRA,"Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi."
182825,L217489,u5310,m352,JACK,... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
182826,L217488,u5315,m352,SONDRA,Fine.
182827,L217487,u5310,m352,JACK,They're putting me on film tomorrow.
182828,L217486,u5315,m352,SONDRA,Fine.  I'll say no.
182829,L217485,u5310,m352,JACK,"You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood."
182830,L217484,u5315,m352,SONDRA,"You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page."
182831,L217483,u5310,m352,JACK,About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
182832,L217481,u5315,m352,SONDRA,You can ask.
182833,L217480,u5310,m352,JACK,Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
182834,L217993,u5310,m352,JACK,Tonight!  How's tonight?
182835,L217992,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
182836,L217990,u5310,m352,JACK,"Well, since you're a member, we could..."
182837,L217989,u5312,m352,LYDIA,How much?
182838,L217988,u5310,m352,JACK,"You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline..."
182839,L217967,u5310,m352,JACK,Yes.  They're free.
182840,L217966,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Free?
182841,L217965,u5310,m352,JACK,Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
182842,L217964,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Now what?
182843,L217959,u5310,m352,JACK,Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
182844,L217958,u5312,m352,LYDIA,So how do we do this?
182845,L217952,u5310,m352,JACK,"Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot."
182846,L217951,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
182847,L217936,u5310,m352,JACK,<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
182848,L217935,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
182849,L217934,u5310,m352,JACK,"You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested."
182850,L217933,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR."
182851,L217932,u5310,m352,JACK,Well there....  What's the difference?
182852,L217931,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
182853,L217930,u5310,m352,JACK,A list.
182854,L217929,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?"
182855,L217928,u5310,m352,JACK,Your name was picked.
182856,L217926,u5310,m352,JACK,All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
182857,L217925,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Which ones?
182858,L217924,u5310,m352,JACK,"Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies..."
182859,L217923,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Huh-huh.
182860,L217922,u5310,m352,JACK,"Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?"
182861,L217921,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Yes.
182862,L217919,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Yeah?  Who is this?
182863,L217918,u5310,m352,JACK,Hello Lydia?
182864,L217893,u5310,m352,JACK,No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
182865,L217892,u5314,m352,RECEPTIONIST,"God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her."
182866,L217891,u5310,m352,JACK,Lydia.  Lydia what?
182867,L217890,u5314,m352,RECEPTIONIST,"Oh, Lydia!"
182868,L217889,u5310,m352,JACK,Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
182869,L217888,u5314,m352,RECEPTIONIST,What girl?  I didn't notice.
182870,L217887,u5310,m352,JACK,Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
182871,L218266,u5310,m352,JACK,Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
182872,L218265,u5313,m352,PARRY,Beautiful night huh?
182873,L218068,u5313,m352,PARRY,I know!
182874,L218067,u5310,m352,JACK,"Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner."
182875,L218063,u5313,m352,PARRY,I'm still scared.
182876,L218062,u5310,m352,JACK,No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
182877,L218061,u5313,m352,PARRY,...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
182878,L218045,u5313,m352,PARRY,What are the other reasons?
182879,L218044,u5310,m352,JACK,No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
182880,L218043,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?"
182881,L218042,u5310,m352,JACK,In a bar called Hellfire.
182882,L218041,u5313,m352,PARRY,"I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?"
182883,L218040,u5310,m352,JACK,Will you stand still so I can do this!
182884,L218015,u5310,m352,JACK,<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
182885,L218014,u5313,m352,PARRY,Holdin' my penis...
182886,L217886,u5310,m352,JACK,Sure...
182887,L217885,u5313,m352,PARRY,Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
182888,L217884,u5310,m352,JACK,Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
182889,L217883,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Happily married, probably."
182890,L217882,u5310,m352,JACK,"Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere..."
182891,L217881,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Maybe, when we get the Grail..."
182892,L217880,u5310,m352,JACK,"Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century."
182893,L217879,u5313,m352,PARRY,I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
182894,L217873,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, ""You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men""...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, ""What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?""...And the King says, ""I need a sip of water to cool my throat""...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, ""How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find""? And the fool answers, ""I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty.""... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool."
182895,L217872,u5310,m352,JACK,What?
182896,L217871,u5313,m352,PARRY,Are there any questions?
182897,L217867,u5313,m352,PARRY,Bingo!
182898,L217866,u5310,m352,JACK,YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
182899,L217865,u5313,m352,PARRY,Who are you talking to Jack?
182900,L217864,u5310,m352,JACK,..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
182901,L217863,u5310,m352,JACK,NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
182902,L217862,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!"
182903,L217861,u5310,m352,JACK,You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
182904,L217860,u5313,m352,PARRY,Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
182905,L217859,u5310,m352,JACK,.....What are you doing?
182906,L217858,u5310,m352,JACK,Yes. I think that's very fair.
182907,L217857,u5313,m352,PARRY,Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
182908,L217856,u5310,m352,JACK,Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
182909,L217850,u5313,m352,PARRY,It's a classic.
182910,L217849,u5310,m352,JACK,It's such a great song.
182911,L217814,u5310,m352,JACK,"Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?"
182912,L217813,u5313,m352,PARRY,Who?
182913,L217812,u5310,m352,JACK,"Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him."
182914,L217807,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be."
182915,L217806,u5310,m352,JACK,Parry...
182916,L217798,u5310,m352,JACK,"The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?"
182917,L217797,u5313,m352,PARRY,The Red Knight!
182918,L217796,u5310,m352,JACK,SAW WHO!!?
182919,L217794,u5310,m352,JACK,WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
182920,L217793,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!"
182921,L217788,u5310,m352,JACK,"You're totally gone, aren't you?"
182922,L217787,u5313,m352,PARRY,He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
182923,L217784,u5310,m352,JACK,"WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?..."
182924,L217783,u5313,m352,PARRY,So what? You going to help me?
182925,L217782,u5310,m352,JACK,I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
182926,L217781,u5313,m352,PARRY,That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
182927,L217780,u5310,m352,JACK,"I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit..."
182928,L217779,u5313,m352,PARRY,You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
182929,L217778,u5310,m352,JACK,I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
182930,L217777,u5313,m352,PARRY,You're a true <u>friend</u>.
182931,L217776,u5310,m352,JACK,Will you shut-up!!!
182932,L217775,u5313,m352,PARRY,I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
182933,L217774,u5310,m352,JACK,"Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?"
182934,L217773,u5313,m352,PARRY,"...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?"
182935,L217772,u5310,m352,JACK,No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
182936,L217771,u5313,m352,PARRY,Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
182937,L217770,u5310,m352,JACK,I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
182938,L217769,u5313,m352,PARRY,I don't need a job. I have a quest.
182939,L217768,u5310,m352,JACK,"Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job..."
182940,L217767,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail."
182941,L217766,u5310,m352,JACK,All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
182942,L217765,u5313,m352,PARRY,O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
182943,L217764,u5310,m352,JACK,You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
182944,L217763,u5313,m352,PARRY,Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
182945,L217762,u5313,m352,PARRY,You really want to help me?
182946,L217761,u5310,m352,JACK,I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
182947,L217760,u5313,m352,PARRY,Well what am I gonna do with it?
182948,L217759,u5310,m352,JACK,But I gave it to you!
182949,L217758,u5310,m352,JACK,What are you doing?  Give that back!
182950,L217757,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!"
182951,L217754,u5310,m352,JACK,No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
182952,L217753,u5313,m352,PARRY,Can I take you to lunch?
182953,L217752,u5310,m352,JACK,That's O.K.
182954,L217751,u5313,m352,PARRY,"No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack..."
182955,L217750,u5310,m352,JACK,"Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!"
182956,L217749,u5313,m352,PARRY,Fifty dollars?
182957,L217748,u5310,m352,JACK,Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
182958,L217746,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack..."
182959,L217745,u5310,m352,JACK,Why did you do that?
182960,L217744,u5313,m352,PARRY,I don't know.
182961,L217743,u5310,m352,JACK,What's her name?
182962,L217742,u5313,m352,PARRY,Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
182963,L217741,u5310,m352,JACK,Do you follow her every day?
182964,L217728,u5310,m352,JACK,Parry!
182965,L217727,u5313,m352,PARRY,"""Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee""...."
182966,L217661,u5313,m352,PARRY,Funny -- you look married.
182967,L217660,u5310,m352,JACK,I'm not married.
182968,L217659,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids."
182969,L217658,u5310,m352,JACK,Thanks... You can keep the doll.
182970,L217657,u5313,m352,PARRY,I know...
182971,L217656,u5310,m352,JACK,Parry... I'm Jack.
182972,L217655,u5313,m352,PARRY,Parry.
182973,L217654,u5310,m352,JACK,"Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh..."
182974,L217653,u5313,m352,PARRY,"See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it..."
182975,L217651,u5313,m352,PARRY,But I can't get it... He's...
182976,L217650,u5310,m352,JACK,"I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows..."
182977,L217649,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Oh, please... you're embarrassing me."
182978,L217648,u5310,m352,JACK,I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
182979,L217647,u5310,m352,JACK,Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not <u>any</u> One...
182980,L217646,u5313,m352,PARRY,I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
182981,L217645,u5310,m352,JACK,The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
182982,L217640,u5313,m352,PARRY,God... I'm the janitor of God.
182983,L217639,u5310,m352,JACK,Him...?
182984,L217638,u5313,m352,PARRY,They work for Him.
182985,L217637,u5310,m352,JACK,The Little...
182986,L217636,u5313,m352,PARRY,But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
182987,L217635,u5310,m352,JACK,A quest?
182988,L217634,u5313,m352,PARRY,"No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest."
182989,L217633,u5310,m352,JACK,Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
182990,L217632,u5313,m352,PARRY,Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
182991,L217631,u5310,m352,JACK,Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
182992,L217630,u5313,m352,PARRY,... Do you know who I am?
182993,L217627,u5310,m352,JACK,"I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes..."
182994,L217626,u5313,m352,PARRY,"... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know."
182995,L217625,u5313,m352,PARRY,<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!
182996,L217624,u5310,m352,JACK,I'm the one what?
182997,L217623,u5313,m352,PARRY,They said you're The One.
182998,L217622,u5310,m352,JACK,The Little People?
182999,L217621,u5313,m352,PARRY,Do you know what the Little People just told me?
183000,L217618,u5313,m352,PARRY,Sshhhh!
183001,L217617,u5310,m352,JACK,<u>What</u>?!

183009,L217609,u5310,m352,JACK,Where am I?
183010,L217608,u5310,m352,JACK,"If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh."
183011,L217607,u5313,m352,PARRY,Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
183012,L217606,u5310,m352,JACK,Have I died?
183013,L217586,u5313,m352,PARRY,Great place huh?
183014,L217585,u5310,m352,JACK,This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
183015,L217577,u5313,m352,PARRY,I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
183016,L217576,u5310,m352,JACK,I need a drink.
183017,L217573,u5313,m352,PARRY,"""OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!"
183018,L217572,u5310,m352,JACK,Please don't hurt me?

183027,L217558,u5313,m352,PARRY,I advise you to let us go.
183028,L217557,u5313,m352,PARRY,BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!

183035,L217549,u5313,m352,PARRY,Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
183036,L218143,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Shhh...
183037,L218142,u5313,m352,PARRY,... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
183038,L218141,u5313,m352,PARRY,Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...
183039,L218140,u5312,m352,LYDIA,You have a disease.
183040,L218139,u5313,m352,PARRY,"No, I..."
183041,L218138,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Divorced.
183042,L218137,u5313,m352,PARRY,No.
183043,L218136,u5312,m352,LYDIA,You're married.
183044,L218135,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?"
183045,L218134,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Oh... You mean you don't want to.
183046,L218133,u5313,m352,PARRY,"So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea."
183047,L218132,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"Listen, you're very nice... b..."
183048,L218131,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part."
183049,L218130,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"Listen, I'm not feeling well."
183050,L218129,u5313,m352,PARRY,Excuse me...
183051,L218128,u5312,m352,LYDIA,And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
183052,L218127,u5313,m352,PARRY,I don't drink coffee...
183053,L218126,u5312,m352,LYDIA,... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
183054,L218125,u5313,m352,PARRY,I don't drink coffee...
183055,L218124,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
183056,L218123,u5313,m352,PARRY,What are we about to do?
183057,L218122,u5312,m352,LYDIA,I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
183058,L218121,u5313,m352,PARRY,I never say anything I have to.
183059,L218120,u5312,m352,LYDIA,You don't have to say that.
183060,L218119,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Well, it's enough for me."
183061,L218118,u5312,m352,LYDIA,"No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it."
183062,L218117,u5313,m352,PARRY,Don't say that.
183063,L218116,u5312,m352,LYDIA,There isn't any more to tell.
183064,L218115,u5313,m352,PARRY,Tell me more. I want to know everything.
183065,L218097,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail."
183066,L218096,u5312,m352,LYDIA,What do you do - for a living I mean?
183067,L218093,u5313,m352,PARRY,We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
183068,L218092,u5312,m352,LYDIA,How do you know him?
183069,L218082,u5313,m352,PARRY,Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
183070,L218081,u5312,m352,LYDIA,We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
183071,L218078,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
183072,L218077,u5313,m352,PARRY,It sounds exciting.
183073,L218076,u5312,m352,LYDIA,...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
183074,L217979,u5313,m352,PARRY,Yeah.
183075,L217978,u5312,m352,LYDIA,What a gyp.
183076,L217977,u5313,m352,PARRY,... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
183077,L217976,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Got any Ethel Merman?
183078,L217975,u5313,m352,PARRY,"Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands..."
183079,L217974,u5312,m352,LYDIA,I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
183080,L217973,u5313,m352,PARRY,"How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's ""The Purple Bread,"" an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles."
183081,L217972,u5312,m352,LYDIA,I don't like horror movies!
183082,L217971,u5313,m352,PARRY,"How about the ""Hell Merchants""?"
183083,L217957,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Oh...like Moses.
183084,L217956,u5313,m352,PARRY,No just Parry.
183085,L217955,u5312,m352,LYDIA,Parry Parry?
183086,L218340,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?"
183087,L218339,u5316,m353,BETTY,"Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front."
183088,L218338,u5317,m353,BOBBY,A wig?
183089,L218337,u5316,m353,BETTY,"That's a wig you wear, isn't it?"
183090,L218336,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time..."
183091,L218335,u5316,m353,BETTY,"Yeah, 'cause she's so ""twinky""..."
183092,L218334,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Twinky?
183093,L218333,u5316,m353,BETTY,"My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky."
183094,L218332,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I leave it to you.
183095,L218331,u5316,m353,BETTY,"See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?"
183096,L218425,u5321,m353,ELTON,"I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you..."
183097,L218424,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!"
183098,L218410,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!"
183099,L218409,u5321,m353,ELTON,"If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say."
183100,L218407,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!"
183101,L218406,u5321,m353,ELTON,"Well, id'n that nice."
183102,L218378,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
183103,L218377,u5321,m353,ELTON,"Give 'em the horn, Bob."
183104,L218323,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you."
183105,L218322,u5321,m353,ELTON,We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
183106,L219017,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Fill it up.
183107,L219016,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Sure you don't want anything?
183108,L219013,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,You got any change?
183109,L219012,u5317,m353,BOBBY,No.
183110,L219011,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
183111,L218996,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"No, let's go..."
183112,L218995,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
183113,L218994,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Come on.
183114,L218946,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone..."
183115,L218945,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Bobby...
183116,L218886,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"I don't, huh?"
183117,L218885,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
183118,L218880,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?"
183119,L218879,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Just finish eating.
183120,L218878,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,What?
183121,L218877,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Rayette.
183122,L218866,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I don't know.
183123,L218865,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?"
183124,L218651,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Okay...
183125,L218650,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days."
183126,L218649,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,It brings out my eyes...
183127,L218648,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Sure...
183128,L218647,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
183129,L218646,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Okay, Ray..."
183130,L218644,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Bobby, don't talk like that..."
183131,L218643,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then."
183132,L218642,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
183133,L218641,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone."
183134,L218640,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
183135,L218633,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known..."
183136,L218632,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back."
183137,L218631,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Well, is that a happy face I see?"
183138,L218630,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Who said I was depressed?
183139,L218629,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,You're depressed that I come along.
183140,L218628,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Is what you?
183141,L218627,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?"
183142,L218626,u5317,m353,BOBBY,No.
183143,L218625,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?"
183144,L218590,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Shut up! All of you!
183145,L218589,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!"
183146,L218548,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
183147,L218547,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What?
183148,L218533,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What the hell is that?
183149,L218532,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"""Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."""
183150,L218531,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"""You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."""
183151,L218530,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I love it.
183152,L218529,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,You like it?
183153,L218521,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"You'll be gone, period."
183154,L218520,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I'll be gone two or three weeks.
183155,L218372,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Do you love me, Bobby?"
183156,L218371,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
183157,L218370,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint."
183158,L218369,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl."
183159,L218368,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,You're goin' a find me dead one time.
183160,L218367,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all."
183161,L218366,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Now, hand..."
183162,L218365,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way..."
183163,L218364,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I'm sorry.
183164,L218363,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,You treat me like I was.
183165,L218362,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I know you're not.
183166,L218361,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,I'm not some piece a crap.
183167,L218360,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I'm going on over there...
183168,L218359,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"You're the pathetic one, not me."
183169,L218358,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time."
183170,L218355,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,I hope they do.
183171,L218354,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
183172,L218353,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Yes.
183173,L218352,u5317,m353,BOBBY,You just going to sit there?
183174,L218351,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,I'm not.
183175,L218350,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
183176,L218316,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful."
183177,L218315,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it..."
183178,L218313,u5317,m353,BOBBY,You got another ball comin'.
183179,L218312,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"I did, didn' I, El?"
183180,L218311,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
183181,L218310,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me..."
183182,L218309,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form..."
183183,L218308,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Is it my turn again?
183184,L218304,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through..."
183185,L218303,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now."
183186,L218294,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"That's right, hand."
183187,L218293,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"You know what, you are never satisfied."
183188,L218292,u5317,m353,BOBBY,You can sing the song.
183189,L218291,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me."
183190,L218289,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Out where?
183191,L218288,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out."
183192,L218284,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"No, dammit, I would easy."
183193,L218283,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Now, now."
183194,L218282,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Serveza yourself!
183195,L218281,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Cerveza.
183196,L218280,u5317,m353,BOBBY,You're playing the other side.
183197,L218279,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?"
183198,L218278,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
183199,L218277,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
183200,L218275,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  ""When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."""
183201,L218274,u5317,m353,BOBBY,You said.
183202,L218273,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song."
183203,L218272,u5317,m353,BOBBY,No.
183204,L218271,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Well, lemme play the other side then."
183205,L218270,u5317,m353,BOBBY,You're not going to play it again.
183206,L218616,u5322,m353,PALM,"No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out."
183207,L218615,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"I didn't get it, did I?"
183208,L218614,u5322,m353,PALM,"Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast."
183209,L218604,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?"
183210,L218603,u5322,m353,PALM,"Hey, mack!"
183211,L218577,u5322,m353,PALM,"It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt..."
183212,L218576,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Well...
183213,L218564,u5322,m353,PALM,"Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it."
183214,L218563,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Who?
183215,L218562,u5322,m353,PALM,"I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it."
183216,L218560,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
183217,L218559,u5322,m353,PALM,I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
183218,L218558,u5317,m353,BOBBY,How do you know it's clean?
183219,L218557,u5322,m353,PALM,You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
183220,L218554,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Alaska? Are you on vacation?
183221,L218553,u5322,m353,PALM,Alaska.
183222,L218552,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Where are you going?
183223,L218551,u5322,m353,PALM,We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
183224,L218550,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Washington.
183225,L218549,u5322,m353,PALM,How far are you going to?
183226,L218544,u5322,m353,PALM,Palm Apodaca.
183227,L218543,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What's your name?
183228,L218540,u5322,m353,PALM,"Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a lift?"
183229,L218539,u5317,m353,BOBBY,You're lucky no one was hurt.
183230,L218538,u5322,m353,PALM,"Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!"
183231,L218610,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
183232,L218609,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,You want me to hold the chicken.
183233,L218608,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules."
183234,L218607,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,"One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?"
183235,L218606,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee."
183236,L218605,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,I don't make the rules.
183237,L218602,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,Would you like to talk to the manager?
183238,L218601,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?"
183239,L218600,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,"I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll."
183240,L218599,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee."
183241,L218598,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
183242,L218597,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want."
183243,L218596,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
183244,L218595,u5317,m353,BOBBY,But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
183245,L218594,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,No. We have tomatoes.
183246,L218593,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
183247,L218592,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,No substitutions.
183248,L218326,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,Five'll do it.
183249,L218325,u5317,m353,BOBBY,No. How much do I owe you?
183250,L218324,u5329,m353,WAITRESS,Can I get you anything else?
183251,L218348,u5328,m353,TWINKY,"I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty..."
183252,L218347,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Well, you seem very professional..."
183253,L218346,u5328,m353,TWINKY,"I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess."
183254,L218330,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe."
183255,L218329,u5328,m353,TWINKY,She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
183256,L218328,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Am I on TV?
183257,L218327,u5328,m353,TWINKY,We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
183258,L218318,u5328,m353,TWINKY,Are you talking to us?
183259,L218317,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Wasn't it, ladies?"
183260,L218993,u5327,m353,TITA,"Bye, Robert."
183261,L218992,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Bye, now."
183262,L218989,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"I'll say goodbye to you, Tita."
183263,L218988,u5327,m353,TITA,But what about me?
183264,L218987,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
183265,L218986,u5327,m353,TITA,You were going without saying goodbye?
183266,L218985,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself..."
183267,L218984,u5327,m353,TITA,You're leaving?
183268,L218955,u5327,m353,TITA,"Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!"
183269,L218954,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"I'm talking to you, Tita!"
183270,L218952,u5327,m353,TITA,I don't know where she is!
183271,L218951,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Where's Catherine?!
183272,L218950,u5327,m353,TITA,It's none of your business!
183273,L218800,u5327,m353,TITA,My turn.
183274,L218799,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Where is she, anyway?"
183275,L218789,u5327,m353,TITA,"Sailors are sadistic, I feel."
183276,L218788,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?"
183277,L218787,u5327,m353,TITA,"You know, he was formerly a sailor."
183278,L218786,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I think he's got a terrific personality.
183279,L218784,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Yeah, well, he's..."
183280,L218783,u5327,m353,TITA,I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
183281,L218782,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
183282,L218781,u5327,m353,TITA,Why are you being so mean?
183283,L218780,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Look at that.
183284,L218764,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"No, thanks..."
183285,L218763,u5327,m353,TITA,With applesauce?
183286,L218762,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What?
183287,L218761,u5327,m353,TITA,Do you want some gingerbread?
183288,L218716,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I don't know.
183289,L218715,u5327,m353,TITA,"Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?"
183290,L218714,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"There's nothing to say, Tita..."
183291,L218713,u5327,m353,TITA,"Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you..."
183292,L218712,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or..."
183293,L218711,u5327,m353,TITA,Like what?
183294,L218710,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself..."
183295,L218709,u5327,m353,TITA,"Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but..."
183296,L218708,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Uhm hmm.
183297,L218707,u5327,m353,TITA,"Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself..."
183298,L218706,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?"
183299,L218705,u5327,m353,TITA,"I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements..."
183300,L218704,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"No, I don't really think you're a freak."
183301,L218703,u5327,m353,TITA,Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
183302,L218702,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Sort of.
183303,L218701,u5327,m353,TITA,"No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?"
183304,L218700,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
183305,L218699,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Sometimes.
183306,L218698,u5327,m353,TITA,"Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?"
183307,L218697,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What questions?
183308,L218695,u5327,m353,TITA,"We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to..."
183309,L218694,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago."
183310,L218693,u5327,m353,TITA,"I mean, you think I'm that happy?"
183311,L218692,u5327,m353,TITA,"A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes."
183312,L218691,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone."
183313,L218690,u5327,m353,TITA,It's not that bad.
183314,L218689,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Uhm hmm. Some range.
183315,L218688,u5327,m353,TITA,"He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes..."
183316,L218677,u5327,m353,TITA,A couple of months.
183317,L218676,u5317,m353,BOBBY,How long have you been staying here?
183318,L218674,u5327,m353,TITA,I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
183319,L218673,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Well, I really appreciate it, Carl."
183320,L218510,u5327,m353,TITA,All right...
183321,L218509,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Tita, I've got to go..."
183322,L218508,u5327,m353,TITA,"It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really..."
183323,L218507,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Yeah, me, too..."
183324,L218506,u5327,m353,TITA,"Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming..."
183325,L218505,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?"
183326,L218504,u5327,m353,TITA,"No, I need to talk to you, about so many things..."
183327,L218503,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Maybe you better stay, then."
183328,L218498,u5327,m353,TITA,Wait...
183329,L218497,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Well...  I better let you...
183330,L218496,u5327,m353,TITA,I know.
183331,L218495,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most."
183332,L218494,u5317,m353,BOBBY,No...
183333,L218493,u5327,m353,TITA,I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
183334,L218492,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Yeah... I guess so...
183335,L218488,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Don't tell me about this...
183336,L218487,u5327,m353,TITA,"He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either..."
183337,L218486,u5327,m353,TITA,He's had two strokes.
183338,L218485,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Oh, well, what, what's he..."
183339,L218484,u5327,m353,TITA,Daddy's very ill.
183340,L218483,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What?
183341,L218482,u5327,m353,TITA,"Robert, I have to tell you something..."
183342,L218481,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
183343,L218480,u5327,m353,TITA,"It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin."
183344,L218478,u5327,m353,TITA,"Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck..."
183345,L218477,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
183346,L218476,u5327,m353,TITA,Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
183347,L218475,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Who's Van Oost?
183348,L218474,u5327,m353,TITA,"Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost."
183349,L218473,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Everybody still up on the Island?
183350,L218472,u5327,m353,TITA,I have to talk seriously with you...
183351,L218471,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Very nice.
183352,L218470,u5327,m353,TITA,Robert...
183353,L218468,u5317,m353,BOBBY,No kidding.
183354,L218467,u5327,m353,TITA,Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
183355,L218466,u5317,m353,BOBBY,No.
183356,L218465,u5327,m353,TITA,You know who it once belonged to?
183357,L218464,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Oh.
183358,L218463,u5327,m353,TITA,"This is a very special, very old CB 275..."
183359,L218462,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Sorry.
183360,L218461,u5327,m353,TITA,"Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there..."
183361,L218460,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita."
183362,L218459,u5327,m353,TITA,You always do this to me.
183363,L218458,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Don't, then."
183364,L218457,u5327,m353,TITA,I just can't look at you.
183365,L218456,u5317,m353,BOBBY,That's good.
183366,L218455,u5327,m353,TITA,"No, I'm not...  I'm not."
183367,L218454,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Now don't...
183368,L218453,u5327,m353,TITA,Robert Eroica...
183369,L218452,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Hi, Tita."
183370,L218451,u5327,m353,TITA,Oh my goodness... Bobby...
183371,L218449,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Would you tell her Bobby's here?
183372,L218448,u5327,m353,TITA,Tea.
183373,L218973,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry."
183374,L218972,u5317,m353,BOBBY,That'll make you happy.
183375,L218971,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Yes.
183376,L218970,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?"
183377,L218969,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you...  I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?"
183378,L218968,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Just give me a chance, will you?"
183379,L218967,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever..."
183380,L218904,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"Please, I'll see you later this evening."
183381,L218903,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Catherine...
183382,L218902,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert..."
183383,L218901,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,What?! I can't hear you!
183384,L218900,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Oh. You have to tell me that.
183385,L218899,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
183386,L218898,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Will you let me talk to you, please?"
183387,L218897,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"No, I can't..."
183388,L218894,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Yes, it is!"
183389,L218893,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary..."
183390,L218892,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about..."
183391,L218891,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I'll be back later...
183392,L218890,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I have to talk to you.
183393,L218889,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
183394,L218888,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Where are you going?
183395,L218860,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Of course I'd like to.
183396,L218859,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to."
183397,L218858,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What?
183398,L218857,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Robert?
183399,L218856,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Yeah, I think I could."
183400,L218855,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
183401,L218854,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Yes.
183402,L218853,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Is he?
183403,L218852,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
183404,L218851,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I'm fine.
183405,L218850,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?"
183406,L218849,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Something witty and devastating like that.
183407,L218848,u5317,m353,BOBBY,That's what you said?
183408,L218847,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him..."
183409,L218846,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I don't believe vou.
183410,L218845,u5317,m353,BOBBY,That's right.
183411,L218844,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,No inner feeling.
183412,L218843,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Shut up...
183413,L218842,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"No, don't do that..."
183414,L218840,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"Yes, that's what's important to me..."
183415,L218839,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Serious, that's what's important to you?"
183416,L218837,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
183417,L218836,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you."
183418,L218835,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I don't find your language that charming.
183419,L218831,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Some bath oil?
183420,L218830,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
183421,L218829,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?"
183422,L218828,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath."
183423,L218827,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow..."
183424,L218826,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I don't think that's accurate...
183425,L218825,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response."
183426,L218824,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary."
183427,L218823,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"No, it isn't what I think."
183428,L218822,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I think it's what you think.
183429,L218821,u5317,m353,BOBBY,You think I'm a fake.
183430,L218819,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed."
183431,L218818,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Catherine...
183432,L218817,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,At being a fake.
183433,L218816,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What?
183434,L218815,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"Well, at least you're accomplished at something..."
183435,L218814,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Wait...
183436,L218813,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Then I must have been supplying it.
183437,L218812,u5317,m353,BOBBY,None.
183438,L218811,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,You had no inner feeling?
183439,L218810,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I didn't have any.
183440,L218809,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
183441,L218808,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
183442,L218807,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Why?
183443,L218806,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way."
183444,L218805,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Is that funny?
183445,L218804,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I was really very moved by the way you...
183446,L218803,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Thank you.
183447,L218802,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised..."
183448,L218754,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Of course I do. It's music. You know...
183449,L218753,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"You don't call that music, though."
183450,L218752,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue."
183451,L218751,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me..."
183452,L218749,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I gave it a second thought.
183453,L218748,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought..."
183454,L218744,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Yeah, I'll probably be free."
183455,L218743,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,If you're free.
183456,L218742,u5317,m353,BOBBY,The day after tomorrow.
183457,L218741,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
183458,L218740,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Tomorrow's a full practice day...  But the day after is kind of open.
183459,L218739,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Tomorrow, then."
183460,L218738,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile."
183461,L218737,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Then after that?
183462,L218736,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
183463,L218734,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
183464,L218733,u5317,m353,BOBBY,That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
183465,L218732,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
183466,L218731,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Nothing.
183467,L218730,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do."
183468,L218729,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?"
183469,L218728,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What would I do with it? Run amok?
183470,L218727,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Why?
183471,L218726,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself."
183472,L218725,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating."
183473,L218724,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
183474,L218723,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Swimming?
183475,L218722,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"That's dangerous, you know."
183476,L218721,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"Yes, intentionally."
183477,L218720,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I guess you fell in the water.
183478,L218719,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,Hello...
183479,L218667,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,And you no longer play at all?
183480,L218666,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting."
183481,L218665,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,What have you been doing since then?
183482,L218944,u5317,m353,BOBBY,You're all full of shit!
183483,L218943,u5318,m353,CARL,"Robert, I think you better just..."
183484,L218884,u5318,m353,CARL,"Robert, let's not be rude, okay?"
183485,L218883,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Oh, for chrissakes..."
183486,L218794,u5317,m353,BOBBY,I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
183487,L218793,u5318,m353,CARL,"All right, let's have a rematch."
183488,L218792,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"That's three games to none, Carl."
183489,L218791,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"At game, Carl."
183490,L218790,u5318,m353,CARL,See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
183491,L218776,u5317,m353,BOBBY,That's what I mean...
183492,L218775,u5318,m353,CARL,"I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response..."
183493,L218772,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
183494,L218771,u5318,m353,CARL,I'm not aware of it. Like what?
183495,L218769,u5318,m353,CARL,"What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape."
183496,L218768,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"You sure you should be playing, Carl?"
183497,L218757,u5318,m353,CARL,Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
183498,L218756,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What?
183499,L218755,u5318,m353,CARL,"Robert, do you mind?"
183500,L218687,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"Thanks, Carl..."
183501,L218686,u5318,m353,CARL,"I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here."
183502,L218684,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Is she?
183503,L218683,u5318,m353,CARL,"She's tremendously gifted, this girl."
183504,L218680,u5318,m353,CARL,"It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this..."
183505,L218679,u5317,m353,BOBBY,What?
183506,L218678,u5318,m353,CARL,"Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?"
183507,L218659,u5318,m353,CARL,"No, the last time was three years ago."
183508,L218658,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Four or five years.
183509,L219024,u5317,m353,BOBBY,It's all right. I'm fine.
183510,L219023,u5320,m353,DRIVER,"Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell."
183511,L219022,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"No, it's okay."
183512,L219021,u5320,m353,DRIVER,"I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on."
183513,L219020,u5317,m353,BOBBY,"No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on..."
183514,L219019,u5320,m353,DRIVER,Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
183515,L218896,u5317,m353,BOBBY,Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
183516,L218895,u5320,m353,DRIVER,"Come on, get moving, dammit!!"
183517,L218930,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me..."
183518,L218929,u5318,m353,CARL,It's a Borzoi.
183519,L218928,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,What kind of doggy is that?
183520,L218882,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?"
183521,L218881,u5318,m353,CARL,"No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time."
183522,L218873,u5318,m353,CARL,Not at all.
183523,L218872,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say."
183524,L218871,u5318,m353,CARL,"Oh, no. You're more than welcome."
183525,L218870,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself..."
183526,L218869,u5318,m353,CARL,I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
183527,L218868,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away..."
183528,L218867,u5318,m353,CARL,You've been staying in a motel all this time?
183529,L218747,u5318,m353,CARL,I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
183530,L218746,u5327,m353,TITA,"What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything..."
183531,L218672,u5318,m353,CARL,"At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, ""What for?"" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that..."
183532,L218671,u5327,m353,TITA,I hope I didn't hear that.
183533,L218670,u5318,m353,CARL,"I don't know where you were, penis envy."
183534,L218669,u5327,m353,TITA,"Oh, my, ""a summit conference."" I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin."
183535,L218668,u5318,m353,CARL,"You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you..."
183536,L218664,u5327,m353,TITA,Besides being very rude.
183537,L218663,u5318,m353,CARL,It is true.
183538,L218662,u5327,m353,TITA,I don't think that's true.
183539,L218661,u5318,m353,CARL,"Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all."
183540,L218660,u5327,m353,TITA,"Oh no, it's been much more than that."
183541,L218926,u5324,m353,SAMIA,"Well, I should hope not..."
183542,L218925,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me."
183543,L218924,u5324,m353,SAMIA,"But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure..."
183544,L218923,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"I think these cold, ""objective"" discussions are aggressive, Samia..."
183545,L218922,u5324,m353,SAMIA,"... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage."
183546,L218921,u5324,m353,SAMIA,"Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married..."
183547,L218920,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,"No, I wouldn't."
183548,L218919,u5324,m353,SAMIA,What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
183549,L218918,u5319,m353,CATHERINE,And what about love?
183550,L218588,u5322,m353,PALM,Hold onto this.
183551,L218587,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,You better hold onto your tongue!
183552,L218586,u5322,m353,PALM,I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
183553,L218585,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Don't call me ""mack,"" honey."
183554,L218584,u5322,m353,PALM,"Don't call me ""honey,"" mack."
183555,L218583,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know."
183556,L218582,u5322,m353,PALM,Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
183557,L218581,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,That's an old maid's tale.
183558,L218580,u5322,m353,PALM,"Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop."
183559,L218579,u5322,m353,PALM,"Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots..."
183560,L218578,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,Well...
183561,L218566,u5322,m353,PALM,"A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning."
183562,L218565,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all..."
183563,L218542,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Jesus, what a rude person..."
183564,L218541,u5322,m353,PALM,"Come on, Terry, we got a ride!"
183565,L218624,u5322,m353,PALM,"Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it..."
183566,L218623,u5326,m353,TERRY,Steam.
183567,L218622,u5322,m353,PALM,"And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water..."
183568,L218574,u5322,m353,PALM,"And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere..."
183569,L218573,u5326,m353,TERRY,"Yeah, it could be adorable..."
183570,L218572,u5322,m353,PALM,"In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with..."
183571,L218571,u5326,m353,TERRY,"In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean..."
183572,L218570,u5322,m353,PALM,"Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes..."
183573,L218569,u5326,m353,TERRY,"Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean."
183574,L218568,u5322,m353,PALM,"What do you mean ""mass""... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either."
183575,L218567,u5326,m353,TERRY,Mass production is what does it.
183576,L218936,u5324,m353,SAMIA,Perhaps...
183577,L218935,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"Well, she was."
183578,L218934,u5324,m353,SAMIA,"The choice of words, ""squashed flat,"" juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten..."
183579,L218915,u5324,m353,SAMIA,"I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media..."
183580,L218914,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes."
183581,L218913,u5324,m353,SAMIA,Pardon me?
183582,L218912,u5323,m353,RAYETTE,"There's some good things on it, though."
183583,L218911,u5324,m353,SAMIA,"John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world..."
183584,L218444,u5327,m353,TITA,"Oh, for pity's sake..."
183585,L218443,u5325,m353,SECOND ENGINEER,I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
183586,L218442,u5327,m353,TITA,Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
183587,L218441,u5325,m353,SECOND ENGINEER,"That's exactly what I am doing, again."
183588,L218440,u5327,m353,TITA,"Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all."
183589,L218439,u5325,m353,SECOND ENGINEER,If you want to call it that.
183590,L218438,u5327,m353,TITA,Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
183591,L218437,u5325,m353,SECOND ENGINEER,"I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy."
183592,L218436,u5327,m353,TITA,Yes.

183602,L219110,u5334,m354,DONNA,"God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand."
183603,L219109,u5330,m354,AARON,Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
183604,L219108,u5334,m354,DONNA,"For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'."
183605,L219107,u5330,m354,AARON,Then don't go out with me.
183606,L219106,u5334,m354,DONNA,"I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated."
183607,L219105,u5330,m354,AARON,So get the fuck outta here.
183608,L219104,u5334,m354,DONNA,"Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is."
183609,L219103,u5330,m354,AARON,"Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck."
183610,L219102,u5334,m354,DONNA,"God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you."
183611,L219101,u5330,m354,AARON,"Not now, I'm busy"

183774,L219640,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats."
183775,L219639,u5339,m355,BOYD,Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
183776,L219638,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --"
183777,L219949,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Oh, thanks."
183778,L219948,u5340,m355,CLERK,"Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here."
183779,L219947,u5345,m355,FLETCH,What?
183780,L219946,u5340,m355,CLERK,You mean her.
183781,L219945,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
183782,L219943,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
183783,L219942,u5340,m355,CLERK,"We'd have no way of knowing that, sir."
183784,L219941,u5345,m355,FLETCH,So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
183785,L219940,u5340,m355,CLERK,Would you like me to change anything?
183786,L219939,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You're kidding.
183787,L219938,u5340,m355,CLERK,"Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class."
183788,L219675,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Not luck. They don't want me.
183789,L219674,u5341,m355,CREASY,You're lucky.
183790,L219673,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I busted their window, they didn't do anything."
183791,L219672,u5341,m355,CREASY,What? What are you talking about?
183792,L219671,u5345,m355,FLETCH,They didn't do anything.
183793,L219670,u5341,m355,CREASY,Hey you're really nuts.
183794,L219668,u5345,m355,FLETCH,What goddamn right do you have to take him?
183795,L219667,u5341,m355,CREASY,Fletch!
183796,L219664,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"You don't have to run with me, Crease."
183797,L219663,u5341,m355,CREASY,"Fletch, this is dumb."
183798,L219662,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Hey, what are you doing?"
183799,L219321,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You're not taking real good care of yourself.
183800,L219320,u5341,m355,CREASY,Nineteen.
183801,L219319,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Creasy, how old are you?"
183802,L219318,u5341,m355,CREASY,I ought to get some sleep.
183803,L219317,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy."
183804,L219316,u5341,m355,CREASY,"He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?"
183805,L219315,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I wasn't asking.
183806,L219314,u5341,m355,CREASY,I have no idea.
183807,L219313,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Wonder who his supplier is.
183808,L219312,u5341,m355,CREASY,Sonofabitch.
183809,L219311,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
183810,L219310,u5341,m355,CREASY,He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
183811,L219309,u5345,m355,FLETCH,That's what he said.
183812,L219308,u5341,m355,CREASY,Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
183813,L219307,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Maybe tonight?
183814,L220192,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Go ahead. Make my evening.
183815,L220191,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,This one's going to be even more fun.
183816,L220177,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Thank God, the police."
183817,L220176,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"Greetings, everyone."
183818,L219772,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?"
183819,L219771,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,Thanks for coming down to see us.
183820,L219770,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,That a boy.
183821,L219769,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Not a prayer.
183822,L219768,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?"
183823,L219767,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
183824,L219766,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?"
183825,L219765,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,What'll it be Fletch?
183826,L219764,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
183827,L219763,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Can I ask anybody now?
183828,L219762,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,Ask anybody.
183829,L219761,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"My God, you're serious."
183830,L219760,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way."
183831,L219759,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights."
183832,L219758,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
183833,L219757,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You can't keep me here.
183834,L219755,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great."
183835,L219754,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it."
183836,L219752,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops."
183837,L219751,u5345,m355,FLETCH,'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
183838,L219750,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men."
183839,L219749,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down."
183840,L219748,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?"
183841,L219747,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"It was planted on me, sir."
183842,L219746,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
183843,L219745,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you."
183844,L219744,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
183845,L219743,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
183846,L219742,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?"
183847,L219741,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Fletch F. Fletch
183848,L219740,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,Full name.
183849,L219739,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Fletch.
183850,L219738,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
183851,L219737,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
183852,L220189,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
183853,L220188,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,"Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything."
183854,L220186,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?"
183855,L220185,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,"I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow."
183856,L220184,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
183857,L220183,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
183858,L220182,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,"I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now."
183859,L220179,u5342,m355,CUMMINGS,"Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them."
183860,L220178,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,What the hell are you doing here?
183861,L219514,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant."
183862,L219513,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
183863,L219512,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
183864,L219511,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,"Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now."
183865,L219510,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?"
183866,L219509,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,"I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you."
183867,L219508,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?"
183868,L219507,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,Just relax.
183869,L219506,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?"
183870,L219505,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,There is?
183871,L219504,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family."
183872,L219503,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,Breathe easy...
183873,L219502,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
183874,L219501,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Honest, I feel fine. You better be married."
183875,L219500,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,Just relax....
183876,L219499,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that..."
183877,L219498,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,"Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar."
183878,L219497,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy."
183879,L219496,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
183880,L219495,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Sure, but the end was so sudden."
183881,L219494,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,"Oh, he was dying for years."
183882,L219493,u5345,m355,FLETCH,It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
183883,L219492,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
183884,L219491,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Is she ever. I've got some stories....
183885,L219490,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,Funny old bird.
183886,L219489,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Margaret.
183887,L219488,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,"Well, which one?"
183888,L219487,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Right.
183889,L219486,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,Joan or Margaret Smith.
183890,L219485,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Mrs. Smith.
183891,L219484,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,Your aunt?
183892,L219483,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt."
183893,L219482,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,"Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry."
183894,L219481,u5345,m355,FLETCH,No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
183895,L219480,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,No children?
183896,L219479,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I don't know. I don't have any.
183897,L219478,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
183898,L219477,u5345,m355,FLETCH,But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
183899,L219476,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,That's two.
183900,L219475,u5345,m355,FLETCH,One. B-a-b-a-r.
183901,L219474,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,Two bs?
183902,L219473,u5345,m355,FLETCH,That's Babar.
183903,L219472,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,"Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?"
183904,L219471,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains."
183905,L219470,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
183906,L219469,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Yes.
183907,L219468,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,Really. The California Racquet Club?
183908,L219467,u5345,m355,FLETCH,We play tennis at the club.
183909,L219466,u5343,m355,DR. DOLEN,So where do you know Alan from?
183910,L220118,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,"Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive."
183911,L220117,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Gum thought Brazil.
183912,L220116,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,You find the source?
183913,L220115,u5345,m355,FLETCH,What?
183914,L220114,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
183915,L220113,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that."
183916,L220112,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
183917,L220111,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You don't have a piece of the action?
183918,L220110,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,"Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort."
183919,L220109,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
183920,L220108,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,You gonna nail the chief?
183921,L220107,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition."
183922,L220106,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,Thought so. What for?
183923,L220105,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Affirmative.
183924,L220104,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,The two surfer boys?
183925,L220103,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Affirmative.
183926,L220102,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,"What, the heat here?"
183927,L220101,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I'm serious, Sam."
183928,L220100,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,My pleasure.
183929,L220099,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You don't know me.
183930,L220098,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,Jesus.
183931,L219298,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, dont you?"
183932,L219297,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,Fletch...
183933,L219296,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I think Id rather have drugs.
183934,L219295,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,"No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?"
183935,L219294,u5345,m355,FLETCH,For sure?
183936,L219293,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,Like tonight.
183937,L219292,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Like when?
183938,L219291,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,Okay. Some idea.
183939,L219290,u5345,m355,FLETCH,No idea at all?
183940,L219289,u5344,m355,FAT SAM,No idea.
183941,L219288,u5345,m355,FLETCH,So what do you figure?
183942,L219550,u5345,m355,FLETCH,He'll be so relieved.
183943,L219549,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,I guess not.
183944,L219548,u5345,m355,FLETCH,This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
183945,L219547,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,That's it.
183946,L219546,u5345,m355,FLETCH,That's it?
183947,L219545,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,"Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign."
183948,L219544,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it."
183949,L219543,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,Is there anything particular you're looking for?
183950,L219542,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Thank you.
183951,L219541,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,"Here you are, Doctor."
183952,L219540,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,"Yes, right away."
183953,L219539,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something."
183954,L219538,u5345,m355,FLETCH,It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
183955,L219537,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,Oh my God!
183956,L219536,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother."
183957,L219535,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
183958,L219534,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding."
183959,L219533,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,Can I get you something?
183960,L219532,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm fine.
183961,L219531,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,You're in the Records Room.
183962,L219530,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Where am I?
183963,L219529,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,"Are you all right, Doctor?"
183964,L219519,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Right. Fine.
183965,L219518,u5356,m355,RECORDS NURSE,Nothing. They're still there.
183966,L219517,u5345,m355,FLETCH,It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
183967,L219579,u5347,m355,GILLETT,Till then.
183968,L219578,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
183969,L219577,u5347,m355,GILLETT,Cash. I'm impressed.
183970,L219576,u5347,m355,GILLETT,"This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages."
183971,L219575,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Damn... lost again. Sorry.
183972,L219573,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
183973,L219572,u5347,m355,GILLETT,"That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars."
183974,L219571,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Are you serious?
183975,L219570,u5347,m355,GILLETT,You may be right.
183976,L219569,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too."
183977,L219568,u5347,m355,GILLETT,I agree.
183978,L219567,u5345,m355,FLETCH,My lawyer was a bum.
183979,L219566,u5347,m355,GILLETT,You should have proved that in a court of law.
183980,L219565,u5345,m355,FLETCH,She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
183981,L219564,u5347,m355,GILLETT,"I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out."
183982,L219563,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this."
183983,L219562,u5347,m355,GILLETT,"Until she remarries, Fletch."
183984,L219561,u5345,m355,FLETCH,It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
183985,L219560,u5347,m355,GILLETT,I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
183986,L219559,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it."
183987,L219558,u5347,m355,GILLETT,You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
183988,L219555,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
183989,L219554,u5347,m355,GILLETT,I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
183990,L219553,u5345,m355,FLETCH,What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
183991,L219552,u5347,m355,GILLETT,"Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch."
183992,L220172,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Whoops.
183993,L220171,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
183994,L220166,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up."
183995,L220165,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,And what was that?
183996,L220164,u5345,m355,FLETCH,The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
183997,L220163,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,"Bravo, Mr. Fletcher."
183998,L220161,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
183999,L220160,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,I'd have been long gone.
184000,L220159,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan."
184001,L220154,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,"'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'"
184002,L220153,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
184003,L220152,u5345,m355,FLETCH,He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
184004,L220149,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Cut the crap and read it.
184005,L220148,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,Wait a second --
184006,L220147,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Read this, please."
184007,L220146,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,What?
184008,L220145,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe."
184009,L220144,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,"Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?"
184010,L220143,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,Of course.
184011,L220142,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
184012,L220141,u5353,m355,MR. STANWYK,Good evening.
184013,L220029,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --"
184014,L220028,u5352,m355,MARVIN,"Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April."
184015,L220025,u5352,m355,MARVIN,Of course they are.
184016,L220024,u5345,m355,FLETCH,And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
184017,L220023,u5345,m355,FLETCH,He sighs.
184018,L220018,u5352,m355,MARVIN,Course he has. That's his wife.
184019,L220017,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Then he has.
184020,L220016,u5352,m355,MARVIN,"Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?"
184021,L220015,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Has he?
184022,L220008,u5352,m355,MARVIN,"Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his."
184023,L220007,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy."
184024,L220006,u5352,m355,MARVIN,What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
184025,L220005,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo."
184026,L220004,u5352,m355,MARVIN,Since he moved to L.A.
184027,L220003,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Isn't that nice. Since when?
184028,L220002,u5352,m355,MARVIN,That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
184029,L220001,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Ten days ago?
184030,L220000,u5352,m355,MARVIN,"Oh, about ten days ago."
184031,L219999,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?"
184032,L219998,u5352,m355,MARVIN,Check.
184033,L219997,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?"
184034,L219996,u5352,m355,MARVIN,Velma.
184035,L219995,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named...."
184036,L219993,u5352,m355,MARVIN,Come on in.
184037,L219992,u5345,m355,FLETCH,California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
184038,L219991,u5352,m355,MARVIN,"Yes. Where you from, Harry?"
184039,L219990,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son."
184040,L219989,u5352,m355,MARVIN,"Well, I'm fully covered."
184041,L219988,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Right.
184042,L219987,u5352,m355,MARVIN,"Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?"
184043,L219986,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
184044,L219985,u5352,m355,MARVIN,Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
184045,L219984,u5345,m355,FLETCH,My parents were great fans of the former President.
184046,L219983,u5352,m355,MARVIN,Harry S. Truman?
184047,L219982,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
184048,L220208,u5345,m355,FLETCH,No problem.
184049,L220207,u5346,m355,GAIL,"I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you."
184050,L220206,u5345,m355,FLETCH,What are you doing here?
184051,L220205,u5346,m355,GAIL,"Not mine, stupid. Yours."
184052,L220204,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --"
184053,L220203,u5346,m355,GAIL,"God, I haven't seen you since the wedding."
184054,L220202,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Right.
184055,L220201,u5346,m355,GAIL,"John Ultramalensky, right?"
184056,L220197,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You sure did.
184057,L220196,u5346,m355,GAIL,"I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?"
184058,L220195,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
184059,L220194,u5346,m355,GAIL,Where are you going?
184060,L220193,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
184061,L220096,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Wait here for me, Gummy."
184062,L220095,u5348,m355,GUMMY,Yeah. Maybe.
184063,L220094,u5345,m355,FLETCH,That's Brazil.
184064,L220093,u5348,m355,GUMMY,"Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?"
184065,L220092,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Rio de Janeiro, maybe?"
184066,L220091,u5348,m355,GUMMY,"I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget."
184067,L220090,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Where does the Chief get the drugs?
184068,L220088,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Twenty years.
184069,L220087,u5348,m355,GUMMY,"Fletch, I never sold nothing."
184070,L220086,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Sure you did.
184071,L220085,u5348,m355,GUMMY,I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
184072,L220084,u5345,m355,FLETCH,He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
184073,L220083,u5348,m355,GUMMY,What's that?
184074,L220082,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
184075,L220080,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy."
184076,L220079,u5348,m355,GUMMY,Why are they after you?
184077,L220078,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum."
184078,L220077,u5348,m355,GUMMY,What?
184079,L220076,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
184080,L220075,u5348,m355,GUMMY,Fletch?
184081,L220074,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm the Sufi.
184082,L219305,u5348,m355,GUMMY,I know. I got bad luck or something.
184083,L219304,u5345,m355,FLETCH,They bust you every week.
184084,L219303,u5348,m355,GUMMY,They busted me last week.
184085,L219302,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I know.
184086,L219301,u5348,m355,GUMMY,Its okay. The cops did it.
184087,L219300,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
184088,L219299,u5348,m355,GUMMY,Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
184089,L219401,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Sure.
184090,L219400,u5357,m355,STANWYK,Will you kill me?
184091,L219399,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service."
184092,L219398,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You sure got the hard part.
184093,L219397,u5357,m355,STANWYK,That's right.
184094,L219396,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying."
184095,L219395,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else."
184096,L219394,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You sure those doors will be open?
184097,L219393,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent."
184098,L219392,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?"
184099,L219391,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent."
184100,L219390,u5345,m355,FLETCH,They serve dinner on the flight?
184101,L219389,u5357,m355,STANWYK,Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
184102,L219388,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Where am I going?
184103,L219387,u5357,m355,STANWYK,LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
184104,L219386,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Take it where?
184105,L219385,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment."
184106,L219384,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Sure, all drifters do."
184107,L219383,u5357,m355,STANWYK,Do you have a passport?
184108,L219382,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
184109,L219381,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"Get me on the first shot, if you can."
184110,L219380,u5345,m355,FLETCH,What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
184111,L219379,u5357,m355,STANWYK,Precisely. Are you a good shot?
184112,L219378,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you."
184113,L219377,u5357,m355,STANWYK,Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
184114,L219376,u5345,m355,FLETCH,A .357.
184115,L219375,u5357,m355,STANWYK,In this drawer....
184116,L219374,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy."
184117,L219373,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?"
184118,L219372,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I have the same problem with my help.
184119,L219371,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets."
184120,L219370,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Wouldn't they normally be locked?
184121,L219369,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open."
184122,L219368,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm still here.
184123,L219366,u5357,m355,STANWYK,I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
184124,L219365,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
184125,L219364,u5357,m355,STANWYK,Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
184126,L219363,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Maybe I'm just on vacation.
184127,L219362,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks."
184128,L219361,u5345,m355,FLETCH,So why pick me?
184129,L219360,u5357,m355,STANWYK,My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
184130,L219359,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Why don't you try suicide?
184131,L219358,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it."
184132,L219357,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk."
184133,L219353,u5357,m355,STANWYK,I want you to murder me.
184134,L219352,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm all ears.
184135,L219351,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent."
184136,L219345,u5357,m355,STANWYK,Come inside.
184137,L219344,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that."
184138,L219342,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
184139,L219341,u5357,m355,STANWYK,Who?
184140,L219340,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
184141,L219335,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Charmed.
184142,L219334,u5357,m355,STANWYK,Alan Stanwyk.
184143,L219333,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Nugent. Ted Nugent.
184144,L219332,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr..."
184145,L219331,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
184146,L219330,u5357,m355,STANWYK,"I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut."
184147,L219329,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I think you've got the wrong gal, fella."
184148,L219328,u5357,m355,STANWYK,I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
184149,L219327,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
184150,L219326,u5357,m355,STANWYK,Because we can't.
184151,L219325,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Why not?
184152,L219324,u5357,m355,STANWYK,We can't talk about it here.
184153,L220037,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar."
184154,L220036,u5349,m355,LARRY,I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
184155,L220035,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank."
184156,L220034,u5349,m355,LARRY,"I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday."
184157,L219701,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Nothing to it.
184158,L219700,u5349,m355,LARRY,My hero.
184159,L219690,u5349,m355,LARRY,"That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile."
184160,L219689,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Yeah.
184161,L219688,u5349,m355,LARRY,Did you say cops?
184162,L219685,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while."
184163,L219684,u5349,m355,LARRY,"Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---"
184164,L219465,u5349,m355,LARRY,Only one way to find out.
184165,L219464,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I wonder if that's his doctor.
184166,L219463,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'"
184167,L219462,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Maybe.
184168,L219461,u5349,m355,LARRY,You doing a story on this guy?
184169,L219460,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Thanks.
184170,L219459,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Spot right here.
184171,L219458,u5349,m355,LARRY,"Not our kind of people, you understand."
184172,L219457,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'"
184173,L219456,u5349,m355,LARRY,"Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin."
184174,L219455,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'"
184175,L219419,u5349,m355,LARRY,"No problem, boss."
184176,L219418,u5345,m355,FLETCH,W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
184177,L219416,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away."
184178,L219415,u5349,m355,LARRY,Not me.
184179,L219414,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Did you hear something?
184180,L219412,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Don't say shoot, okay."
184181,L219411,u5349,m355,LARRY,Shoot.
184182,L219410,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
184183,L219409,u5349,m355,LARRY,"'Magic' today, huh?"
184184,L219408,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Deal.
184185,L219407,u5349,m355,LARRY,Only if you promise not to return me.
184186,L219406,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Can I steal you for a minute?
184187,L219405,u5349,m355,LARRY,Yo!
184188,L220032,u5358,m355,VELMA,How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
184189,L220031,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"No, thank you."
184190,L220030,u5358,m355,VELMA,"Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?"
184191,L220027,u5345,m355,FLETCH,How long have they been married?
184192,L220026,u5358,m355,VELMA,She's cute as a button.
184193,L220022,u5358,m355,VELMA,"Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some."
184194,L220021,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
184195,L220020,u5358,m355,VELMA,Cute thing.
184196,L220019,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?"
184197,L220012,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You've met her?
184198,L220011,u5358,m355,VELMA,His bride. Cute as a button.
184199,L220010,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm sorry?
184200,L220009,u5358,m355,VELMA,"Cute young thing, too."
184201,L220181,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?"
184202,L220180,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
184203,L220158,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I want to hear this.
184204,L220157,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You shouldn't be here.
184205,L220156,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Don't worry, I can take it."
184206,L220071,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Come here.
184207,L220070,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I'm terrified.
184208,L220067,u5345,m355,FLETCH,They're trying to kill me!
184209,L220066,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Don't tell me I can't --
184210,L220065,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You can't do that.
184211,L220064,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I'm calling the police. Right now.
184212,L220063,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow."
184213,L220062,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Bastard.
184214,L220061,u5345,m355,FLETCH,And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
184215,L220060,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
184216,L220059,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
184217,L220058,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I checked. There was no divorce.
184218,L220057,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,What is this....
184219,L220055,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Gail, please."
184220,L220054,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Oh God, I hate things that start like that...."
184221,L220053,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I think you better sit down.
184222,L220052,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
184223,L220050,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
184224,L220049,u5345,m355,FLETCH,No.
184225,L220048,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
184226,L220047,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"What's wrong, Gail?"
184227,L219914,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?"
184228,L219913,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I was afraid you'd say that.
184229,L219912,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Act natural.
184230,L219911,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
184231,L219910,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
184232,L219909,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,What are you talking about?
184233,L219908,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'll take you to a game.
184234,L219907,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
184235,L219906,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?"
184236,L219905,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know."
184237,L219904,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me."
184238,L219900,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
184239,L219899,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
184240,L219898,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
184241,L219895,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You saw a forgery.
184242,L219894,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,But I've seen the deed.
184243,L219893,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush."
184244,L219892,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
184245,L219891,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
184246,L219890,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,What does all this mean?
184247,L219889,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad."
184248,L219888,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,How do you know about that?
184249,L219887,u5345,m355,FLETCH,He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
184250,L219884,u5345,m355,FLETCH,That's what I want to know.
184251,L219883,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,What are you talking about?
184252,L219882,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth."
184253,L219881,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,So?
184254,L219880,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
184255,L219879,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Who.
184256,L219878,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
184257,L219877,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
184258,L219876,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Yeah.
184259,L219875,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
184260,L219874,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Why did you do it?
184261,L219873,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him."
184262,L219872,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"I think you should call me Gail, now."
184263,L219871,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk."
184264,L219863,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Long story.
184265,L219862,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,What is this?
184266,L219861,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Thanks for the great time.
184267,L219858,u5345,m355,FLETCH,How come?
184268,L219857,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,He never sees them and I never met them.
184269,L219856,u5345,m355,FLETCH,What about his parents?
184270,L219855,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there."
184271,L219854,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Good point.
184272,L219853,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
184273,L219852,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?"
184274,L219851,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry."
184275,L219850,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Why'd you let me in?
184276,L219849,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else."
184277,L219848,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Are you still in love with Alan?
184278,L219847,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Depends on the question.
184279,L219846,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Can I ask you a question?
184280,L219845,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Just like Alan. It's freaky.
184281,L219844,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'"
184282,L219843,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Your bone structure, shoulders, neck..."
184283,L219842,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'"
184284,L219841,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,It's amazing.
184285,L219840,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'"
184286,L219829,u5345,m355,FLETCH,No. He was. I got him out.
184287,L219828,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,You were in the war?
184288,L219827,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I saved his life during the war.
184289,L219826,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,All this goes on Underhill's bill?
184290,L219820,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,God...
184291,L219819,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Lunch...
184292,L219818,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Yes.
184293,L219817,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
184294,L219815,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Here, take mine."
184295,L219814,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I mean put clothes on.
184296,L219813,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today."
184297,L219812,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I really should change.
184298,L219811,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Down boy.
184299,L219810,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be."
184300,L219809,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,You ordered it here?
184301,L219808,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I ordered lunch.
184302,L219807,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?"
184303,L219806,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
184304,L219805,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
184305,L219804,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I was hoping you'd say that.
184306,L219803,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Hi.
184307,L219802,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Hi.
184308,L219801,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,John Ultramalensky?
184309,L219800,u5345,m355,FLETCH,It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
184310,L219799,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Who is it?
184311,L219631,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off."
184312,L219630,u5345,m355,FLETCH,What's he doing in Utah?
184313,L219629,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,See what I mean?
184314,L219628,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You are a rich woman.
184315,L219627,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman."
184316,L219626,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
184317,L219625,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?"
184318,L219624,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
184319,L219623,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Alan's in Utah.
184320,L219622,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?"
184321,L219621,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I bet you do.
184322,L219620,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I have this effect on lots of women.
184323,L219619,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
184324,L219616,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I love the outfits.
184325,L219615,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Why do you keep doing this?
184326,L219613,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!"
184327,L219612,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Preoccupied with what?
184328,L219611,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
184329,L219610,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
184330,L219609,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Damn, I thought I had that one."
184331,L219601,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Please.
184332,L219600,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
184333,L219599,u5345,m355,FLETCH,So were my parents.
184334,L219598,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,That's a strange combination.
184335,L219597,u5345,m355,FLETCH,It's Scotch-Rumanian.
184336,L219596,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really."
184337,L219595,u5345,m355,FLETCH,John Ultrarelamensky.
184338,L219594,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,John who?
184339,L219593,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,John! You used to fly together!
184340,L219592,u5345,m355,FLETCH,We used to fly together. I'm... John.
184341,L219591,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?"
184342,L219590,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours."
184343,L219589,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,"I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are."
184344,L219588,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great."
184345,L220199,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought."
184346,L220198,u5359,m355,WAITER,Your call is come through.
184347,L219825,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Sierra del fuego.
184348,L219824,u5359,m355,WAITER,Muchas gracias.
184349,L219823,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill."
184350,L219822,u5359,m355,WAITER,You want I set up?
184351,L219797,u5359,m355,WAITER,"Very good, sir."
184352,L219796,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
184353,L219795,u5359,m355,WAITER,I recommend it.
184354,L219794,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
184355,L219793,u5359,m355,WAITER,"Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion."
184356,L219792,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
184357,L219791,u5359,m355,WAITER,"Charged to the Underhills, sir?"
184358,L219790,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I would, actually."
184359,L219789,u5359,m355,WAITER,"Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?"
184360,L219788,u5345,m355,FLETCH,One.
184361,L219787,u5359,m355,WAITER,Cabana one.
184362,L219786,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?"
184363,L219785,u5359,m355,WAITER,"In her cabana, sir."
184364,L219784,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?"
184365,L219608,u5359,m355,WAITER,Very good sir.
184366,L219607,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
184367,L219606,u5359,m355,WAITER,Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
184368,L219605,u5345,m355,FLETCH,They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
184369,L219604,u5359,m355,WAITER,"They just left, sir."
184370,L219603,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Yes, I'm with the Underhills."
184371,L219602,u5359,m355,WAITER,Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
184372,L219977,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
184373,L219976,u5350,m355,MAN,Tell the cops.
184374,L219975,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm her cousin.
184375,L219974,u5350,m355,MAN,I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
184376,L219973,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
184377,L219972,u5350,m355,MAN,What did you want under the bed?
184378,L219971,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over."
184379,L219970,u5350,m355,MAN,This morning.
184380,L219969,u5345,m355,FLETCH,So you're saying she moved out.
184381,L219968,u5350,m355,MAN,She moved out.
184382,L219967,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
184383,L219966,u5345,m355,FLETCH,She moved out?
184384,L219965,u5350,m355,MAN,Moved out.
184385,L219964,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Where is she?
184386,L219963,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
184387,L219962,u5350,m355,MAN,Who are you?
184388,L219961,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
184389,L219960,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I commend him on his choice
184390,L219959,u5350,m355,MAN,What?
184391,L219958,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I commend him on his choice.
184392,L219957,u5350,m355,MAN,I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
184393,L219956,u5345,m355,FLETCH,No wonder.
184394,L219955,u5350,m355,MAN,Lock's busted.
184395,L219954,u5345,m355,FLETCH,The door was unlocked.
184396,L219323,u5345,m355,FLETCH,What?
184397,L219322,u5350,m355,MAN,Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
184398,L220139,u5360,m355,WALKER,Fletch.
184399,L220138,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
184400,L220137,u5360,m355,WALKER,I was upset.
184401,L220136,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Not really?
184402,L220135,u5360,m355,WALKER,Not really.
184403,L220134,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"You were going to can me, right?"
184404,L220133,u5360,m355,WALKER,"Fletch, you want an apology?"
184405,L220129,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Forget it.
184406,L220128,u5360,m355,WALKER,"Fletch, I got nervous. Please...."
184407,L220127,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me."
184408,L220124,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship."
184409,L220123,u5360,m355,WALKER,What...
184410,L220122,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy."
184411,L220121,u5360,m355,WALKER,What?  Who the hell are they?
184412,L220120,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight."
184413,L219783,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Print this Frank.
184414,L219782,u5360,m355,WALKER,I want something I can print!
184415,L219781,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank."
184416,L219780,u5360,m355,WALKER,"But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs."
184417,L219779,u5345,m355,FLETCH,You'll have it.
184418,L219778,u5360,m355,WALKER,"You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow."
184419,L219777,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story."
184420,L219776,u5360,m355,WALKER,Get out of here.
184421,L219775,u5345,m355,FLETCH,It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
184422,L219774,u5360,m355,WALKER,"It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about."
184423,L219773,u5345,m355,FLETCH,How could you call him?
184424,L219699,u5360,m355,WALKER,"Go to transportation, get a ticket."
184425,L219698,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt."
184426,L219697,u5360,m355,WALKER,Who? Donnie and Marie?
184427,L219696,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I have some ideas.
184428,L219695,u5360,m355,WALKER,What about finding the source?
184429,L219694,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
184430,L219693,u5360,m355,WALKER,Utah?
184431,L219692,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank."
184432,L219687,u5345,m355,FLETCH,All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
184433,L219686,u5360,m355,WALKER,"Just give me a hint, all right?"
184434,L219679,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?"
184435,L219678,u5360,m355,WALKER,You're onto something. That's good. What?
184436,L219677,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here."
184437,L219676,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Gummy and two cops...
184438,L219453,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope."
184439,L219452,u5360,m355,WALKER,"I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?"
184440,L219451,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I'd say charcoal.
184441,L219450,u5360,m355,WALKER,How gray?
184442,L219449,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Well, there we're in a gray area."
184443,L219448,u5360,m355,WALKER,Who?
184444,L219447,u5345,m355,FLETCH,He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
184445,L219446,u5360,m355,WALKER,So let's go! We run the pictures.
184446,L219445,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I have pictures of him. Dealing...
184447,L219444,u5360,m355,WALKER,What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
184448,L219443,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Practically.
184449,L219442,u5360,m355,WALKER,You broke it? You know the source?
184450,L219441,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it."
184451,L219440,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Why not? Oh shit... really?
184452,L219439,u5360,m355,WALKER,"Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story."
184453,L219436,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Looks great.
184454,L219435,u5360,m355,WALKER,I don't know.  Look!
184455,L219434,u5345,m355,FLETCH,What's the spread on the game tonight?
184456,L219433,u5360,m355,WALKER,...never reads the paper...
184457,L219432,u5345,m355,FLETCH,I never read the paper.
184458,L219431,u5360,m355,WALKER,No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
184459,L219430,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?"
184460,L219429,u5360,m355,WALKER,"Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!"
184461,L219428,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Oh, I hate it when he calls me that."
184462,L219427,u5360,m355,WALKER,Irwin...
184463,L219426,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Two...
184464,L219425,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"And a damn fine one, I might add."
184465,L219424,u5360,m355,WALKER,"'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer."
184466,L219423,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Uh, almost."
184467,L219422,u5360,m355,WALKER,"No, I want an answer, Is the story done?"
184468,L219421,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?"
184469,L219420,u5360,m355,WALKER,Fletch.
184470,L219653,u5345,m355,FLETCH,My secretary.
184471,L219652,u5351,m355,MARGIE,Who's Frieda?
184472,L219651,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Frieda's boss.
184473,L219650,u5351,m355,MARGIE,"And, I'm sorry, who are you again?"
184474,L219649,u5345,m355,FLETCH,Yeah.
184475,L219648,u5351,m355,MARGIE,Jim Swarthout?
184476,L219647,u5345,m355,FLETCH,"Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?"
184477,L219886,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,In a minute!
184478,L219885,u5354,m355,MR. UNDERHILL,Mrs. Stanwyk!
184479,L219869,u5354,m355,MR. UNDERHILL,Of course.
184480,L219868,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
184481,L219867,u5354,m355,MR. UNDERHILL,I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
184482,L219866,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,You don't know the Underhills?
184483,L219865,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,John!
184484,L219864,u5354,m355,MR. UNDERHILL,"Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill."
184485,L219860,u5354,m355,MR. UNDERHILL,"Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member."
184486,L219859,u5355,m355,MRS. STANWYK,Yes?
184487,L220481,u5364,m356,FORD,I ain't -- got -- you.
184488,L220480,u5361,m356,BAND,"I said, I ain't got you..."
184489,L220479,u5364,m356,FORD,"I said, I ain't got you..."
184490,L220478,u5361,m356,BAND,"No, I ain't got you..."
184491,L220477,u5364,m356,FORD,"No, I ain't got you..."
184492,L220476,u5361,m356,BAND,But I ain't got you...
184493,L220475,u5364,m356,FORD,But I ain't got you...
184494,L220664,u5364,m356,FORD,"Thanks, I needed that."
184495,L220663,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,Art Mo-o-o-ney!
184496,L220661,u5364,m356,FORD,What did these Vancouver factories do?
184497,L220660,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,That was close...
184498,L220658,u5364,m356,FORD,Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
184499,L220657,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
184500,L220656,u5364,m356,FORD,"What cheap shit... hey, waiter!"
184501,L220655,u5364,m356,FORD,But I am...
184502,L220654,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved..."
184503,L220652,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache..."
184504,L220651,u5364,m356,FORD,Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
184505,L220650,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,Did she tell you anything?
184506,L220649,u5364,m356,FORD,Have what?
184507,L220648,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
184508,L220647,u5364,m356,FORD,I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
184509,L220646,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
184510,L220531,u5364,m356,FORD,Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
184511,L220530,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
184512,L220529,u5364,m356,FORD,"Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now."
184513,L220528,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,I'll do my best.
184514,L220527,u5364,m356,FORD,They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
184515,L220526,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you."
184516,L220525,u5364,m356,FORD,"Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you."
184517,L220524,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,So you...
184518,L220523,u5364,m356,FORD,Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
184519,L220520,u5364,m356,FORD,"I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there."
184520,L220519,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
184521,L220510,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"Uh, let's go sit down."
184522,L220509,u5364,m356,FORD,"Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g..."
184523,L220508,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon."
184524,L220442,u5364,m356,FORD,Nuthin'.
184525,L220441,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,Who?
184526,L220440,u5364,m356,FORD,"Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night..."
184527,L220439,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then."
184528,L220438,u5364,m356,FORD,Oh... I have some questions.
184529,L220437,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"Actually, you may take it all now."
184530,L220436,u5364,m356,FORD,"Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty."
184531,L220435,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
184532,L220434,u5364,m356,FORD,"Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole."
184533,L220433,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,Excuse me?
184534,L220432,u5364,m356,FORD,No thanks.  I carry my own.
184535,L220431,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"But how did you know?  Here, take this picture..."
184536,L220430,u5364,m356,FORD,Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
184537,L220429,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
184538,L220428,u5364,m356,FORD,Now that we've broken the ice...
184539,L220427,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry."
184540,L220426,u5364,m356,FORD,"Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual."
184541,L220425,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?"
184542,L220424,u5364,m356,FORD,Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
184543,L220423,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,Who's your decorator?
184544,L220422,u5364,m356,FORD,"Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!"
184545,L220421,u5364,m356,FORD,"I don't know, I never met your father."
184546,L220420,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?"
184547,L220419,u5364,m356,FORD,Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
184548,L220418,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,Please.
184549,L220417,u5364,m356,FORD,Don't say it.  Orange juice?
184550,L220416,u5362,m356,COLLEEN,"Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and..."
184551,L220922,u5364,m356,FORD,No prob...
184552,L220921,u5363,m356,DON,"Thanks for the promotion, man."
184553,L220881,u5363,m356,DON,Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
184554,L220880,u5364,m356,FORD,"Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure."
184555,L220484,u5363,m356,DON,Right away!
184556,L220483,u5364,m356,FORD,"Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?"
184557,L220463,u5364,m356,FORD,I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
184558,L220462,u5363,m356,DON,Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
184559,L220452,u5363,m356,DON,Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
184560,L220451,u5364,m356,FORD,I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
184561,L220450,u5364,m356,FORD,Great pipes.
184562,L220449,u5363,m356,DON,"I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive."
184563,L220270,u5364,m356,FORD,"I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don..."
184564,L220269,u5363,m356,DON,You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
184565,L220258,u5363,m356,DON,"Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at..."
184566,L220257,u5364,m356,FORD,I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
184567,L220256,u5363,m356,DON,"Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy."
184568,L220255,u5364,m356,FORD,"So many assholes, so few bullets."
184569,L220955,u5366,m356,JAZZ,Wha --
184570,L220954,u5364,m356,FORD,"Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing."
184571,L220953,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting."
184572,L220875,u5366,m356,JAZZ,I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
184573,L220874,u5364,m356,FORD,"After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part..."
184574,L220869,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel."
184575,L220868,u5364,m356,FORD,"Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money."
184576,L220867,u5366,m356,JAZZ,C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
184577,L220866,u5364,m356,FORD,"Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?"
184578,L220865,u5366,m356,JAZZ,Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
184579,L220864,u5364,m356,FORD,What an interface!
184580,L220855,u5366,m356,JAZZ,Johnny's C.D.?
184581,L220854,u5364,m356,FORD,"Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know."
184582,L220757,u5364,m356,FORD,"Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number..."
184583,L220756,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?"
184584,L220751,u5366,m356,JAZZ,You're not funny.
184585,L220750,u5364,m356,FORD,"Aha, just what I suspected!"
184586,L220748,u5364,m356,FORD,"I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue..."
184587,L220747,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'"
184588,L220743,u5364,m356,FORD,"Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!"
184589,L220742,u5366,m356,JAZZ,I came to warn you...
184590,L220721,u5364,m356,FORD,What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
184591,L220720,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"Hello, Ford..."
184592,L220678,u5364,m356,FORD,"Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place."
184593,L220677,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"Ah, an obvious choice."
184594,L220676,u5366,m356,JAZZ,Who?
184595,L220675,u5364,m356,FORD,Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
184596,L220674,u5366,m356,JAZZ,You okay?
184597,L220645,u5366,m356,JAZZ,Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
184598,L220644,u5364,m356,FORD,"Yeah, let's bury her."
184599,L220643,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure..."
184600,L220638,u5364,m356,FORD,Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.
184601,L220637,u5366,m356,JAZZ,Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
184602,L220636,u5364,m356,FORD,"I don't know, what was the case?"
184603,L220633,u5364,m356,FORD,I like.
184604,L220632,u5366,m356,JAZZ,Contacts.
184605,L220631,u5364,m356,FORD,"What did you... Hey, where's your spex?"
184606,L220562,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man."
184607,L220561,u5364,m356,FORD,"I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we..."
184608,L220560,u5366,m356,JAZZ,Make eye contact when you say that.
184609,L220559,u5364,m356,FORD,I wish I knew.  You did good work...
184610,L220558,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about."
184611,L220557,u5364,m356,FORD,"A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?"
184612,L220556,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands..."
184613,L220555,u5364,m356,FORD,How'd you get this from her?
184614,L220554,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"Shut up, goodies from the ice queen."
184615,L220553,u5364,m356,FORD,Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
184616,L220544,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm."
184617,L220543,u5364,m356,FORD,"And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz."
184618,L220518,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"Go on, 'they're stahting.'"
184619,L220517,u5364,m356,FORD,You going to be okay?
184620,L220515,u5364,m356,FORD,"This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs..."
184621,L220514,u5366,m356,JAZZ,You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
184622,L220513,u5364,m356,FORD,"Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?"
184623,L220448,u5364,m356,FORD,"Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice."
184624,L220447,u5366,m356,JAZZ,Spooky.  I'll process her.
184625,L220446,u5364,m356,FORD,Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
184626,L220445,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?"
184627,L220444,u5364,m356,FORD,Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
184628,L220344,u5364,m356,FORD,Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
184629,L220343,u5366,m356,JAZZ,So what about this watch?
184630,L220342,u5364,m356,FORD,"Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again."
184631,L220341,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky..."
184632,L220338,u5364,m356,FORD,"I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?"
184633,L220337,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked."
184634,L220331,u5366,m356,JAZZ,"Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here..."
184635,L220330,u5364,m356,FORD,Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
184636,L220329,u5366,m356,JAZZ,You're saying you need money.
184637,L220328,u5364,m356,FORD,"Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford."

184763,L220409,u5372,m356,THE KID,This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.

184777,L220672,u5368,m356,LT. AMOS,That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
184778,L220671,u5364,m356,FORD,Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.

184781,L220668,u5368,m356,LT. AMOS,"God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is."
184782,L220667,u5364,m356,FORD,"That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun."
184783,L220666,u5368,m356,LT. AMOS,"Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you."
184784,L220404,u5364,m356,FORD,"You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really."

184796,L220391,u5368,m356,LT. AMOS,"Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?"
184797,L220390,u5364,m356,FORD,You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
184798,L220389,u5368,m356,LT. AMOS,"You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring..."

184800,L220940,u5371,m356,SMILEY,"Anyway you want it, asshole."

184802,L220938,u5371,m356,SMILEY,The point?
184803,L220937,u5364,m356,FORD,"You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!"
184804,L220936,u5371,m356,SMILEY,How's it going?
184805,L220835,u5364,m356,FORD,Okay.  'B-y-e!
184806,L220834,u5371,m356,SMILEY,<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
184807,L220833,u5364,m356,FORD,I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
184808,L220595,u5364,m356,FORD,Say cheese...
184809,L220594,u5371,m356,SMILEY,"Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it."
184810,L220593,u5364,m356,FORD,"You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!"
184811,L220507,u5364,m356,FORD,<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
184812,L220506,u5371,m356,SMILEY,Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
184813,L220505,u5364,m356,FORD,The case!
184814,L220504,u5371,m356,SMILEY,Off what?  Twenty seconds...
184815,L220503,u5364,m356,FORD,I'm off it!
184816,L220502,u5371,m356,SMILEY,What's fine?
184817,L220501,u5364,m356,FORD,Fine!
184818,L220500,u5371,m356,SMILEY,"Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds."
184819,L220499,u5364,m356,FORD,I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
184820,L220498,u5371,m356,SMILEY,"Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience."
184821,L220496,u5364,m356,FORD,"Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more."
184822,L220495,u5371,m356,SMILEY,Polo.
184823,L220917,u5364,m356,FORD,"Julian, you're fired."
184824,L220916,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,I'm still the king!
184825,L220909,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look."
184826,L220908,u5364,m356,FORD,"Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing."
184827,L220903,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?"
184828,L220902,u5364,m356,FORD,"Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but..."
184829,L220901,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got."
184830,L220900,u5364,m356,FORD,"Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company..."
184831,L220899,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,Fuck me...
184832,L220898,u5364,m356,FORD,"And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made..."
184833,L220897,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --"
184834,L220896,u5364,m356,FORD,You'd said something about proof...
184835,L220804,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,Ciao.
184836,L220803,u5364,m356,FORD,Shit.
184837,L220802,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window."
184838,L220801,u5364,m356,FORD,"When I say 'no,' run for the door."
184839,L220799,u5364,m356,FORD,Are you okay?
184840,L220798,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,Kill them.  Not quickly.
184841,L220788,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds."
184842,L220787,u5364,m356,FORD,What about Don?
184843,L220786,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland."
184844,L220785,u5364,m356,FORD,I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
184845,L220783,u5364,m356,FORD,"Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?"
184846,L220782,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
184847,L220781,u5364,m356,FORD,"<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us..."
184848,L220777,u5364,m356,FORD,"Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!"
184849,L220776,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,It doesn't have to be like this?
184850,L220772,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford."
184851,L220771,u5364,m356,FORD,"Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit."
184852,L220770,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!"
184853,L220765,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Golly, I'd probably faint."
184854,L220764,u5364,m356,FORD,"And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?"
184855,L220763,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,Shock.
184856,L220762,u5364,m356,FORD,"Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?"
184857,L220552,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Go on, another time, another place."
184858,L220551,u5364,m356,FORD,"Jazz, we're talking here."
184859,L220547,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
184860,L220546,u5364,m356,FORD,"Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?"
184861,L220545,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
184862,L220542,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
184863,L220541,u5364,m356,FORD,"Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm."
184864,L220540,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Well, hello, Ford."
184865,L220465,u5364,m356,FORD,I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
184866,L220464,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit."
184867,L220461,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
184868,L220460,u5364,m356,FORD,I knew your father.  He was quite...
184869,L220459,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person."
184870,L220458,u5364,m356,FORD,Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
184871,L220457,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,"Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel."
184872,L220456,u5365,m356,GRENDEL,Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
184873,L220455,u5364,m356,FORD,How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
184874,L220746,u5364,m356,FORD,It is to us!  It's computerised.
184875,L220745,u5369,m356,MELODI,This isn't music!
184876,L220716,u5364,m356,FORD,Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
184877,L220715,u5369,m356,MELODI,"Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about."
184878,L220713,u5364,m356,FORD,"Hey, the poet..."
184879,L220712,u5369,m356,MELODI,"Hi, private eye guy!"
184880,L220267,u5364,m356,FORD,I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
184881,L220266,u5369,m356,MELODI,"You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?"
184882,L220265,u5364,m356,FORD,"That's funny, you're cute."
184883,L220264,u5369,m356,MELODI,That's cute.  You're funny.
184884,L220263,u5364,m356,FORD,Only on a first name basis.
184885,L220262,u5369,m356,MELODI,Do you really know everybody in the industry?
184886,L220261,u5364,m356,FORD,You're a poet and didn't know it.
184887,L220260,u5369,m356,MELODI,"You're that guy, the private eye."
184888,L220367,u5367,m356,JOHNNY,"I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees."
184889,L220366,u5364,m356,FORD,Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
184890,L220365,u5367,m356,JOHNNY,I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
184891,L220364,u5367,m356,JOHNNY,"Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money."
184892,L220363,u5364,m356,FORD,I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
184893,L220362,u5367,m356,JOHNNY,So...
184894,L220359,u5367,m356,JOHNNY,What?
184895,L220358,u5364,m356,FORD,"'Bye, Johnny..."
184896,L220357,u5367,m356,JOHNNY,"It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --"
184897,L220356,u5364,m356,FORD,How nice.
184898,L220355,u5364,m356,FORD,Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
184899,L220354,u5367,m356,JOHNNY,I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
184900,L220353,u5364,m356,FORD,"Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard."
184901,L220352,u5367,m356,JOHNNY,"Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective."
184902,L220351,u5364,m356,FORD,I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
184903,L223511,u5374,m357,1ST MAN,What?
184904,L223510,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
184905,L223509,u5374,m357,1ST MAN,Mr. Doyle.
184906,L223508,u5382,m357,DOYLE,What?
184907,L223507,u5374,m357,1ST MAN,Doyle.
184908,L223506,u5382,m357,DOYLE,What's my name?
184909,L223559,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,This side.
184910,L223558,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Where do you want it?
184911,L223557,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,Who knows?
184912,L223556,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Who brings it?
184913,L223555,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,"Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well."
184914,L223554,u5382,m357,DOYLE,What?
184915,L223553,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,"No, nothing.  There's only some talk."
184916,L223552,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Got a wife named Angie.
184917,L223551,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,Doesn't register.
184918,L223550,u5382,m357,DOYLE,B.O.C.A.
184919,L223549,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,Boca?
184920,L223548,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn."
184921,L223547,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
184922,L223546,u5382,m357,DOYLE,How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
184923,L223545,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,Everything is everything.
184924,L223544,u5382,m357,DOYLE,How's everything?
184925,L223541,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Cause if I do.
184926,L223540,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,No - no.
184927,L223539,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
184928,L223538,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,No.
184929,L223537,u5382,m357,DOYLE,You don't use shit?
184930,L223536,u5375,m357,2ND MAN,I'm clean.
184931,L223535,u5382,m357,DOYLE,What about you?  Can you stand a toss?

184944,L223393,u5377,m357,BLACK PUSHER,"Man, I'm clean."
184945,L223392,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?"
184946,L223391,u5377,m357,BLACK PUSHER,No... yeah...
184947,L223390,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?

184956,L223936,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
184957,L223934,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
184958,L223933,u5381,m357,DEVEREAUX,"My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished."
184959,L223932,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
184960,L223931,u5381,m357,DEVEREAUX,I wasn't looking.
184961,L223930,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Did they follow you?
184962,L223929,u5381,m357,DEVEREAUX,It is waiting for you in the garage.
184963,L223928,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Did you pick up the car?
184964,L223466,u5381,m357,DEVEREAUX,"Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter."

184970,L223844,u5390,m357,SAL,Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
184971,L223843,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Are you having trouble raising the half million?
184972,L223842,u5390,m357,SAL,"Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears."
184973,L223841,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
184974,L223840,u5390,m357,SAL,"Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat."
184975,L223644,u5390,m357,SAL,Yes --
184976,L223643,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Twelve o'clock... yes...
184977,L223640,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,... Salvatore?...

184979,L223638,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Allo... Salvatore...
184980,L223853,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,That's a relief.
184981,L223852,u5385,m357,MARIE,I'm going to put them on the cat.
184982,L223851,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Are you sure it is dead?
184983,L223630,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,"Not any woman, Marie.  Just one."
184984,L223629,u5385,m357,MARIE,Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
184985,L223455,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Non!
184986,L223454,u5385,m357,MARIE,Le sommes nous?

184991,L223449,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Pour moi?
184992,L223448,u5385,m357,MARIE,"Mais non, c'est pour toi."
184993,L223447,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Avec a tu pourras le supporter.
184994,L223446,u5385,m357,MARIE,Regarde mon pcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire trs froid cet hiver.
184995,L223445,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Encore du sho ping!
184996,L223444,u5385,m357,MARIE,"Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai achet."

184999,L223441,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Tu sais j'ai rflchi longuement  ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-mme.  Tiens.
185000,L223866,u5388,m357,NICOLI,What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
185001,L223865,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,There'll be someone else.
185002,L223863,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,"Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one."
185003,L223862,u5388,m357,NICOLI,He is not wrong.
185004,L223861,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
185005,L223860,u5388,m357,NICOLI,But will they?
185006,L223859,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,We must follow it.
185007,L223858,u5388,m357,NICOLI,What happens to the schedule?
185008,L223857,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
185009,L223464,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler  la tlvision.
185010,L223463,u5388,m357,NICOLI,J'ai pas confiance en lui.
185011,L223462,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
185012,L223461,u5388,m357,NICOLI,Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
185013,L223460,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Il est en retard.
185014,L223459,u5388,m357,NICOLI,Il fallait le faire.
185015,L223458,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Sale boulot.
185016,L223628,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,Mmm.
185017,L223627,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
185018,L223626,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
185019,L223625,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,"If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list."
185020,L223621,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,Who financed it?
185021,L223620,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
185022,L223619,u5378,m357,CHARNIER,It's beautiful.
185023,L223533,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Fake it.
185024,L223532,u5379,m357,DANCER,I got no music!
185025,L223526,u5379,m357,DANCER,You're for real?
185026,L223525,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
185027,L223524,u5379,m357,DANCER,What?
185028,L223523,u5389,m357,RUSSO,"All right, get up on that bar and dance."
185029,L223520,u5379,m357,DANCER,S'right.
185030,L223519,u5389,m357,RUSSO,You're in show business.
185031,L223518,u5379,m357,DANCER,"Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business."
185032,L223517,u5389,m357,RUSSO,What's your story?
185033,L223765,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"Yeah, I know."
185034,L223764,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,That's in France.
185035,L223763,u5382,m357,DOYLE,
185036,L223762,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,Marseilles.
185037,L223761,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Where's he from?
185038,L223760,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,I think so.  But they're in Room 408.  On the fourth floor.
185039,L223759,u5382,m357,DOYLE,This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?
185040,L223758,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,"And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does."
185041,L223757,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Yeh?  Who else?
185042,L223756,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,"Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping."
185043,L223755,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,"Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think."
185044,L223754,u5382,m357,DOYLE,What's he do?
185045,L223753,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,Des Moines.
185046,L223752,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Where from?
185047,L223751,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,"A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone."
185048,L223750,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Names.
185049,L223749,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,"There may be two... no, three who could fit it."
185050,L223748,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?"
185051,L223747,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
185052,L223746,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,There's nobody like that on six.
185053,L223744,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.
185054,L223743,u5382,m357,DOYLE,He got off on six.
185055,L223742,u5380,m357,DESK CLERK,"I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean."
185056,L223692,u5387,m357,MUTCHIE,Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
185057,L223691,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Morning.  Sometime.
185058,L223690,u5387,m357,MUTCHIE,When ya go back on?
185059,L223689,u5382,m357,DOYLE,A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
185060,L223688,u5387,m357,MUTCHIE,Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
185061,L223687,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"Strike out, eh?"
185062,L223686,u5387,m357,MUTCHIE,"I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, ""Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."""
185063,L223684,u5387,m357,MUTCHIE,"Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?"
185064,L223683,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Where the hell is it?
185065,L223682,u5387,m357,MUTCHIE,Yeah!
185066,L223681,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?"
185067,L223680,u5387,m357,MUTCHIE,Why not?
185068,L223679,u5382,m357,DOYLE,You want some eggs.
185069,L223678,u5387,m357,MUTCHIE,They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
185070,L223677,u5382,m357,DOYLE,I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
185071,L223676,u5387,m357,MUTCHIE,What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
185072,L223673,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Willie Mays.
185073,L223672,u5387,m357,MUTCHIE,"What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?"
185074,L223901,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Tumble it.  One end to the other.
185075,L223900,u5386,m357,MULDERIG,Nothing in there except a New York street map.
185076,L223899,u5382,m357,DOYLE,A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
185077,L223826,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way."
185078,L223825,u5386,m357,MULDERIG,That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
185079,L223817,u5382,m357,DOYLE,The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
185080,L223816,u5386,m357,MULDERIG,"Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent."
185081,L223777,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week."
185082,L223776,u5386,m357,MULDERIG,Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
185083,L223775,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
185084,L223774,u5386,m357,MULDERIG,"Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit."
185085,L223770,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Who's on him?
185086,L223769,u5386,m357,MULDERIG,Christ you should o' collared him right there.
185087,L223894,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Third time around.

185091,L223829,u5382,m357,DOYLE,This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
185092,L223828,u5389,m357,RUSSO,My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
185093,L223824,u5382,m357,DOYLE,I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
185094,L223823,u5389,m357,RUSSO,"This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop."
185095,L223773,u5389,m357,RUSSO,We put him to bed for the night.
185096,L223772,u5382,m357,DOYLE,What about Sal?
185097,L223768,u5389,m357,RUSSO,The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
185098,L223767,u5382,m357,DOYLE,The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
185099,L223739,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Pour it in your ear.
185100,L223738,u5389,m357,RUSSO,You want the red or the white?
185101,L223723,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
185102,L223722,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?"
185103,L223719,u5389,m357,RUSSO,We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
185104,L223718,u5382,m357,DOYLE,You got the warrant?
185105,L223714,u5382,m357,DOYLE,The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
185106,L223713,u5389,m357,RUSSO,What happened to you?
185107,L223711,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Let yourself in.
185108,L223710,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Why not?
185109,L223709,u5382,m357,DOYLE,I can't.
185110,L223708,u5389,m357,RUSSO,It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
185111,L223707,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Yeah.
185112,L223706,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Popeye.
185113,L223580,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it."
185114,L223579,u5389,m357,RUSSO,We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
185115,L223562,u5382,m357,DOYLE,We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
185116,L223561,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
185117,L223560,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass."
185118,L223500,u5389,m357,RUSSO,"I'm wounded.  Oh, oh."
185119,L223499,u5382,m357,DOYLE,What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
185120,L223491,u5382,m357,DOYLE,He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
185121,L223490,u5389,m357,RUSSO,No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
185122,L223485,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
185123,L223484,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Suspicion of what?
185124,L223483,u5382,m357,DOYLE,I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.

185134,L223423,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Give who a tail?
185135,L223422,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
185136,L223419,u5389,m357,RUSSO,He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.

185149,L223406,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Not a chance.
185150,L223405,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
185151,L223404,u5389,m357,RUSSO,He coulda been white.
185152,L223403,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Never trust a nigger.
185153,L223402,u5389,m357,RUSSO,How'd I know he had a knife.
185154,L223401,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
185155,L223396,u5382,m357,DOYLE,How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
185156,L223395,u5389,m357,RUSSO,Who stuck up the laundromat?
185157,L223661,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
185158,L223660,u5383,m357,JESUS,Forty dollars -- was $250.
185159,L223659,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Pass.
185160,L223658,u5383,m357,JESUS,This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
185161,L223657,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Where'd you get this fag shit?
185162,L223655,u5382,m357,DOYLE,Whatta you got?
185163,L223654,u5383,m357,JESUS,Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
185164,L223653,u5382,m357,DOYLE,"Hiya, Jesus."
185165,L223652,u5383,m357,JESUS,"Hey, Bo."
185166,L223637,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,For dead bodies.
185167,L223636,u5385,m357,MARIE,For garbage?
185168,L223635,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,It was a crematorium.
185169,L223634,u5385,m357,MARIE,What was it?
185170,L223633,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,"Oh, it's been abandoned for years."
185171,L223632,u5385,m357,MARIE,What is that old building?
185172,L223631,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,"I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France."
185173,L223624,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,"The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here."
185174,L223623,u5385,m357,MARIE,Why is it called Hellgate?
185175,L223622,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
185176,L223597,u5385,m357,MARIE,"Darling, may I have this one?"
185177,L223596,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,"No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier."
185178,L223595,u5385,m357,MARIE,Just for mistakes of parking?
185179,L223594,u5384,m357,LA VALLE,"There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month."
185180,L223795,u5391,m357,WEINSTOCK,He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
185181,L223794,u5390,m357,SAL,"I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else."
185182,L223793,u5391,m357,WEINSTOCK,Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
185183,L223792,u5390,m357,SAL,I been damn careful up to now.
185184,L223791,u5391,m357,WEINSTOCK,"So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry."
185185,L223790,u5390,m357,SAL,"Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up."
185186,L223789,u5391,m357,WEINSTOCK,"What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building."
185187,L224560,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!"
185188,L224559,u5392,m358,DARYL,"Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!"
185189,L224556,u5392,m358,DARYL,Nothing.
185190,L224555,u5397,m358,JOHN,"So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?"
185191,L224554,u5392,m358,DARYL,So what?
185192,L224553,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?"
185193,L224552,u5392,m358,DARYL,What I know is what I told you.
185194,L224551,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about."
185195,L224546,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Well, I think you do."
185196,L224545,u5392,m358,DARYL,"No, I don't."
185197,L224544,u5397,m358,JOHN,You know what I'm saying.
185198,L224543,u5392,m358,DARYL,What are you saying?
185199,L224542,u5397,m358,JOHN,You remember Mary Finelli?
185200,L224541,u5392,m358,DARYL,Yeah.
185201,L224540,u5397,m358,JOHN,"You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?"
185202,L224539,u5392,m358,DARYL,That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
185203,L224714,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,I'll go find Hayes.
185204,L224713,u5393,m358,DESK SGT.,"No, I think he's up in interrogation."
185205,L224712,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,"Where's the collar, in the cells?"
185206,L224711,u5393,m358,DESK SGT.,Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
185207,L224710,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,They around?
185208,L224709,u5393,m358,DESK SGT.,That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
185209,L224708,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
185210,L224707,u5393,m358,DESK SGT.,Yeah.
185211,L224706,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
185212,L223971,u5402,m358,SUPERVISOR,There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
185213,L223970,u5394,m358,FRANK,How do we get to the vault door?
185214,L223965,u5402,m358,SUPERVISOR,We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
185215,L223964,u5394,m358,FRANK,"We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now."
185216,L223963,u5402,m358,SUPERVISOR,"Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile."
185217,L223962,u5394,m358,FRANK,You're shitting me!
185218,L223961,u5402,m358,SUPERVISOR,Switches are shorted out.
185219,L223960,u5394,m358,FRANK,Why haven't they killed the juice?
185220,L224277,u5394,m358,FRANK,Elvis has left the building.
185221,L224276,u5395,m358,GIBSON,"You okay, man?"
185222,L224259,u5394,m358,FRANK,Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
185223,L224258,u5395,m358,GIBSON,"Gotta be another way up, Frank."
185224,L224255,u5394,m358,FRANK,One way to find out.
185225,L224254,u5395,m358,GIBSON,Don't know what's behind it.
185226,L224253,u5394,m358,FRANK,It looks open on the other side.
185227,L224233,u5394,m358,FRANK,"I'm alright, Gibby."
185228,L224232,u5395,m358,GIBSON,"Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?"
185229,L223980,u5395,m358,GIBSON,I should'a been a fucking mailman.
185230,L223979,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this."
185231,L223978,u5395,m358,GIBSON,Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
185232,L223954,u5395,m358,GIBSON,"I seem nervous, huh?"
185233,L223953,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do."
185234,L223952,u5395,m358,GIBSON,"Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted."
185235,L223951,u5394,m358,FRANK,"The game, Graham.  The Series?"
185236,L223950,u5395,m358,GIBSON,Baltimore?
185237,L223949,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow."
185238,L224765,u5399,m358,JULIA,Frank...
185239,L224764,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Hey, bud."
185240,L224612,u5394,m358,FRANK,"I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!"
185241,L224611,u5399,m358,JULIA,Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
185242,L224493,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy..."
185243,L224492,u5399,m358,JULIA,The future guy?
185244,L224491,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about."
185245,L224465,u5399,m358,JULIA,So am I.
185246,L224464,u5394,m358,FRANK,I'm serious.
185247,L224463,u5399,m358,JULIA,I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
185248,L224461,u5394,m358,FRANK,"No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future."
185249,L224460,u5399,m358,JULIA,I know.  He loves that thing.
185250,L224459,u5394,m358,FRANK,I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
185251,L224458,u5399,m358,JULIA,"Honey, what is it?  Just tell me."
185252,L224457,u5394,m358,FRANK,"I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he..."
185253,L224456,u5399,m358,JULIA,Okay...
185254,L224455,u5394,m358,FRANK,There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
185255,L224374,u5399,m358,JULIA,Do you know how much I love you?
185256,L224373,u5394,m358,FRANK,Wish you weren't.
185257,L224372,u5399,m358,JULIA,I'm off.
185258,L224371,u5394,m358,FRANK,He ain't the only one.
185259,L224370,u5399,m358,JULIA,Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
185260,L224347,u5399,m358,JULIA,I love you more.
185261,L224346,u5394,m358,FRANK,"I love you, Bud."
185262,L224340,u5399,m358,JULIA,Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
185263,L224339,u5394,m358,FRANK,One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
185264,L224338,u5399,m358,JULIA,You give him his drops?
185265,L224337,u5394,m358,FRANK,I tucked him in at Gordo's.
185266,L224336,u5399,m358,JULIA,Where's Johnny?
185267,L224333,u5394,m358,FRANK,Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
185268,L224332,u5399,m358,JULIA,Frank...what's wrong?
185269,L224098,u5394,m358,FRANK,Sure.
185270,L224097,u5399,m358,JULIA,"Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight."
185271,L224010,u5399,m358,JULIA,"Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there."
185272,L224009,u5394,m358,FRANK,"It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age."
185273,L224008,u5399,m358,JULIA,He did.
185274,L224007,u5394,m358,FRANK,Did he?
185275,L224006,u5399,m358,JULIA,Butch called.
185276,L224005,u5394,m358,FRANK,The usual.
185277,L224004,u5399,m358,JULIA,How was your tour?
185278,L224002,u5394,m358,FRANK,I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
185279,L224001,u5399,m358,JULIA,You didn't marry Donna Reed.
185280,L224000,u5394,m358,FRANK,"What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?"
185281,L223999,u5399,m358,JULIA,I think I ruined the sauce...again.
185282,L223998,u5394,m358,FRANK,You alright?
185283,L223997,u5399,m358,JULIA,Damn.
185284,L223996,u5399,m358,JULIA,"Well, why not a little of the King?"
185285,L223995,u5394,m358,FRANK,How about a little of the King?
185286,L223991,u5399,m358,JULIA,"Hey, bud."
185287,L223990,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Hey, bud."
185288,L224763,u5400,m358,SATCH,Get him home safe.
185289,L224762,u5394,m358,FRANK,Next time lets put some money on it.
185290,L224761,u5400,m358,SATCH,"You missed a hell of a game, Frank."
185291,L224759,u5394,m358,FRANK,No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
185292,L224758,u5400,m358,SATCH,Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
185293,L224757,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Satch, you gotta listen to me..."
185294,L224756,u5400,m358,SATCH,Deleon.
185295,L224700,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?"
185296,L224699,u5394,m358,FRANK,"In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch."
185297,L224698,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Frank, this is insane..."
185298,L224697,u5394,m358,FRANK,"The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park."
185299,L224696,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Frank, please..."
185300,L224695,u5394,m358,FRANK,What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
185301,L224694,u5400,m358,SATCH,How's that?
185302,L224693,u5394,m358,FRANK,"What if I could prove it to you, Satch?"
185303,L224692,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe."
185304,L224691,u5394,m358,FRANK,"He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on..."
185305,L224690,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl."
185306,L224688,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?"
185307,L224687,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Uh, huh."
185308,L224686,u5394,m358,FRANK,"As nuts as that sounds, yes."
185309,L224685,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?"
185310,L224684,u5394,m358,FRANK,"I swear, Satch."
185311,L224674,u5400,m358,SATCH,You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
185312,L224673,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio."
185313,L224672,u5400,m358,SATCH,I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
185314,L224671,u5394,m358,FRANK,No.  This isn't what you think.
185315,L224670,u5400,m358,SATCH,415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
185316,L224669,u5400,m358,SATCH,Do you know where I found this?
185317,L224668,u5394,m358,FRANK,What do you mean?
185318,L224665,u5400,m358,SATCH,Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
185319,L224664,u5394,m358,FRANK,About what?
185320,L224663,u5400,m358,SATCH,Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
185321,L224662,u5394,m358,FRANK,"No, I don't."
185322,L224661,u5400,m358,SATCH,"I think you know, Frank."
185323,L224660,u5394,m358,FRANK,"What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?"
185324,L224657,u5400,m358,SATCH,"I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside."
185325,L224656,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here."
185326,L224655,u5394,m358,FRANK,"John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if..."
185327,L224654,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Frank, we need to talk..."
185328,L224651,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Hello, Frank."
185329,L224650,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Okay, I'm on it.  Hey."
185330,L224102,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Luck, my ass."
185331,L224101,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Lucky throw, fire boy."
185332,L224310,u5398,m358,JOHNNY,I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
185333,L224309,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!"
185334,L224307,u5394,m358,FRANK,I'm right here behind you...
185335,L224306,u5398,m358,JOHNNY,Wait...
185336,L224305,u5394,m358,FRANK,You ready?
185337,L224303,u5394,m358,FRANK,"No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief."
185338,L224302,u5398,m358,JOHNNY,"Daddy, Daddy, I can't."
185339,L224301,u5394,m358,FRANK,Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
185340,L224300,u5398,m358,JOHNNY,I'm scared.
185341,L224143,u5394,m358,FRANK,"I'll be up soon, Little Chief."
185342,L224142,u5398,m358,JOHNNY,"Daddy, come up and sing the baseball."
185343,L224015,u5394,m358,FRANK,"C'mon, Chief, show some guts."
185344,L224014,u5398,m358,JOHNNY,"Daddy, I'm scared."
185345,L224013,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling."
185346,L224012,u5398,m358,JOHNNY,Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
185347,L224011,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Okay, start pedaling."
185348,L223994,u5394,m358,FRANK,Glad to hear that.
185349,L223993,u5398,m358,JOHNNY,"I know.  Sorry, Dad."
185350,L223992,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief."
185351,L224771,u5397,m358,JOHN,I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
185352,L224770,u5394,m358,FRANK,What's wrong?
185353,L224769,u5397,m358,JOHN,Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
185354,L224768,u5394,m358,FRANK,"We did it, John.  We stopped him."
185355,L224767,u5397,m358,JOHN,"I'm here, Dad.  I'm here."
185356,L224678,u5394,m358,FRANK,Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
185357,L224677,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?"
185358,L224676,u5394,m358,FRANK,"John, you there?"
185359,L224659,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away."
185360,L224658,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Dad, what the hell is going on?"
185361,L224653,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Dad, you there?"
185362,L224652,u5394,m358,FRANK,"What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?"
185363,L224648,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale."
185364,L224647,u5394,m358,FRANK,You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
185365,L224614,u5394,m358,FRANK,Hang on.
185366,L224613,u5397,m358,JOHN,"It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him."
185367,L224610,u5394,m358,FRANK,Huh?
185368,L224609,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep."
185369,L224608,u5394,m358,FRANK,I got it.
185370,L224607,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Okay, okay..."
185371,L224606,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Please, Dad, just do it."
185372,L224605,u5394,m358,FRANK,What...
185373,L224604,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners."
185374,L224603,u5394,m358,FRANK,How the hell am I gonna do that?
185375,L224602,u5397,m358,JOHN,His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
185376,L224601,u5394,m358,FRANK,What?
185377,L224600,u5397,m358,JOHN,We got him!  Dad you got him!
185378,L224599,u5394,m358,FRANK,In my pocket.
185379,L224598,u5397,m358,JOHN,He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
185380,L224597,u5394,m358,FRANK,"No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license."
185381,L224596,u5397,m358,JOHN,He took your wallet?
185382,L224595,u5394,m358,FRANK,"He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live."
185383,L224594,u5397,m358,JOHN,What?
185384,L224593,u5394,m358,FRANK,"John, he's got my driver's license."
185385,L224592,u5397,m358,JOHN,I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
185386,L224591,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Johnny, I know, but..."
185387,L224590,u5397,m358,JOHN,"But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?"
185388,L224589,u5394,m358,FRANK,I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
185389,L224588,u5397,m358,JOHN,"I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right."
185390,L224587,u5394,m358,FRANK,This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
185391,L224586,u5397,m358,JOHN,No.
185392,L224585,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse."
185393,L224584,u5397,m358,JOHN,"It's not your fault, Dad."
185394,L224583,u5394,m358,FRANK,He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
185395,L224520,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what."
185396,L224519,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Yeah, I think so..."
185397,L224518,u5394,m358,FRANK,You all right?
185398,L224517,u5397,m358,JOHN,"I'm right here, Dad."
185399,L224516,u5394,m358,FRANK,"John, you still there?"
185400,L224495,u5397,m358,JOHN,H-hi.
185401,L224494,u5394,m358,FRANK,"John, say hello to my wife...Julia."
185402,L224490,u5397,m358,JOHN,You there?
185403,L224489,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Hang on a sec, John."
185404,L224488,u5394,m358,FRANK,Wow.
185405,L224487,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop."
185406,L224486,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Yeah, you betcha."
185407,L224485,u5397,m358,JOHN,You really wanna know?
185408,L224484,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?"
185409,L224483,u5397,m358,JOHN,"We're okay...we're good, Dad."
185410,L224482,u5394,m358,FRANK,What are we like in...1998?
185411,L224481,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here."
185412,L224480,u5394,m358,FRANK,"What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?"
185413,L224479,u5397,m358,JOHN,Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
185414,L224478,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future."
185415,L224477,u5394,m358,FRANK,"All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing."
185416,L224476,u5397,m358,JOHN,Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
185417,L224475,u5394,m358,FRANK,How?
185418,L224474,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard."
185419,L224473,u5394,m358,FRANK,Got it.
185420,L224472,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five."
185421,L224471,u5394,m358,FRANK,Whatta we do now?
185422,L224470,u5397,m358,JOHN,It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
185423,L224469,u5394,m358,FRANK,No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
185424,L224468,u5397,m358,JOHN,Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
185425,L224467,u5394,m358,FRANK,I'll be damned.
185426,L224423,u5397,m358,JOHN,Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
185427,L224422,u5394,m358,FRANK,What do I tell them?
185428,L224421,u5397,m358,JOHN,"They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops."
185429,L224420,u5394,m358,FRANK,Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
185430,L224417,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives."
185431,L224416,u5394,m358,FRANK,"What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?"
185432,L224415,u5397,m358,JOHN,"You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same."
185433,L224414,u5397,m358,JOHN,I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
185434,L224413,u5394,m358,FRANK,"I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different."
185435,L224412,u5397,m358,JOHN,"They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment."
185436,L224411,u5394,m358,FRANK,So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
185437,L224410,u5397,m358,JOHN,"No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it."
185438,L224409,u5394,m358,FRANK,What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
185439,L224408,u5397,m358,JOHN,That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
185440,L224407,u5394,m358,FRANK,I'll warn them.
185441,L224406,u5397,m358,JOHN,I don't know...  What about the other women?
185442,L224405,u5394,m358,FRANK,"I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away."
185443,L224404,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women."
185444,L224403,u5394,m358,FRANK,What are you talking about?
185445,L224402,u5397,m358,JOHN,He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
185446,L224401,u5394,m358,FRANK,Whatta you mean...
185447,L224400,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse."
185448,L224399,u5394,m358,FRANK,What kinda twisted animal.
185449,L224398,u5397,m358,JOHN,"There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped."
185450,L224397,u5394,m358,FRANK,Murdered?  Why?
185451,L224394,u5394,m358,FRANK,Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
185452,L224393,u5397,m358,JOHN,"October 22, 1969."
185453,L224392,u5394,m358,FRANK,When?
185454,L224391,u5397,m358,JOHN,"No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me."
185455,L224390,u5394,m358,FRANK,"She just died, your mother just died?"
185456,L224389,u5397,m358,JOHN,She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
185457,L224388,u5394,m358,FRANK,Whatta you mean she's not here?
185458,L224387,u5397,m358,JOHN,She's not here.
185459,L224386,u5394,m358,FRANK,What?  What is it?
185460,L224385,u5397,m358,JOHN,It's Mom.
185461,L224384,u5394,m358,FRANK,"What?  Johnny, what's wrong?"
185462,L224383,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Something happened, something..."
185463,L224382,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Are you alright""?"
185464,L224381,u5397,m358,JOHN,Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
185465,L224380,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out."
185466,L224326,u5397,m358,JOHN,What it was like when you died in the fire...
185467,L224325,u5394,m358,FRANK,"What, Johnny?  What is it?"
185468,L224324,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember."
185469,L224323,u5394,m358,FRANK,I'm glad.
185470,L224322,u5397,m358,JOHN,It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
185471,L224321,u5394,m358,FRANK,Tell me.
185472,L224320,u5397,m358,JOHN,"We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good."
185473,L224319,u5394,m358,FRANK,Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
185474,L224318,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Dad, you there?  You okay?"
185475,L224317,u5394,m358,FRANK,"You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it."
185476,L224316,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Yeah, it's me."
185477,L224315,u5394,m358,FRANK,Chief?!  Is that you?
185478,L224314,u5397,m358,JOHN,Dad...?
185479,L224221,u5394,m358,FRANK,I don't understand.
185480,L224220,u5397,m358,JOHN,Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
185481,L224219,u5397,m358,JOHN,Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
185482,L224218,u5394,m358,FRANK,But that's tomorrow.
185483,L224217,u5397,m358,JOHN,"October 12, 1969."
185484,L224216,u5394,m358,FRANK,When?
185485,L224215,u5397,m358,JOHN,"It did, Pop.  It did."
185486,L224214,u5394,m358,FRANK,That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
185487,L224213,u5397,m358,JOHN,"It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it."
185488,L224212,u5394,m358,FRANK,On the job?
185489,L224211,u5397,m358,JOHN,Fire.
185490,L224210,u5394,m358,FRANK,Why?
185491,L224209,u5397,m358,JOHN,"I never knew you, Dad."
185492,L224208,u5394,m358,FRANK,What?
185493,L224207,u5397,m358,JOHN,I lost you.
185494,L224206,u5394,m358,FRANK,What are you talking about?
185495,L224205,u5397,m358,JOHN,But you're not...you're not still here.
185496,L224204,u5394,m358,FRANK,"It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief."
185497,L224203,u5397,m358,JOHN,"No wait, don't go!"
185498,L224202,u5394,m358,FRANK,I think I'm losing you.
185499,L224201,u5397,m358,JOHN,What's that?
185500,L224200,u5397,m358,JOHN,"I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much."
185501,L224199,u5394,m358,FRANK,"You're still my Little Chief, right?"
185502,L224197,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Nah, I gave it up."
185503,L224196,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Too busy playin' ball, huh?"
185504,L224195,u5397,m358,JOHN,"No, not yet."
185505,L224193,u5397,m358,JOHN,Yeah...I think so.
185506,L224192,u5394,m358,FRANK,"It's really you, isn't it?"
185507,L224191,u5397,m358,JOHN,"I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I""m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998."
185508,L224190,u5394,m358,FRANK,1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
185509,L224189,u5397,m358,JOHN,1998.
185510,L224188,u5394,m358,FRANK,Thirty-five?  That would make it...
185511,L224187,u5397,m358,JOHN,I'm thirty-five years old.
185512,L224186,u5394,m358,FRANK,You sound...ground up...?
185513,L224185,u5397,m358,JOHN,Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
185514,L224184,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Yeah, that's how Hams work."
185515,L224183,u5397,m358,JOHN,Sun spot?
185516,L224182,u5394,m358,FRANK,We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
185517,L224181,u5397,m358,JOHN,I don't know.
185518,L224180,u5394,m358,FRANK,How could this be happening?
185519,L224179,u5394,m358,FRANK,Johnny...?
185520,L224178,u5397,m358,JOHN,Dad...?
185521,L224177,u5397,m358,JOHN,What if it's not...
185522,L224176,u5394,m358,FRANK,That's impossible.
185523,L224174,u5394,m358,FRANK,What's happening?
185524,L224173,u5397,m358,JOHN,You just burned the desk.
185525,L224172,u5394,m358,FRANK,What?
185526,L224171,u5397,m358,JOHN,Oh my god.
185527,L224170,u5394,m358,FRANK,Nothing...I just spilled something.
185528,L224169,u5397,m358,JOHN,What's going on?
185529,L224166,u5394,m358,FRANK,I'm not dreaming.
185530,L224165,u5397,m358,JOHN,"I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream."
185531,L224164,u5394,m358,FRANK,What the hell...
185532,L224163,u5397,m358,JOHN,"My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd..."
185533,L224162,u5394,m358,FRANK,29 years...?
185534,L224161,u5397,m358,JOHN,29-years ago.
185535,L224160,u5394,m358,FRANK,What?
185536,L224159,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father..."
185537,L224158,u5394,m358,FRANK,W...B...2...YXB.
185538,L224157,u5397,m358,JOHN,"What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?"
185539,L224156,u5394,m358,FRANK,What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
185540,L224155,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Gordo, if this is you, so help me..."
185541,L224154,u5394,m358,FRANK,Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
185542,L224153,u5397,m358,JOHN,"You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?"
185543,L224152,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Look pal, I'm just askin' how you..."
185544,L224151,u5397,m358,JOHN,Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
185545,L224150,u5394,m358,FRANK,Frank...Frank Sullivan.
185546,L224149,u5397,m358,JOHN,What'd you say your name was?
185547,L224148,u5394,m358,FRANK,Uh huh...
185548,L224147,u5397,m358,JOHN,You call your son Little Chief?
185549,L224146,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Oh, that was my kid."
185550,L224145,u5397,m358,JOHN,What'd you just say?
185551,L224144,u5394,m358,FRANK,Sorry 'bout that.
185552,L224141,u5397,m358,JOHN,This afternoon?
185553,L224140,u5394,m358,FRANK,What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
185554,L224139,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago."
185555,L224138,u5394,m358,FRANK,The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
185556,L224137,u5397,m358,JOHN,Huh?
185557,L224136,u5394,m358,FRANK,I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
185558,L224135,u5397,m358,JOHN,Hello?
185559,L224134,u5394,m358,FRANK,"...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15."
185560,L224092,u5397,m358,JOHN,Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
185561,L224091,u5394,m358,FRANK,"I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?"
185562,L224088,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball."
185563,L224087,u5397,m358,JOHN,I got fed up with all the bullshit.
185564,L224086,u5394,m358,FRANK,What?
185565,L224085,u5397,m358,JOHN,I don't really follow baseball anymore.
185566,L224084,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?"
185567,L224082,u5397,m358,JOHN,I can't believe people are still using these things.
185568,L224081,u5394,m358,FRANK,15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
185569,L224080,u5397,m358,JOHN,I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
185570,L224079,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised."
185571,L224078,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Queens, New York."
185572,L224077,u5394,m358,FRANK,Where are you transmitting from?
185573,L224076,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Pal, my whole life's an emergency."
185574,L224075,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band."
185575,L224074,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Look, I don't really remember how this thing works."
185576,L224073,u5394,m358,FRANK,"Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?"
185577,L224072,u5397,m358,JOHN,Name's John.
185578,L224071,u5394,m358,FRANK,"WB2YKXB, who've I got?"
185579,L224070,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Uh, hello?"
185580,L224515,u5396,m358,GORDO,"You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa."
185581,L224514,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it."
185582,L224513,u5396,m358,GORDO,I better give you my address then.
185583,L224511,u5396,m358,GORDO,"How'd you know my name, mister?"
185584,L224510,u5397,m358,JOHN,Gordo?
185585,L224509,u5396,m358,GORDO,This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
185586,L224294,u5397,m358,JOHN,The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
185587,L224293,u5396,m358,GORDO,Huh?
185588,L224290,u5396,m358,GORDO,"Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago."
185589,L224289,u5397,m358,JOHN,Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
185590,L224288,u5396,m358,GORDO,"Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John."
185591,L224287,u5397,m358,JOHN,My father didn't die in a fire?
185592,L224286,u5396,m358,GORDO,Huh?
185593,L224285,u5397,m358,JOHN,My father didn't die in a fire?
185594,L224281,u5396,m358,GORDO,What?
185595,L224280,u5397,m358,JOHN,Longbranch...?
185596,L224279,u5396,m358,GORDO,"John.  John, you all right?"
185597,L224235,u5397,m358,JOHN,Better.
185598,L224234,u5396,m358,GORDO,How you feeling?
185599,L224228,u5396,m358,GORDO,I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
185600,L224227,u5397,m358,JOHN,The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
185601,L224226,u5396,m358,GORDO,Go in where?
185602,L224225,u5397,m358,JOHN,"No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in."
185603,L224224,u5396,m358,GORDO,"C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo."
185604,L224223,u5397,m358,JOHN,I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
185605,L224222,u5396,m358,GORDO,Sull!  What the hell!
185606,L224039,u5397,m358,JOHN,I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
185607,L224038,u5396,m358,GORDO,"Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?"
185608,L224034,u5397,m358,JOHN,What the hell is that smell?
185609,L224033,u5396,m358,GORDO,"Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again."
185610,L224032,u5396,m358,GORDO,Sully!  Is that you?
185611,L224031,u5397,m358,JOHN,"I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?"
185612,L224573,u5397,m358,JOHN,Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
185613,L224572,u5400,m358,SATCH,"He ain't our guy, John."
185614,L224571,u5397,m358,JOHN,Yeah.  Sure.
185615,L224570,u5400,m358,SATCH,Got a minute?
185616,L224538,u5400,m358,SATCH,"I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy."
185617,L224537,u5397,m358,JOHN,What?
185618,L224536,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Uh, huh."
185619,L224535,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch."
185620,L224534,u5400,m358,SATCH,"So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?"
185621,L224533,u5397,m358,JOHN,"I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder."
185622,L224530,u5400,m358,SATCH,Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
185623,L224529,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Okay, lemme walk you through it."
185624,L224451,u5400,m358,SATCH,This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
185625,L224450,u5397,m358,JOHN,Which means he probably knew her.
185626,L224449,u5400,m358,SATCH,April 16...?  That means she was the first.
185627,L224448,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968."
185628,L224431,u5400,m358,SATCH,"That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job."
185629,L224430,u5397,m358,JOHN,"That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break."
185630,L224366,u5400,m358,SATCH,"What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times."
185631,L224365,u5397,m358,JOHN,Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
185632,L224364,u5400,m358,SATCH,She makes ten.
185633,L224361,u5400,m358,SATCH,And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
185634,L224360,u5397,m358,JOHN,I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
185635,L224359,u5400,m358,SATCH,"This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it..."
185636,L224357,u5397,m358,JOHN,Yeah.  That's it.
185637,L224356,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Another rough night, huh?  That it?"
185638,L224292,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real."
185639,L224291,u5400,m358,SATCH,Maybe you outta lay off a little...
185640,L224283,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Whoa, I just...I just..."
185641,L224282,u5400,m358,SATCH,You're not looking too good.
185642,L224106,u5400,m358,SATCH,Nothing you're willing to do.
185643,L224105,u5397,m358,JOHN,She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
185644,L224104,u5400,m358,SATCH,"Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that."
185645,L224506,u5399,m358,JULIA,"I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart."
185646,L224505,u5397,m358,JOHN,Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
185647,L224504,u5399,m358,JULIA,"Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?"
185648,L224503,u5397,m358,JOHN,I try to be.
185649,L224502,u5399,m358,JULIA,"Are you a good cop, John?"
185650,L224501,u5397,m358,JOHN,She's pretty special.
185651,L224500,u5399,m358,JULIA,You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
185652,L224499,u5397,m358,JOHN,Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
185653,L224498,u5399,m358,JULIA,My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
185654,L224497,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Yeah, that's right."
185655,L224496,u5399,m358,JULIA,"Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?"
185656,L224130,u5397,m358,JOHN,Look who's talking.
185657,L224129,u5399,m358,JULIA,"You work too hard, John."
185658,L224128,u5397,m358,JOHN,I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
185659,L224127,u5399,m358,JULIA,"Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone."
185660,L224126,u5397,m358,JOHN,So how'd you like LION KING?
185661,L224125,u5399,m358,JULIA,Close.
185662,L224124,u5397,m358,JOHN,"No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!"
185663,L224123,u5399,m358,JULIA,Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
185664,L224122,u5397,m358,JOHN,So how are things at the hospital?
185665,L224121,u5399,m358,JULIA,I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
185666,L224120,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy."
185667,L224119,u5399,m358,JULIA,I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
185668,L224118,u5397,m358,JOHN,Sounds good.
185669,L224117,u5399,m358,JULIA,I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
185670,L224064,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you."
185671,L224063,u5399,m358,JULIA,"Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone."
185672,L224752,u5397,m358,JOHN,"It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon."
185673,L224751,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,"Fuck you, asshole."
185674,L224750,u5397,m358,JOHN,You have the right to speak to an att --
185675,L224749,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,Sullivan?
185676,L224748,u5397,m358,JOHN,Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
185677,L224747,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,Who the fuck is this?
185678,L224746,u5397,m358,JOHN,You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
185679,L224745,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,Hell-
185680,L224646,u5397,m358,JOHN,I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
185681,L224645,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,Who are you?
185682,L224643,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking."
185683,L224642,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,Huh.
185684,L224641,u5397,m358,JOHN,"No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli."
185685,L224640,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,No kiddin'?
185686,L224639,u5397,m358,JOHN,"As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders."
185687,L224638,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,I hear that.
185688,L224637,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Nah, just working the job."
185689,L224636,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,"A hot shot, huh?"
185690,L224635,u5397,m358,JOHN,The 2-3.  Homicide.
185691,L224634,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,No.  What house you work?
185692,L224633,u5397,m358,JOHN,I look familiar?
185693,L224632,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,"Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?"
185694,L224631,u5397,m358,JOHN,You used to be on the job?
185695,L224626,u5397,m358,JOHN,Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
185696,L224625,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,"No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years."
185697,L224624,u5397,m358,JOHN,Wife around?
185698,L224623,u5401,m358,SHEPARD,Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
185699,L224622,u5397,m358,JOHN,"Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say ""hello."""
185700,L225816,u5403,m359,ABEL,"""He"" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!"
185701,L225815,u5410,m359,SHELLY,"That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!"
185702,L225814,u5403,m359,ABEL,"I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe ""he"" wanted me to have this..."
185703,L225813,u5410,m359,SHELLY,What is that?
185704,L225811,u5403,m359,ABEL,Drop me off?  How do you mean?
185705,L225810,u5410,m359,SHELLY,"I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?"
185706,L225809,u5403,m359,ABEL,Going?  How do you mean?
185707,L225808,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Where are you going?
185708,L225807,u5403,m359,ABEL,My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
185709,L226011,u5410,m359,SHELLY,"Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding."
185710,L226010,u5404,m359,ANDY,You're all just jealous.
185711,L226007,u5404,m359,ANDY,I did?!  I broke the world's record.
185712,L226006,u5410,m359,SHELLY,"According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago."
185713,L226005,u5404,m359,ANDY,... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
185714,L225988,u5410,m359,SHELLY,We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
185715,L225987,u5404,m359,ANDY,Who brought up this bright idea?
185716,L225877,u5404,m359,ANDY,"Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!"
185717,L225876,u5410,m359,SHELLY,No more... I can't!
185718,L225744,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
185719,L225743,u5404,m359,ANDY,"Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself."
185720,L225742,u5404,m359,ANDY,Same thing.
185721,L225741,u5410,m359,SHELLY,"I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor."
185722,L225740,u5404,m359,ANDY,Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
185723,L226063,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,Sure.
185724,L226062,u5404,m359,ANDY,Do you want a beer or not?
185725,L226060,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,What?
185726,L226059,u5404,m359,ANDY,I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
185727,L226058,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,Barely.
185728,L226057,u5404,m359,ANDY,Hey Deb... can you hear me?
185729,L226056,u5404,m359,ANDY,You're too clean for me.
185730,L226055,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,"I think it's called ""a shower"". You might try it sometime."
185731,L226054,u5404,m359,ANDY,What're you doin'?
185732,L226052,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,I vote for the hammock.
185733,L226051,u5404,m359,ANDY,I vote for me.
185734,L226050,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
185735,L226024,u5404,m359,ANDY,I'll think of something.
185736,L226023,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,Think you can figure it out?
185737,L226022,u5404,m359,ANDY,"I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?"
185738,L226021,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,"First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you..."
185739,L226020,u5404,m359,ANDY,How do we do it?
185740,L225990,u5404,m359,ANDY,If you insist.
185741,L225989,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
185742,L225982,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,"You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house."
185743,L225981,u5404,m359,ANDY,How about a roll in the hay?
185744,L225980,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,Not now.  I'm cold.
185745,L225979,u5404,m359,ANDY,"We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look."
185746,L225978,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,What're you doing?
185747,L225959,u5404,m359,ANDY,Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
185748,L225958,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
185749,L225957,u5404,m359,ANDY,I don't know...
185750,L225956,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,Why don't we go take a swim?
185751,L225881,u5404,m359,ANDY,Where's Shelly?
185752,L225880,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,What was that?
185753,L225785,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
185754,L225784,u5404,m359,ANDY,Breakfast?
185755,L225734,u5404,m359,ANDY,I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
185756,L225733,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,"Cool it, Andy."
185757,L225732,u5404,m359,ANDY,So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
185758,L225728,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
185759,L225727,u5404,m359,ANDY,What're you gonna do?
185760,L226090,u5405,m359,CHILI,"Be a man, man."
185761,L226089,u5407,m359,CHUCK,Will you come with me?
185762,L226088,u5405,m359,CHILI,Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
185763,L226087,u5407,m359,CHUCK,Don't do that to me!
185764,L226086,u5405,m359,CHILI,Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
185765,L226085,u5407,m359,CHUCK,What's the matter?!
185766,L226084,u5405,m359,CHILI,It's Friday the 13th.
185767,L226083,u5407,m359,CHUCK,"I can't even remember what day it is, man."
185768,L226082,u5405,m359,CHILI,I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
185769,L225944,u5405,m359,CHILI,This is all the exercise I need...
185770,L225943,u5407,m359,CHUCK,Maybe we should do some exercise.
185771,L225851,u5407,m359,CHUCK,"And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either."
185772,L225850,u5405,m359,CHILI,"That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark."
185773,L225849,u5407,m359,CHUCK,It's dark down there.
185774,L225798,u5407,m359,CHUCK,"I love you, man!"
185775,L225797,u5405,m359,CHILI,I'm a slow eater.
185776,L225795,u5405,m359,CHILI,Chuck... look.
185777,L225794,u5407,m359,CHUCK,"I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!"
185778,L225779,u5405,m359,CHILI,"Yes, man!"
185779,L225778,u5407,m359,CHUCK,"Destroy the evidence?  No, man!"
185780,L225863,u5406,m359,CHRIS,Have you ever made love in a hammock?
185781,L225862,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,A hammock?
185782,L225861,u5406,m359,CHRIS,Your bed.
185783,L225860,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,What's this?
185784,L225825,u5406,m359,CHRIS,You go ahead...
185785,L225824,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,Come on down!
185786,L225749,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
185787,L225748,u5406,m359,CHRIS,What are they saying?
185788,L225738,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,"Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?"
185789,L225737,u5406,m359,CHRIS,"I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't."
185790,L225724,u5406,m359,CHRIS,It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
185791,L225723,u5408,m359,DEBBIE,Which one is it?
185792,L226074,u5406,m359,CHRIS,Sort of.
185793,L226073,u5409,m359,DEREK,You know him?
185794,L226071,u5409,m359,DEREK,"Sure, just watch where you're going."
185795,L226070,u5406,m359,CHRIS,Could we move a little faster?
185796,L226027,u5409,m359,DEREK,"It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you."
185797,L226026,u5406,m359,CHRIS,"When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please..."
185798,L226004,u5409,m359,DEREK,"After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?"
185799,L226003,u5406,m359,CHRIS,You promised you'd never ask me.
185800,L226002,u5409,m359,DEREK,What happened that night?
185801,L226001,u5406,m359,CHRIS,I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
185802,L226000,u5409,m359,DEREK,"I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?"
185803,L225999,u5406,m359,CHRIS,I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
185804,L225998,u5409,m359,DEREK,"And, what about us?"
185805,L225997,u5406,m359,CHRIS,... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
185806,L225996,u5409,m359,DEREK,Why did you come back here?
185807,L225995,u5406,m359,CHRIS,The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
185808,L225994,u5409,m359,DEREK,What do you mean?
185809,L225993,u5406,m359,CHRIS,It's deceiving.
185810,L225992,u5409,m359,DEREK,"You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet."
185811,L225954,u5406,m359,CHRIS,Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
185812,L225953,u5409,m359,DEREK,This is too painful to look at.
185813,L225887,u5406,m359,CHRIS,No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
185814,L225886,u5409,m359,DEREK,"Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me."
185815,L225885,u5406,m359,CHRIS,"Are you all right, Shelly?"
185816,L225884,u5409,m359,DEREK,Shelly!  Where are you?!
185817,L225872,u5406,m359,CHRIS,I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
185818,L225871,u5409,m359,DEREK,Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
185819,L225870,u5406,m359,CHRIS,Somebody was in here.
185820,L225869,u5409,m359,DEREK,No.  I got here just before you did.
185821,L225868,u5406,m359,CHRIS,Did you stay here last night?
185822,L225867,u5409,m359,DEREK,Look what I found.  Remember these?
185823,L225845,u5406,m359,CHRIS,Nothing.
185824,L225844,u5409,m359,DEREK,What?
185825,L225843,u5406,m359,CHRIS,"This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?"
185826,L225840,u5409,m359,DEREK,Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
185827,L225839,u5406,m359,CHRIS,Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
185828,L225838,u5409,m359,DEREK,You're irresistible.  I lose control.
185829,L225837,u5406,m359,CHRIS,I don't know.
185830,L225836,u5409,m359,DEREK,Is that so bad?
185831,L225835,u5406,m359,CHRIS,"You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you."
185832,L225834,u5409,m359,DEREK,Hello.  How are you?
185833,L225833,u5406,m359,CHRIS,"You can say... ""Hello, how are you?""... for starters."
185834,L225832,u5409,m359,DEREK,I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
185835,L225831,u5406,m359,CHRIS,You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
185836,L225830,u5409,m359,DEREK,Why?
185837,L225829,u5406,m359,CHRIS,Derek... stop.
185838,L226042,u5411,m359,VERA,You're wrong.
185839,L226041,u5410,m359,SHELLY,You don't to say it.  I can tell.
185840,L226040,u5411,m359,VERA,"I never said you were ""nothing""."
185841,L226039,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
185842,L226038,u5411,m359,VERA,I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
185843,L226037,u5410,m359,SHELLY,I just want you to like me.
185844,L226036,u5411,m359,VERA,"You don't ""have to."""
185845,L226035,u5410,m359,SHELLY,I have to.
185846,L226034,u5411,m359,VERA,Why do you do these stupid things?!
185847,L226033,u5411,m359,VERA,"Damn you, Shelly!"
185848,L226032,u5410,m359,SHELLY,You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
185849,L226018,u5411,m359,VERA,Don't say any more.
185850,L226017,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
185851,L225952,u5410,m359,SHELLY,A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
185852,L225951,u5411,m359,VERA,"We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault."
185853,L225949,u5410,m359,SHELLY,It was nothing.
185854,L225948,u5411,m359,VERA,We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
185855,L225942,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
185856,L225941,u5411,m359,VERA,This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
185857,L225940,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Stop the car!  Now!!
185858,L225939,u5411,m359,VERA,Bullseye!
185859,L225938,u5411,m359,VERA,You're the boss.
185860,L225937,u5410,m359,SHELLY,"No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell ""stop,"" you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?"
185861,L225936,u5411,m359,VERA,What're you doing?
185862,L225935,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Just keep your eyes on the road.
185863,L225934,u5411,m359,VERA,This is no time to celebrate!
185864,L225933,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Maybe.
185865,L225932,u5411,m359,VERA,Got any good ideas?
185866,L225928,u5411,m359,VERA,Keep looking.
185867,L225927,u5410,m359,SHELLY,I don't see anything.
185868,L225925,u5411,m359,VERA,Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
185869,L225924,u5410,m359,SHELLY,"Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that ""next time"" isn't too soon."
185870,L225923,u5411,m359,VERA,See anything?
185871,L225920,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Gulp!
185872,L225919,u5411,m359,VERA,Yes.
185873,L225918,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Are they following us?
185874,L225914,u5411,m359,VERA,May be please have the wallet.
185875,L225913,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Please... be cool.
185876,L225906,u5410,m359,SHELLY,"Excuse me, but I believe that's mine..."
185877,L225905,u5411,m359,VERA,Everything's gonna be fine.
185878,L225904,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Is... is everything all right?
185879,L225804,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Not us!  He's really creepy.
185880,L225803,u5411,m359,VERA,"Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?"
185881,L225802,u5410,m359,SHELLY,That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
185882,L225789,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
185883,L225788,u5411,m359,VERA,Why don't you help us?
185884,L225787,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Faster!  Eat faster!
185885,L225777,u5411,m359,VERA,"Destroy the evidence, Pronto!"
185886,L225776,u5410,m359,SHELLY,What are we gonna do?
185887,L225773,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Stick around and you'll see.
185888,L225772,u5411,m359,VERA,In that little thing?
185889,L225771,u5410,m359,SHELLY,My whole world.
185890,L225770,u5411,m359,VERA,What d'ya got in there?
185891,L225755,u5410,m359,SHELLY,I'm sorry.
185892,L225754,u5411,m359,VERA,You're Shelly?
185893,L225753,u5410,m359,SHELLY,Hi.
185894,L226327,u5412,m360,CORT,No way...  ...I wanna rock!
185895,L226326,u5415,m360,JILL,That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
185896,L226318,u5412,m360,CORT,"Alright, alright."
185897,L226317,u5415,m360,JILL,Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
185898,L226315,u5412,m360,CORT,What?  Who pulled it out?!
185899,L226314,u5415,m360,JILL,Go out and plug the cord back in.
185900,L226313,u5412,m360,CORT,What?
185901,L226311,u5415,m360,JILL,My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
185902,L226310,u5412,m360,CORT,Who's Horace?
185903,L226309,u5415,m360,JILL,"If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt."
185904,L226308,u5415,m360,JILL,Great.  Just great.
185905,L226307,u5412,m360,CORT,I thought that was the end of the song.
185906,L226165,u5418,m360,LIZBETH,Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
185907,L226164,u5413,m360,DARREN,Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
185908,L226161,u5418,m360,LIZBETH,That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
185909,L226160,u5413,m360,DARREN,"Oh, jeez."
185910,L226158,u5413,m360,DARREN,Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
185911,L226157,u5418,m360,LIZBETH,That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
185912,L226156,u5413,m360,DARREN,That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
185913,L226155,u5418,m360,LIZBETH,We're gonna scare him?!
185914,L226154,u5413,m360,DARREN,Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
185915,L226150,u5418,m360,LIZBETH,Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
185916,L226149,u5413,m360,DARREN,Why?
185917,L226148,u5418,m360,LIZBETH,"Darren, we better turn around."
185918,L226145,u5418,m360,LIZBETH,I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
185919,L226144,u5413,m360,DARREN,"You admit the sign did say ""Camp Forest Green,"" with an arrow pointing this way."
185920,L226143,u5418,m360,LIZBETH,"Well, who told me to take this cow path?"
185921,L226142,u5413,m360,DARREN,Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
185922,L226431,u5414,m360,DEPUTY,"Sheriff, you better take this."
185923,L226430,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll..."
185924,L226370,u5414,m360,DEPUTY,Happy Friday the 13th.
185925,L226369,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,Whaddya mean?
185926,L226368,u5414,m360,DEPUTY,He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
185927,L226367,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
185928,L226366,u5414,m360,DEPUTY,I wish it was.
185929,L226365,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,Is that all you found?
185930,L226244,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,Better call an ambulance first.
185931,L226243,u5414,m360,DEPUTY,Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
185932,L226242,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
185933,L226231,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
185934,L226230,u5414,m360,DEPUTY,"He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?"
185935,L226229,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
185936,L226239,u5416,m360,KATIE,I could swear I heard...
185937,L226238,u5424,m360,STAN,"Ahh, nothing."
185938,L226235,u5424,m360,STAN,"Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over."
185939,L226234,u5416,m360,KATIE,"Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost."
185940,L226233,u5424,m360,STAN,You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
185941,L226232,u5416,m360,KATIE,"Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!"
185942,L226204,u5416,m360,KATIE,"See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine."
185943,L226203,u5424,m360,STAN,Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
185944,L226202,u5416,m360,KATIE,....with a woman's touch.
185945,L226206,u5424,m360,STAN,"It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec."
185946,L226205,u5417,m360,LARRY,Never should've let her play.
185947,L226201,u5424,m360,STAN,This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
185948,L226200,u5417,m360,LARRY,"You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it."
185949,L226199,u5424,m360,STAN,"Yeah, that's fat too."
185950,L226198,u5417,m360,LARRY,My ass.
185951,L226197,u5424,m360,STAN,"That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win."
185952,L226196,u5417,m360,LARRY,This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
185953,L226195,u5424,m360,STAN,"Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours."
185954,L226440,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that..."
185955,L226439,u5419,m360,MEGAN,"No.  No, it's not..."
185956,L226436,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
185957,L226435,u5419,m360,MEGAN,"Daddy, what is going on?"
185958,L226434,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
185959,L226427,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
185960,L226426,u5419,m360,MEGAN,Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
185961,L226423,u5419,m360,MEGAN,All he's asking is for you to check it out.
185962,L226422,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"...And I said, shut up!"
185963,L226349,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
185964,L226348,u5419,m360,MEGAN,I thought Jason was only a legend?
185965,L226347,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
185966,L226346,u5419,m360,MEGAN,What it is?
185967,L226337,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady."
185968,L226336,u5419,m360,MEGAN,How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
185969,L226335,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
185970,L226334,u5419,m360,MEGAN,When are you going to stop treating me like one!
185971,L226189,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors."
185972,L226188,u5419,m360,MEGAN,"But, Dad, we..."
185973,L226182,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous."
185974,L226181,u5419,m360,MEGAN,Jason who?
185975,L226173,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble."
185976,L226172,u5419,m360,MEGAN,"Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them."
185977,L226524,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks."
185978,L226523,u5419,m360,MEGAN,Did you hear me?!
185979,L226522,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks."
185980,L226504,u5425,m360,TOMMY,I hope so.
185981,L226503,u5419,m360,MEGAN,They did show up.  Isn't that great?
185982,L226492,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
185983,L226491,u5419,m360,MEGAN,Lake Forest Green?
185984,L226490,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957."
185985,L226489,u5419,m360,MEGAN,"Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?"
185986,L226478,u5425,m360,TOMMY,I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
185987,L226477,u5419,m360,MEGAN,Wait a minute. I just...
185988,L226476,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"Sorry, Megan.  Not this time."
185989,L226464,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Come and get it.
185990,L226463,u5419,m360,MEGAN,"Okay, give it back."
185991,L226462,u5425,m360,TOMMY,'Cause it stinks.
185992,L226461,u5419,m360,MEGAN,Why?
185993,L226460,u5425,m360,TOMMY,No.
185994,L226459,u5419,m360,MEGAN,There...Ya happy?
185995,L226456,u5419,m360,MEGAN,What's it to ya?
185996,L226455,u5425,m360,TOMMY,So what are ya drawin'?
185997,L226405,u5425,m360,TOMMY,It's just beginning.
185998,L226404,u5419,m360,MEGAN,It's all over.
185999,L226387,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Okay.  There's one.
186000,L226386,u5419,m360,MEGAN,You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
186001,L226383,u5419,m360,MEGAN,Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
186002,L226382,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Uh...yes.  But...
186003,L226381,u5419,m360,MEGAN,Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
186004,L226379,u5419,m360,MEGAN,Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
186005,L226378,u5425,m360,TOMMY,What?
186006,L226354,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until..."
186007,L226353,u5419,m360,MEGAN,"Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll..."
186008,L226352,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to..."
186009,L226450,u5421,m360,PAULA,Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
186010,L226449,u5420,m360,NANCY,But what I get scared again?
186011,L226448,u5421,m360,PAULA,I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
186012,L226420,u5421,m360,PAULA,We'll scare 'em right back.
186013,L226419,u5420,m360,NANCY,But what if they try and scare us?
186014,L226417,u5420,m360,NANCY,Who ya calling?
186015,L226416,u5421,m360,PAULA,I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
186016,L226414,u5420,m360,NANCY,Huh?
186017,L226413,u5421,m360,PAULA,That's debatable.
186018,L226412,u5420,m360,NANCY,Are they grown-ups?
186019,L226411,u5421,m360,PAULA,"Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared."
186020,L226410,u5420,m360,NANCY,Why?
186021,L226409,u5421,m360,PAULA,"You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other."
186022,L226408,u5420,m360,NANCY,I found it outside.
186023,L226407,u5421,m360,PAULA,Where'd you get this?
186024,L226294,u5420,m360,NANCY,No more.
186025,L226293,u5421,m360,PAULA,"...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?"
186026,L226292,u5421,m360,PAULA,"Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?..."
186027,L226291,u5420,m360,NANCY,Nancy.
186028,L226290,u5421,m360,PAULA,"Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?"
186029,L226289,u5420,m360,NANCY,"No, he was real.  Like on TV."
186030,L226288,u5421,m360,PAULA,You mean you had a bad dream.
186031,L226285,u5420,m360,NANCY,There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
186032,L226284,u5421,m360,PAULA,So what happened?
186033,L226373,u5423,m360,SISSY,I think somebody's messin' around out there.
186034,L226372,u5421,m360,PAULA,What's goin' on?
186035,L226300,u5423,m360,SISSY,"Yeah, he was gonna check out ""things that go bump in the night."""
186036,L226299,u5421,m360,PAULA,He didn't say anything?
186037,L226298,u5423,m360,SISSY,"I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off."
186038,L226297,u5421,m360,PAULA,I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
186039,L226283,u5423,m360,SISSY,"Yeah, we're here."
186040,L226282,u5421,m360,PAULA,Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
186041,L226276,u5423,m360,SISSY,"Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but..."
186042,L226275,u5421,m360,PAULA,No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
186043,L226274,u5423,m360,SISSY,Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
186044,L226273,u5421,m360,PAULA,"Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people."
186045,L226272,u5423,m360,SISSY,"Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife."
186046,L226264,u5421,m360,PAULA,You gotta be kidding!
186047,L226263,u5423,m360,SISSY,Boy scouting.
186048,L226262,u5421,m360,PAULA,Which is?
186049,L226261,u5423,m360,SISSY,Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
186050,L226260,u5421,m360,PAULA,So where's Cort gone off to?
186051,L226176,u5423,m360,SISSY,All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
186052,L226175,u5421,m360,PAULA,It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
186053,L226429,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
186054,L226428,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Doesn't that tell you something?!
186055,L226425,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde."
186056,L226424,u5425,m360,TOMMY,You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
186057,L226397,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Please don't do anything crazy.
186058,L226396,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy."
186059,L226257,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
186060,L226256,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance."
186061,L226247,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up."
186062,L226246,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,I've seen it.
186063,L226245,u5425,m360,TOMMY,I gotta show you Jason's grave.
186064,L226193,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him."
186065,L226192,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind."
186066,L226187,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
186067,L226186,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Yes!
186068,L226178,u5425,m360,TOMMY,I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
186069,L226177,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
186070,L226141,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
186071,L226140,u5425,m360,TOMMY,You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
186072,L226139,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
186073,L226138,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying."
186074,L226137,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they..."
186075,L226136,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Why didn't you cremate him?!
186076,L226131,u5425,m360,TOMMY,There's no time for this bullshit...
186077,L226130,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about..."
186078,L226127,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"Yes, but they released me because..."
186079,L226126,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?"
186080,L226125,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
186081,L226124,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
186082,L226123,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
186083,L226122,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?"
186084,L226121,u5425,m360,TOMMY,Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
186085,L226120,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains."
186086,L226119,u5425,m360,TOMMY,"Will you listen, dammit!"
186087,L226118,u5422,m360,SHERIFF,"Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces."
186088,L226583,u5428,m361,DUKE,"-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing."
186089,L226582,u5426,m361,CAMPBELL,"Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --"
186090,L226580,u5428,m361,DUKE,Skin stretcher was human.
186091,L226579,u5426,m361,CAMPBELL,"I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher."
186092,L226578,u5428,m361,DUKE,"-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable."
186093,L226577,u5426,m361,CAMPBELL,"In the media, you've frequently been described as ""salty"" --"
186094,L226576,u5428,m361,DUKE,"Yeah, that'd be a big shame..."
186095,L226575,u5426,m361,CAMPBELL,"Well, let's hope not!"
186096,L226574,u5428,m361,DUKE,"They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell."
186097,L226573,u5426,m361,CAMPBELL,-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
186098,L226572,u5428,m361,DUKE,"Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --"
186099,L226571,u5426,m361,CAMPBELL,Eight times.
186100,L226570,u5428,m361,DUKE,"How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?"
186101,L226569,u5426,m361,CAMPBELL,"Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?"
186102,L226753,u5427,m361,DIANA,I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
186103,L226752,u5433,m361,STEVEN,I'm here.
186104,L226751,u5427,m361,DIANA,Steven...

186110,L226674,u5427,m361,DIANA,"...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk."
186111,L226600,u5427,m361,DIANA,Yes.
186112,L226599,u5433,m361,STEVEN,Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?

186115,L226648,u5427,m361,DIANA,You need to leave.
186116,L226647,u5428,m361,DUKE,You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
186117,L226646,u5427,m361,DIANA,What do you want?
186118,L226645,u5428,m361,DUKE,Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
186119,L226644,u5427,m361,DIANA,"Look, I don't want your money!"
186120,L226643,u5428,m361,DUKE,"Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?"
186121,L226642,u5427,m361,DIANA,Look --

186125,L226637,u5428,m361,DUKE,You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
186126,L226636,u5427,m361,DIANA,Jason Voorhees is dead.

186130,L226632,u5427,m361,DIANA,I know who you are.
186131,L226630,u5428,m361,DUKE,Yes.

186143,L226614,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,Steven buggin' you?
186144,L226613,u5427,m361,DIANA,"Not so bad, today."

186160,L226838,u5428,m361,DUKE,Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.

186177,L226656,u5428,m361,DUKE,Maybe you should mind your own business.
186178,L226655,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,Maybe you should be moving on.

186205,L226719,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki."
186206,L226718,u5431,m361,RANDY,I'm now begging you.
186207,L226717,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head."
186208,L226716,u5431,m361,RANDY,"Oh my God, Steven."
186209,L226715,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?"
186210,L226714,u5431,m361,RANDY,"Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?"

186212,L226711,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"Next, you dial a number."
186213,L226710,u5431,m361,RANDY,"Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen..."
186214,L226709,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance."
186215,L226708,u5431,m361,RANDY,What are you doing?
186216,L226702,u5433,m361,STEVEN,Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
186217,L226701,u5431,m361,RANDY,It was a community service.
186218,L226698,u5431,m361,RANDY,"Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit."
186219,L226697,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?"
186220,L226696,u5431,m361,RANDY,"Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely."
186221,L226780,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,"Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch..."
186222,L226779,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!"
186223,L226778,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
186224,L226777,u5433,m361,STEVEN,She did!
186225,L226776,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
186226,L226775,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --"
186227,L226774,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
186228,L226773,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,-- Bad?!
186229,L226772,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"Look, I know I treated her bad --"
186230,L226771,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
186231,L226770,u5433,m361,STEVEN,About Jessica.
186232,L226769,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,About what?
186233,L226768,u5433,m361,STEVEN,She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
186234,L226767,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
186235,L226766,u5433,m361,STEVEN,I didn't kill her!
186236,L226765,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,You don't know shit!
186237,L226764,u5433,m361,STEVEN,I know what it sounds like.
186238,L226763,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,"The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night."
186239,L226762,u5433,m361,STEVEN,I've told you the truth.
186240,L226761,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,Until I hear the truth.
186241,L226760,u5433,m361,STEVEN,How many times do you want to hear this?
186242,L226757,u5433,m361,STEVEN,He was dead.  He had to be dead...
186243,L226756,u5432,m361,SHERIFF,"Oh, my dear God..."
186244,L226724,u5434,m361,VICKI,A pizza?!
186245,L226723,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza."
186246,L226722,u5434,m361,VICKI,I'm literally going to kill you!
186247,L226721,u5433,m361,STEVEN,She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
186248,L226720,u5434,m361,VICKI,Steven!
186249,L226700,u5433,m361,STEVEN,Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
186250,L226699,u5434,m361,VICKI,That's disgusting.
186251,L226695,u5433,m361,STEVEN,I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
186252,L226694,u5434,m361,VICKI,I mean really never.
186253,L226693,u5433,m361,STEVEN,"You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?"
186254,L226692,u5434,m361,VICKI,Never.
186255,L226691,u5433,m361,STEVEN,What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
186256,L227205,u5435,m362,EVA,I don't care about being hip anymore.
186257,L227204,u5444,m362,WAYNE,"So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend."
186258,L227203,u5435,m362,EVA,But she might be in trouble...
186259,L227202,u5444,m362,WAYNE,No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
186260,L227201,u5435,m362,EVA,Have you seen Tamara?
186261,L227200,u5435,m362,EVA,Jason...Voorhees?
186262,L227199,u5444,m362,WAYNE,The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
186263,L227198,u5435,m362,EVA,What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
186264,L227073,u5443,m362,TAMARA,But...wait a minute!
186265,L227072,u5435,m362,EVA,"I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?"
186266,L227071,u5443,m362,TAMARA,Time to check out the waiters.
186267,L227070,u5435,m362,EVA,Yeah.
186268,L227069,u5443,m362,TAMARA,That was truly excellent.
186269,L227055,u5443,m362,TAMARA,"Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water..."
186270,L227054,u5435,m362,EVA,What are you going to do?
186271,L227044,u5443,m362,TAMARA,Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
186272,L227043,u5435,m362,EVA,I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
186273,L227042,u5443,m362,TAMARA,A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
186274,L227036,u5443,m362,TAMARA,"Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight."
186275,L227035,u5435,m362,EVA,I guess not.
186276,L227034,u5443,m362,TAMARA,"You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?"
186277,L227033,u5435,m362,EVA,"It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything."
186278,L227032,u5443,m362,TAMARA,What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
186279,L227031,u5435,m362,EVA,No thanks.
186280,L227024,u5443,m362,TAMARA,"You're joking, right?"
186281,L227023,u5435,m362,EVA,Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
186282,L227022,u5443,m362,TAMARA,"I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl."
186283,L227020,u5443,m362,TAMARA,"My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me."
186284,L227019,u5435,m362,EVA,My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
186285,L227018,u5443,m362,TAMARA,"He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is."
186286,L226947,u5443,m362,TAMARA,"Improvise, of course."
186287,L226946,u5435,m362,EVA,What are you going to do?
186288,L226945,u5443,m362,TAMARA,A major prick.
186289,L226934,u5443,m362,TAMARA,More or less. It's part of my college fund.
186290,L226933,u5435,m362,EVA,He bought you that?
186291,L226932,u5443,m362,TAMARA,It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
186292,L226931,u5443,m362,TAMARA,I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
186293,L226930,u5435,m362,EVA,Really?
186294,L226929,u5443,m362,TAMARA,I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
186295,L226891,u5442,m362,SUZY,No.
186296,L226890,u5436,m362,JIM,And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
186297,L226889,u5442,m362,SUZY,And you'll never do it again.
186298,L226888,u5436,m362,JIM,"All right, all right -- I'm a major ass."
186299,L226881,u5436,m362,JIM,Hear what?
186300,L226880,u5442,m362,SUZY,Did you hear that?
186301,L226878,u5442,m362,SUZY,So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
186302,L226877,u5436,m362,JIM,Right.
186303,L226876,u5442,m362,SUZY,"I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?"
186304,L226875,u5436,m362,JIM,Right.
186305,L226860,u5436,m362,JIM,"There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?"
186306,L226859,u5442,m362,SUZY,Tell me.
186307,L226858,u5436,m362,JIM,"Never mind, you don't want to know about it."
186308,L226857,u5442,m362,SUZY,What murders?
186309,L226854,u5436,m362,JIM,Nothing.
186310,L226853,u5442,m362,SUZY,What's wrong?
186311,L226849,u5442,m362,SUZY,Ask me in about five minutes.
186312,L226848,u5436,m362,JIM,Well...how do you feel?
186313,L227357,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Don't be ridiculous!
186314,L227356,u5441,m362,SEAN,Jason's here in New York.
186315,L227292,u5441,m362,SEAN,We have to get off this ship!!
186316,L227291,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Dear Christ...
186317,L227286,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"Not another word, do you hear me??"
186318,L227285,u5441,m362,SEAN,This is Jason's fault!
186319,L227284,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
186320,L227246,u5441,m362,SEAN,The fire alarm...
186321,L227245,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,What's that?
186322,L227196,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
186323,L227195,u5441,m362,SEAN,She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
186324,L227194,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Christ...where's Rennie??
186325,L227177,u5441,m362,SEAN,It's...dead.
186326,L227176,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Where's the radio?
186327,L226905,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five."
186328,L226904,u5441,m362,SEAN,But I thought...
186329,L226903,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Rennie's not coming.
186330,L226902,u5441,m362,SEAN,"Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?"
186331,L227103,u5443,m362,TAMARA,But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
186332,L227102,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
186333,L227101,u5443,m362,TAMARA,I packed it. Just for us.
186334,L227100,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Where did you get that alcohol?
186335,L227053,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
186336,L227052,u5443,m362,TAMARA,They're out of town.
186337,L227051,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents."
186338,L227048,u5443,m362,TAMARA,Nothing.
186339,L227047,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,What are you doing in here?
186340,L226944,u5443,m362,TAMARA,Perfectly.
186341,L226943,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?"
186342,L227334,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
186343,L227333,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,I don't think that's such a safe idea
186344,L227332,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
186345,L227317,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson."
186346,L227316,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,There must be a phone around here somewhere.
186347,L227282,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
186348,L227281,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,What did you do with Rennie??
186349,L227253,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
186350,L227252,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,What are you talking about?
186351,L227251,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,I doubt very much that one even exists.
186352,L227242,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!"
186353,L227241,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"He's doing the best he can, Charles."
186354,L227240,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?"
186355,L227239,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,Did you find Rennie?
186356,L227189,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Walking corpses are not real!
186357,L227188,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
186358,L227187,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
186359,L227186,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,What are you doing??
186360,L227175,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,Oh dear God...
186361,L227174,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,I demand to know what is going on...
186362,L227136,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,Where is she?
186363,L227135,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,I thought I told you to stay away from her.
186364,L227092,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen."
186365,L227091,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"She's fine, Charles. Take it easy..."
186366,L226958,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"No, I think it's just the beginning."
186367,L226957,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion."
186368,L226956,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live."
186369,L226955,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
186370,L226954,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
186371,L226953,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,You have no right...
186372,L226952,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"Charles, there's someone else coming along too."
186373,L226951,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
186374,L226950,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
186375,L226949,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
186376,L226948,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?"
186377,L227385,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!"
186378,L227384,u5445,m362,YOUNG RENNIE,I...I can't...
186379,L227382,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Am I? Let's find out.
186380,L227381,u5445,m362,YOUNG RENNIE,You're telling a lie.
186381,L227380,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim."
186382,L227379,u5445,m362,YOUNG RENNIE,He is not.
186383,L227378,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
186384,L227375,u5445,m362,YOUNG RENNIE,I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
186385,L227374,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how."
186386,L227373,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"Perfect for a swim, isn't it?"
186387,L227372,u5445,m362,YOUNG RENNIE,What a beautiful day.
186388,L227388,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life."
186389,L227387,u5440,m362,RENNIE,You pushed me...
186390,L227297,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,You can and you will!!
186391,L227296,u5440,m362,RENNIE,I...I can't...
186392,L227295,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"Get in the boat, Rennie!"
186393,L227228,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,This isn't a request.
186394,L227227,u5440,m362,RENNIE,"I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles."
186395,L227226,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about."
186396,L227225,u5440,m362,RENNIE,But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
186397,L227224,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
186398,L227223,u5440,m362,RENNIE,Can't we at least talk about it?
186399,L227217,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
186400,L227216,u5440,m362,RENNIE,But Sean said...
186401,L227215,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,You had me worried to death!
186402,L227002,u5440,m362,RENNIE,I'm staying.
186403,L227001,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
186404,L227000,u5440,m362,RENNIE,"I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?"
186405,L226999,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,Why are you doing this to yourself?
186406,L226998,u5440,m362,RENNIE,She didn't push me into coming.
186407,L226997,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
186408,L226996,u5440,m362,RENNIE,I'm staying.
186409,L226995,u5437,m362,MCCULLOCH,"You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land."
186410,L227089,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees."
186411,L227088,u5440,m362,RENNIE,No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
186412,L227087,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,Did you have an accident in the lake?
186413,L227086,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,After your parents passed away?
186414,L227085,u5440,m362,RENNIE,About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
186415,L227084,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,When did this start?
186416,L227083,u5440,m362,RENNIE,"Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him."
186417,L227082,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?"
186418,L227081,u5440,m362,RENNIE,It's not that simple.
186419,L227080,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since."
186420,L227079,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,I gathered that.
186421,L227078,u5440,m362,RENNIE,I can't swim.
186422,L227064,u5440,m362,RENNIE,There's something I haven't told you...
186423,L227063,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me."
186424,L227062,u5440,m362,RENNIE,Yeah...a lot.
186425,L227061,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"So, are you having fun yet?"
186426,L227060,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?"
186427,L227059,u5440,m362,RENNIE,Have you seen my dog anywhere?
186428,L227058,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
186429,L226922,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you."
186430,L226921,u5440,m362,RENNIE,I don't know what to say...
186431,L226920,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
186432,L226917,u5440,m362,RENNIE,"That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?"
186433,L226916,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody."
186434,L226915,u5440,m362,RENNIE,Really?
186435,L226914,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
186436,L226913,u5440,m362,RENNIE,Just felt a little chill.
186437,L226912,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,Everything okay?
186438,L226911,u5440,m362,RENNIE,What about not-so-great writers?
186439,L226910,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,"You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision."
186440,L226909,u5440,m362,RENNIE,Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
186441,L226908,u5438,m362,MISS VAN DEUSEN,I'm glad you decided to come after all.
186442,L227172,u5439,m362,RADIO OFFICER,"Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec..."
186443,L227171,u5441,m362,SEAN,I've got the numbers.
186444,L227170,u5439,m362,RADIO OFFICER,The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
186445,L227169,u5441,m362,SEAN,Yes...
186446,L227168,u5439,m362,RADIO OFFICER,Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
186447,L227167,u5441,m362,SEAN,I...I don't know...
186448,L227166,u5439,m362,RADIO OFFICER,What is your location?
186449,L227165,u5441,m362,SEAN,The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
186450,L227409,u5440,m362,RENNIE,"Please, hurry..."
186451,L227408,u5441,m362,SEAN,You have to call the police...
186452,L227349,u5440,m362,RENNIE,"Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean."
186453,L227348,u5441,m362,SEAN,Rennie...what'd they do to you??
186454,L227275,u5440,m362,RENNIE,I'm not!!
186455,L227274,u5441,m362,SEAN,But Rennie...
186456,L227273,u5440,m362,RENNIE,I'm not going near any lifeboat!
186457,L227272,u5441,m362,SEAN,"We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case."
186458,L227269,u5440,m362,RENNIE,Is the ship going to sink??
186459,L227268,u5441,m362,SEAN,"Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly..."
186460,L227263,u5440,m362,RENNIE,The window...
186461,L227262,u5441,m362,SEAN,Rennie...??
186462,L227155,u5440,m362,RENNIE,"Just radio for help, okay???"
186463,L227154,u5441,m362,SEAN,I didn't mean for you to go!
186464,L227153,u5441,m362,SEAN,The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
186465,L227152,u5440,m362,RENNIE,Where are they?
186466,L227151,u5441,m362,SEAN,I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
186467,L227148,u5440,m362,RENNIE,What do you mean???
186468,L227147,u5441,m362,SEAN,I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
186469,L227130,u5441,m362,SEAN,"If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do."
186470,L227129,u5440,m362,RENNIE,What about you?
186471,L227128,u5441,m362,SEAN,Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
186472,L227127,u5440,m362,RENNIE,Can he really take us home?
186473,L227118,u5440,m362,RENNIE,I want to go home. I want off this ship.
186474,L227117,u5441,m362,SEAN,It's okay...you're going to be okay.
186475,L226991,u5440,m362,RENNIE,I'd love to.
186476,L226990,u5441,m362,SEAN,"I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall."
186477,L226988,u5441,m362,SEAN,Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
186478,L226987,u5440,m362,RENNIE,But I didn't get you one...
186479,L226986,u5441,m362,SEAN,I got you a present.
186480,L226985,u5440,m362,RENNIE,We changed our minds.
186481,L226984,u5441,m362,SEAN,I heard you weren't coming.
186482,L226983,u5440,m362,RENNIE,"Hi, Sean."
186483,L226982,u5441,m362,SEAN,Rennie...
186484,L230237,u5455,m363,NICKY,That's where I peed.
186485,L230236,u5446,m363,DRIVER,Under the Manhattan Bridge.
186486,L230233,u5455,m363,NICKY,I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
186487,L230232,u5446,m363,DRIVER,"I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen."
186488,L230231,u5455,m363,NICKY,I never left the garage without my Windex.
186489,L230018,u5455,m363,NICKY,Do not inhale.
186490,L230017,u5446,m363,DRIVER,Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
186491,L230016,u5455,m363,NICKY,We must abandon.
186492,L230013,u5446,m363,DRIVER,Ruptured steam pipe.
186493,L230012,u5455,m363,NICKY,"What do you mean, we must abandon?"
186494,L230011,u5446,m363,DRIVER,We must abandon.
186495,L229951,u5446,m363,DRIVER,Very bad today.
186496,L229950,u5455,m363,NICKY,Crosstown.
186497,L229949,u5446,m363,DRIVER,You are going where?
186498,L229948,u5455,m363,NICKY,I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
186499,L229908,u5455,m363,NICKY,I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
186500,L229907,u5446,m363,DRIVER,Big mess every time.
186501,L229906,u5455,m363,NICKY,What did you find?
186502,L229905,u5446,m363,DRIVER,I opened thousands of brains.
186503,L229904,u5455,m363,NICKY,Very big.
186504,L229903,u5446,m363,DRIVER,"I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding."
186505,L229900,u5446,m363,DRIVER,"Where you're going, mister?"
186506,L229899,u5455,m363,NICKY,I used to drive a taxi.
186507,L230058,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
186508,L230057,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Alla puttanesca.
186509,L230056,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Say it again.
186510,L230053,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
186511,L230052,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,This is a great young out-of-work actress.
186512,L230051,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Elliot?
186513,L230050,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
186514,L230049,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Guys ready to order?
186515,L230325,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,She was very evasive.
186516,L230324,u5455,m363,NICKY,Had to be him.
186517,L230323,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
186518,L230322,u5455,m363,NICKY,What do you mean?
186519,L230321,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Paisley Porter.
186520,L230320,u5455,m363,NICKY,How do you Eknow.
186521,L230319,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Keep going west. Last building before the river.
186522,L230318,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?"
186523,L230317,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,The American theater doesn't need people like that.
186524,L230316,u5455,m363,NICKY,Shoot him.
186525,L230313,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,There are things that speak to us from the past.
186526,L230312,u5455,m363,NICKY,What?
186527,L230311,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,"`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend."
186528,L230310,u5455,m363,NICKY,We were thinking of putting in a pool.
186529,L230309,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,"He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow."
186530,L230308,u5455,m363,NICKY,He'll hate it.
186531,L230307,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,"It's your best play, Nicky."
186532,L230306,u5455,m363,NICKY,In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
186533,L230303,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
186534,L230302,u5455,m363,NICKY,I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
186535,L230301,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,"No, we're not."
186536,L230300,u5455,m363,NICKY,We're making too much of this.
186537,L230297,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,That was a big mistake.
186538,L230296,u5455,m363,NICKY,"I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now."
186539,L230295,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Where is it?
186540,L230294,u5455,m363,NICKY,I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
186541,L230293,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Then you should carry a gun.
186542,L230292,u5455,m363,NICKY,He carries a gun.
186543,L230113,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,What about the haircut?
186544,L230112,u5455,m363,NICKY,Don't wait Efor me.
186545,L230111,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Where are you going?
186546,L230107,u5455,m363,NICKY,I don't have the problems that artists have.
186547,L230106,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
186548,L230105,u5455,m363,NICKY,Here we go.
186549,L230104,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,I'm not ready.
186550,L230103,u5455,m363,NICKY,Do not inhale.
186551,L230102,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,You say we go?
186552,L230101,u5455,m363,NICKY,I say we go.
186553,L230100,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,I think we Nought to wait.
186554,L230099,u5455,m363,NICKY,Do we care?
186555,L230098,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Is it safe?
186556,L230078,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,"I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me."
186557,L230077,u5455,m363,NICKY,What was it like?
186558,L230076,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,"Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?"
186559,L230046,u5455,m363,NICKY,A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
186560,L230045,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
186561,L230044,u5455,m363,NICKY,That's awful.
186562,L230043,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
186563,L230042,u5455,m363,NICKY,And he was there?
186564,L230041,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,"Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers."
186565,L230040,u5455,m363,NICKY,What happened eighteen months ago?
186566,L230039,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,That's what I said eighteen months ago.
186567,L230038,u5455,m363,NICKY,What's the fuss? I don't get it.
186568,L230037,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
186569,L230036,u5455,m363,NICKY,It's just a review.
186570,L230035,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
186571,L230034,u5455,m363,NICKY,You mean because What's-His-Name.
186572,L230033,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
186573,L230032,u5455,m363,NICKY,Tonight. What's tonight?
186574,L230031,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
186575,L230030,u5455,m363,NICKY,Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
186576,L230029,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,What do I exude?
186577,L230028,u5455,m363,NICKY,You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
186578,L230027,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,"I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute."
186579,L230026,u5455,m363,NICKY,I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
186580,L230024,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Do not inhale.
186581,L230023,u5455,m363,NICKY,We must abandon.
186582,L230022,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Asbestos lining.
186583,L230021,u5455,m363,NICKY,Very dangerous.
186584,L230010,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
186585,L230009,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do."
186586,L230008,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,But didn't we know it would happen?
186587,L230007,u5455,m363,NICKY,I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
186588,L230006,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
186589,L230005,u5455,m363,NICKY,"It's over, finished and done with."
186590,L230004,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Don't talk like that.
186591,L230003,u5455,m363,NICKY,She wants a divorce.
186592,L230002,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
186593,L230001,u5455,m363,NICKY,Ride with me. We need a haircut.
186594,L230000,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Press a button and they give us money.
186595,L229999,u5455,m363,NICKY,You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
186596,L229998,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Quietly effective.
186597,L229997,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Shut up, Elliot."
186598,L229996,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
186599,L229995,u5455,m363,NICKY,I don't want to hear about it.
186600,L229994,u5447,m363,ELLIOT,Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
186601,L230520,u5455,m363,NICKY,You're not making sense. Make sense.
186602,L230519,u5448,m363,FIRST MAN,Did you see the winning run score?
186603,L230518,u5455,m363,NICKY,Of course I saw it.
186604,L230513,u5455,m363,NICKY,Yes. What are you implying?
186605,L230512,u5448,m363,FIRST MAN,What are we talking about?
186606,L230511,u5455,m363,NICKY,What are you talking about?
186607,L230510,u5448,m363,FIRST MAN,I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
186608,L230504,u5455,m363,NICKY,Classic.
186609,L230503,u5448,m363,FIRST MAN,Unbelievable.
186610,L230502,u5455,m363,NICKY,Great game.
186611,L230368,u5457,m363,PETER,This could be it.
186612,L230367,u5449,m363,JACK,This could be it.
186613,L230366,u5457,m363,PETER,Does what feel comfortable?
186614,L230365,u5449,m363,JACK,Does it feel comfortable?
186615,L230364,u5457,m363,PETER,This could be it.
186616,L230363,u5449,m363,JACK,This could be it.
186617,L230362,u5457,m363,PETER,This could be it.
186618,L230361,u5449,m363,JACK,This could be it.
186619,L230200,u5457,m363,PETER,This could be it.
186620,L230199,u5449,m363,JACK,This could Pbe it.
186621,L230179,u5457,m363,PETER,Let's work on it.
186622,L230178,u5449,m363,JACK,Let's work on it.
186623,L230177,u5457,m363,PETER,This could be it.
186624,L230176,u5449,m363,JACK,This could be it.
186625,L229947,u5450,m363,JOANNA,He will absolutely hate it.
186626,L229946,u5455,m363,NICKY,They'll lose because they're my team.
186627,L229945,u5450,m363,JOANNA,"It's your best play, Nicky."
186628,L229944,u5455,m363,NICKY,It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
186629,L229943,u5450,m363,JOANNA,It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
186630,L229942,u5455,m363,NICKY,The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
186631,L229941,u5450,m363,JOANNA,I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
186632,L229940,u5455,m363,NICKY,"We don't even like each other, do we?"
186633,L229939,u5450,m363,JOANNA,Because we're completely mismatched.
186634,L229938,u5455,m363,NICKY,In and out of bed.
186635,L229937,u5450,m363,JOANNA,We're able to surprise each other.
186636,L229936,u5455,m363,NICKY,This is how we've managed to last.
186637,L229935,u5450,m363,JOANNA,I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
186638,L229933,u5450,m363,JOANNA,It can't be all that personal.
186639,L229932,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old."
186640,L229931,u5450,m363,JOANNA,You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
186641,L229930,u5455,m363,NICKY,The Red Sox
186642,L229929,u5450,m363,JOANNA,What?
186643,L229928,u5455,m363,NICKY,They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
186644,L229927,u5450,m363,JOANNA,"Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else."
186645,L229926,u5455,m363,NICKY,Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
186646,L229925,u5450,m363,JOANNA,Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
186647,L229924,u5455,m363,NICKY,About what?
186648,L229923,u5450,m363,JOANNA,"That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed."
186649,L229922,u5455,m363,NICKY,"I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems."
186650,L229921,u5450,m363,JOANNA,They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
186651,L229920,u5455,m363,NICKY,Can he get through it?
186652,L229919,u5450,m363,JOANNA,"Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie."
186653,L229918,u5455,m363,NICKY,Our Peter?
186654,L229917,u5450,m363,JOANNA,"Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course."
186655,L229916,u5455,m363,NICKY,I talked to her two days ago.
186656,L229915,u5450,m363,JOANNA,She died.
186657,L229914,u5455,m363,NICKY,She's dying.
186658,L229913,u5450,m363,JOANNA,What about her?
186659,L229912,u5455,m363,NICKY,You know about Adele.
186660,L229911,u5450,m363,JOANNA,Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
186661,L229910,u5455,m363,NICKY,I hear Alan's sick.
186662,L229909,u5450,m363,JOANNA,Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
186663,L230572,u5451,m363,LAUREL,"Daddy, wait."
186664,L230571,u5455,m363,NICKY,I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
186665,L230569,u5455,m363,NICKY,There's nothing left for me to lie about.
186666,L230568,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Will I believe you when you tell me something?
186667,L230567,u5455,m363,NICKY,Everything.
186668,L230566,u5451,m363,LAUREL,What will we talk about?
186669,L230564,u5455,m363,NICKY,I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
186670,L230563,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Except I won't have a father anymore.
186671,L230562,u5455,m363,NICKY,Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
186672,L230227,u5451,m363,LAUREL,I'm not sure.
186673,L230226,u5455,m363,NICKY,Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
186674,L230225,u5451,m363,LAUREL,I have a class. I'm late.
186675,L230224,u5455,m363,NICKY,And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
186676,L230223,u5451,m363,LAUREL,I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
186677,L230222,u5455,m363,NICKY,Take it yourself. Take a date.
186678,L230221,u5451,m363,LAUREL,"Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it."
186679,L230220,u5451,m363,LAUREL,I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
186680,L230219,u5455,m363,NICKY,Opening night?
186681,L230218,u5451,m363,LAUREL,"Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going."
186682,L230217,u5455,m363,NICKY,Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
186683,L229991,u5455,m363,NICKY,This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
186684,L229990,u5451,m363,LAUREL,I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
186685,L229989,u5455,m363,NICKY,Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
186686,L229988,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
186687,L229986,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend."
186688,L229985,u5451,m363,LAUREL,She is kicking you out.
186689,L229984,u5455,m363,NICKY,You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
186690,L229983,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
186691,L229982,u5455,m363,NICKY,Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
186692,L229981,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
186693,L229980,u5455,m363,NICKY,I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
186694,L229979,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
186695,L229978,u5455,m363,NICKY,"If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?"
186696,L229968,u5455,m363,NICKY,And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
186697,L229967,u5451,m363,LAUREL,She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
186698,L229966,u5455,m363,NICKY,Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
186699,L229965,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Is it?
186700,L229964,u5455,m363,NICKY,That's completely crazy.
186701,L229963,u5451,m363,LAUREL,So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
186702,L229962,u5455,m363,NICKY,Why do you need a radio?
186703,L229961,u5451,m363,LAUREL,"I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?"
186704,L229960,u5455,m363,NICKY,What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
186705,L229959,u5451,m363,LAUREL,"I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about."
186706,L229958,u5455,m363,NICKY,Do you want to get some coffee?
186707,L229957,u5451,m363,LAUREL,I go to college. I thought you knew.
186708,L229956,u5455,m363,NICKY,I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
186709,L230596,u5460,m363,STEVEN,And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
186710,L230595,u5451,m363,LAUREL,"See, Daddy."
186711,L230592,u5460,m363,STEVEN,An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
186712,L230591,u5451,m363,LAUREL,What else?
186713,L230590,u5460,m363,STEVEN,I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
186714,L230589,u5451,m363,LAUREL,"See, Daddy."
186715,L230588,u5460,m363,STEVEN,"It's your best play, Nicky."
186716,L230587,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
186717,L230559,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Yes.
186718,L230558,u5460,m363,STEVEN,Am I really so deeply repugnant?
186719,L230549,u5451,m363,LAUREL,You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
186720,L230548,u5460,m363,STEVEN,Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
186721,L230547,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
186722,L230546,u5460,m363,STEVEN,What's sexy?
186723,L230545,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
186724,L230544,u5460,m363,STEVEN,Mystery. Deception.
186725,L230543,u5451,m363,LAUREL,What do we want?
186726,L230542,u5460,m363,STEVEN,We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
186727,L230541,u5451,m363,LAUREL,"I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself."
186728,L230540,u5460,m363,STEVEN,This building is not secure.
186729,L230539,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Yes.
186730,L230538,u5460,m363,STEVEN,If you're wondering about the firearm.
186731,L230535,u5451,m363,LAUREL,A flat-out hit.
186732,L230534,u5460,m363,STEVEN,What else?
186733,L230533,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Packs an emotional wallop.
186734,L230532,u5460,m363,STEVEN,What else?
186735,L230531,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Brilliantly moving.
186736,L230530,u5460,m363,STEVEN,First you tell me.
186737,L230529,u5451,m363,LAUREL,You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
186738,L230528,u5460,m363,STEVEN,Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
186739,L230527,u5451,m363,LAUREL,I'm willing to tell you my name.
186740,L230526,u5460,m363,STEVEN,It's only our first date.
186741,L230525,u5451,m363,LAUREL,Why won't you tell me your name?
186742,L230422,u5455,m363,NICKY,I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
186743,L230421,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,I'm glad we're having this talk.
186744,L230420,u5455,m363,NICKY,We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
186745,L230419,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
186746,L230418,u5455,m363,NICKY,It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
186747,L230417,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,It violates so many trusts.
186748,L230416,u5455,m363,NICKY,"I am really, deeply sorry."
186749,L230415,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,She's my gynecologist.
186750,L230414,u5455,m363,NICKY,"I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman."
186751,L230413,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,"Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?"
186752,L230412,u5455,m363,NICKY,Alma Wetzel.
186753,L230411,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,Joanne Bourne.
186754,L230410,u5455,m363,NICKY,I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
186755,L230409,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
186756,L230408,u5455,m363,NICKY,There may be things you'd rather not know about.
186757,L230407,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,Be open with me. I'd like that.
186758,L230406,u5455,m363,NICKY,Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
186759,L230405,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,That's very lovely actually.
186760,L230404,u5455,m363,NICKY,I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
186761,L230403,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,I'd forgotten that.
186762,L230402,u5455,m363,NICKY,"You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw."
186763,L230401,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,"You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian."
186764,L230400,u5455,m363,NICKY,And you've been extremely patient.
186765,L230399,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,That's always been my problem.
186766,L230398,u5455,m363,NICKY,The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
186767,L230397,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,Who the hell cares?
186768,L230396,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Opening night, Lillian."
186769,L230392,u5455,m363,NICKY,Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
186770,L230391,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
186771,L230390,u5455,m363,NICKY,I'll have whatever she's having.
186772,L230389,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
186773,L230388,u5455,m363,NICKY,How prominent?
186774,L230387,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
186775,L230386,u5455,m363,NICKY,All right. What's been going on?
186776,L230385,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,"I want to be fair-minded, Nicky."
186777,L230384,u5455,m363,NICKY,We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
186778,L230383,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
186779,L230382,u5455,m363,NICKY,Two-all after six.
186780,L230381,u5452,m363,LILLIAN,Your father said you might be here.
186781,L230500,u5455,m363,NICKY,Life is real.
186782,L230499,u5453,m363,MATTHEW,Life is true.
186783,L230493,u5453,m363,MATTHEW,This could be it!
186784,L230492,u5455,m363,NICKY,This could be it!
186785,L230484,u5453,m363,MATTHEW,You're hurting my head.
186786,L230483,u5455,m363,NICKY,A thousand things.
186787,L230482,u5453,m363,MATTHEW,What did it say?
186788,L230481,u5455,m363,NICKY,It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
186789,L230474,u5455,m363,NICKY,One more out.
186790,L230473,u5453,m363,MATTHEW,Washed away.
186791,L230472,u5455,m363,NICKY,"All the failures, all the fatalism."
186792,L230452,u5455,m363,NICKY,I don't know if I can say that.
186793,L230451,u5453,m363,MATTHEW,People are dependable.
186794,L230446,u5455,m363,NICKY,Life is good.
186795,L230445,u5453,m363,MATTHEW,Life is good.
186796,L230425,u5455,m363,NICKY,They're always winning. Until they lose.
186797,L230424,u5453,m363,MATTHEW,Great game. Red Sox are winning.
186798,L230370,u5455,m363,NICKY,I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
186799,L230369,u5453,m363,MATTHEW,What's it like to shoot somebody?
186800,L230354,u5455,m363,NICKY,This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
186801,L230353,u5453,m363,MATTHEW,What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
186802,L230291,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,Show him who we are.
186803,L230290,u5455,m363,NICKY,What do you want me to do?
186804,L230289,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,So what are you going to do about it?
186805,L230288,u5455,m363,NICKY,"I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from."
186806,L230287,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
186807,L230286,u5455,m363,NICKY,Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
186808,L230285,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
186809,L230284,u5455,m363,NICKY,I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
186810,L230283,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
186811,L230282,u5455,m363,NICKY,"I know, Pop."
186812,L230281,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
186813,L230278,u5455,m363,NICKY,I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
186814,L230277,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,I lost it. I lose everything.
186815,L230276,u5455,m363,NICKY,You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
186816,L230275,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,I can't find it.
186817,L230274,u5455,m363,NICKY,Where's your elastic brace?
186818,L230273,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,My back is killing me.
186819,L230272,u5455,m363,NICKY,Let's not start that again.
186820,L230271,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,Since when did that matter?
186821,L230270,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think."
186822,L230269,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
186823,L230268,u5455,m363,NICKY,You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
186824,L230267,u5455,m363,NICKY,I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
186825,L230266,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,But the son is suppose to stop crying.
186826,L230265,u5455,m363,NICKY,"It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember."
186827,L230264,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,"It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things."
186828,L230263,u5455,m363,NICKY,Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
186829,L230262,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
186830,L230261,u5455,m363,NICKY,Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
186831,L230260,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,They're only gonna lose.
186832,L230259,u5455,m363,NICKY,I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
186833,L230258,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,You know the answer to that.
186834,L230257,u5455,m363,NICKY,Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
186835,L230256,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
186836,L230255,u5455,m363,NICKY,We must have been heroic.
186837,L230254,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,Get yourself something to eat.
186838,L230253,u5455,m363,NICKY,"It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms."
186839,L230252,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,"It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in."
186840,L230251,u5455,m363,NICKY,Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
186841,L230250,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
186842,L230249,u5455,m363,NICKY,I'm on my way to get a haircut.
186843,L230248,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,"If it's you, what are you doing here?"
186844,L230247,u5455,m363,NICKY,Where are your glasses? Go get them.
186845,L230246,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,Nicky comes on Sunday's.
186846,L230245,u5455,m363,NICKY,It's me. Nicky.
186847,L230244,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,What do you want?
186848,L230243,u5455,m363,NICKY,Right here. At the door.
186849,L230242,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,Where the hell are you?
186850,L230241,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Pop, will you let me in?"
186851,L230240,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,Go way. I'll call a cop.
186852,L230239,u5455,m363,NICKY,I'm at the door.
186853,L230238,u5454,m363,MICHAEL,Who is it?
186854,L230495,u5455,m363,NICKY,This could be it!
186855,L230494,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,This could be it!
186856,L230480,u5455,m363,NICKY,It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
186857,L230479,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Don't worry. It's a test.
186858,L230471,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Because faith is rewarded.
186859,L230470,u5455,m363,NICKY,Because life is good.
186860,L230469,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Washed away.
186861,L230468,u5455,m363,NICKY,All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
186862,L230466,u5455,m363,NICKY,He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
186863,L230465,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Because God loves a winner.
186864,L230464,u5455,m363,NICKY,"This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why."
186865,L230450,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Matthew.
186866,L230449,u5455,m363,NICKY,I don't know.
186867,L230444,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
186868,L230443,u5455,m363,NICKY,Life is good.
186869,L230442,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Then say it.
186870,L230441,u5455,m363,NICKY,I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
186871,L230440,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
186872,L230435,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,"If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down."
186873,L230434,u5455,m363,NICKY,I want to believe.
186874,L230433,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
186875,L230432,u5455,m363,NICKY,"""It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."""
186876,L230431,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
186877,L230428,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
186878,L230427,u5455,m363,NICKY,Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
186879,L230426,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
186880,L230380,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,It's a simple subject.
186881,L230379,u5455,m363,NICKY,It's a complicated subject.
186882,L230378,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
186883,L230377,u5455,m363,NICKY,I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
186884,L230376,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,"An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?"
186885,L230375,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?"
186886,L230374,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,"You're a family man, Frankie?"
186887,L230372,u5455,m363,NICKY,It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
186888,L230371,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,"Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once."
186889,L230360,u5455,m363,NICKY,"That's my cousin, Angelo."
186890,L230359,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
186891,L230358,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question."
186892,L230357,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,You're charming the boy.
186893,L230356,u5455,m363,NICKY,What am I doing?
186894,L230355,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,"You see what you're doing, don't you?"
186895,L230348,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball."
186896,L230347,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,That's a simple subject.
186897,L230346,u5455,m363,NICKY,Now that's a complicated subject.
186898,L230345,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
186899,L230344,u5455,m363,NICKY,It's the kid's lucky day.
186900,L230343,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,"He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before."
186901,L230342,u5455,m363,NICKY,A grandmother. God bless you.
186902,L230341,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Matthew's my grandson.
186903,L230340,u5455,m363,NICKY,How come you got the kid with you?
186904,L230339,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
186905,L230338,u5455,m363,NICKY,Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
186906,L230337,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,"The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?"
186907,L230336,u5455,m363,NICKY,Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
186908,L230335,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,"Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?"
186909,L230334,u5455,m363,NICKY,Oh yeah?
186910,L230333,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
186911,L230332,u5455,m363,NICKY,Everybody else does. Why not you?
186912,L230331,u5461,m363,TOYOTA,I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
186913,L230594,u5460,m363,STEVEN,You're out of bullets.
186914,L230593,u5455,m363,NICKY,And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
186915,L230586,u5455,m363,NICKY,What about my play?
186916,L230585,u5460,m363,STEVEN,"When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates."
186917,L230584,u5455,m363,NICKY,I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
186918,L230583,u5460,m363,STEVEN,"Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore."
186919,L230582,u5455,m363,NICKY,"If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night."
186920,L230581,u5460,m363,STEVEN,The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
186921,L230580,u5455,m363,NICKY,I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
186922,L230579,u5460,m363,STEVEN,"They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'"
186923,L230578,u5455,m363,NICKY,No. They're not your team. They're my team.
186924,L230577,u5460,m363,STEVEN,They're my team.
186925,L230576,u5455,m363,NICKY,Why do you care?
186926,L230575,u5460,m363,STEVEN,"If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over."
186927,L230574,u5455,m363,NICKY,Why does it matter?
186928,L230573,u5460,m363,STEVEN,Then they lost?
186929,L230142,u5459,m363,SIDNEY,You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
186930,L230141,u5455,m363,NICKY,"I've had three straight washouts, Sidney."
186931,L230140,u5459,m363,SIDNEY,Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
186932,L230139,u5455,m363,NICKY,Postpone. We have every right.
186933,L230138,u5459,m363,SIDNEY,Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
186934,L230137,u5455,m363,NICKY,'m not worried about this kid.
186935,L230136,u5459,m363,SIDNEY,So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
186936,L230135,u5455,m363,NICKY,hat was this morning.
186937,L230134,u5459,m363,SIDNEY,"I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said."
186938,L230133,u5455,m363,NICKY,"appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play."
186939,L230132,u5459,m363,SIDNEY,Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
186940,L230131,u5455,m363,NICKY,aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
186941,L230515,u5455,m363,NICKY,You're not making sense.
186942,L230514,u5458,m363,SECOND MAN,"Game six is history,pal."
186943,L230509,u5455,m363,NICKY,Eleventh inning. What else?
186944,L230508,u5458,m363,SECOND MAN,Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
186945,L230507,u5455,m363,NICKY,Have to hurry back.
186946,L230064,u5455,m363,NICKY,"When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate."
186947,L230063,u5458,m363,SECOND MAN,How come?
186948,L230062,u5455,m363,NICKY,I hate the Mets.
186949,L230457,u5462,m363,WAITER,"But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --"
186950,L230456,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know ""Macbeth""."
186951,L230394,u5455,m363,NICKY,Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
186952,L230393,u5462,m363,WAITER,"Yessiree, Bob."
186953,L230073,u5462,m363,WAITER,Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
186954,L230072,u5455,m363,NICKY,Why?
186955,L230071,u5462,m363,WAITER,"To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding."
186956,L230070,u5455,m363,NICKY,What do you mean?
186957,L230175,u5457,m363,PETER,I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
186958,L230174,u5455,m363,NICKY,This could be it.
186959,L230171,u5457,m363,PETER,"That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it."
186960,L230170,u5455,m363,NICKY,And the Father replies?
186961,L230162,u5457,m363,PETER,I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
186962,L230161,u5455,m363,NICKY,Yes.
186963,L230160,u5457,m363,PETER,I kissed her while she was laughing.
186964,L230159,u5455,m363,NICKY,Yes.
186965,L230158,u5457,m363,PETER,"This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it."
186966,L230157,u5455,m363,NICKY,Mine was cobalt blue.
186967,L230156,u5457,m363,PETER,Burnt sienna.
186968,L230155,u5455,m363,NICKY,"What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?"
186969,L230154,u5457,m363,PETER,What color?
186970,L230153,u5455,m363,NICKY,You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
186971,L230152,u5457,m363,PETER,But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
186972,L230151,u5455,m363,NICKY,"Yes, Peter."
186973,L230150,u5457,m363,PETER,I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
186974,L230149,u5455,m363,NICKY,Yes.
186975,L230148,u5457,m363,PETER,I have excellent long-term memory.
186976,L230147,u5455,m363,NICKY,Yes.
186977,L230146,u5457,m363,PETER,I was educated by nuns.
186978,L230145,u5455,m363,NICKY,Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
186979,L230144,u5457,m363,PETER,Sidney.
186980,L230143,u5455,m363,NICKY,Sidney remains optimistic.
186981,L230202,u5455,m363,NICKY,I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
186982,L230201,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
186983,L230198,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,He goes to the theater armed.
186984,L230197,u5455,m363,NICKY,Yes.
186985,L230196,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Our Steven not only disguises himself.
186986,L230195,u5455,m363,NICKY,"What? Come on, Paisley."
186987,L230194,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Never mind.
186988,L230193,u5455,m363,NICKY,Yes.
186989,L230192,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
186990,L230191,u5455,m363,NICKY,I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
186991,L230190,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
186992,L230189,u5455,m363,NICKY,So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
186993,L230188,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,"If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?"
186994,L230187,u5455,m363,NICKY,There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
186995,L230186,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,No one's waiting.
186996,L230185,u5455,m363,NICKY,Someone waiting for you?
186997,L230184,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Home.
186998,L230183,u5455,m363,NICKY,Where are you going now?
186999,L230182,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,He's a very sweet man.
187000,L230181,u5455,m363,NICKY,I don't know.
187001,L230180,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Do you think he can do it?
187002,L230129,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,"Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play."
187003,L230128,u5455,m363,NICKY,But you're his friend.
187004,L230127,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
187005,L230126,u5455,m363,NICKY,He wears a disguise.
187006,L230125,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Is what true?
187007,L230124,u5455,m363,NICKY,Is it true?
187008,L230123,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,"The fact is, I have to get going."
187009,L230122,u5455,m363,NICKY,I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
187010,L230121,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
187011,L230120,u5455,m363,NICKY,Would you like to meet him?
187012,L230119,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
187013,L230118,u5455,m363,NICKY,So do I. Over and over.
187014,L230117,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,I hear good things about the new play.
187015,L230116,u5455,m363,NICKY,"I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world."
187016,L230115,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,"I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows."
187017,L230114,u5455,m363,NICKY,You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
187018,L230097,u5455,m363,NICKY,One more time.
187019,L230096,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Alla puttanesca.
187020,L230095,u5455,m363,NICKY,You know what.
187021,L230094,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,What?
187022,L230093,u5455,m363,NICKY,Say it again.
187023,L230092,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,A little drastic maybe?
187024,L230091,u5455,m363,NICKY,Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
187025,L230090,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Engaging.
187026,L230089,u5455,m363,NICKY,Endearing.
187027,L230088,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
187028,L230087,u5455,m363,NICKY,And he has finer moments now and then.
187029,L230086,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,A little.
187030,L230085,u5455,m363,NICKY,Oh. You know him.
187031,L230084,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Not one of Steven's finer moments.
187032,L230083,u5455,m363,NICKY,So does Elliot.
187033,L230082,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,I think I remember.
187034,L230081,u5455,m363,NICKY,There was a review.
187035,L230080,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
187036,L230079,u5455,m363,NICKY,You've worked with Elliot?
187037,L230055,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
187038,L230054,u5455,m363,NICKY,What's good?
187039,L230215,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,I'm going home to my machine.
187040,L230214,u5460,m363,STEVEN,Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
187041,L230213,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,"I don't want you, Steven."
187042,L230212,u5460,m363,STEVEN,"And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me."
187043,L230211,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
187044,L230210,u5460,m363,STEVEN,The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
187045,L230209,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
187046,L230208,u5460,m363,STEVEN,"Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs."
187047,L230207,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,"In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair."
187048,L230206,u5460,m363,STEVEN,But you're here. So you must have come to me.
187049,L230205,u5456,m363,PAISLEY,I haven't come to you.
187050,L230204,u5460,m363,STEVEN,You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
187051,L231299,u5463,m364,BA,"""I will follow you in all our vows and duties."""
187052,L231298,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"""Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."""
187053,L231297,u5463,m364,BA,"""I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."""
187054,L231296,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"""Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."""
187055,L231200,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Eleven.
187056,L231199,u5463,m364,BA,God gave you ten thumbs.
187057,L230911,u5467,m364,GANDHI,There's no room! And the air is lovely.
187058,L230910,u5463,m364,BA,Please! You're being foolish!
187059,L230760,u5467,m364,GANDHI,All the more reason.
187060,L230759,u5463,m364,BA,I am your wife.
187061,L230758,u5467,m364,GANDHI,In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
187062,L230757,u5463,m364,BA,It is the work of untouchables.
187063,L230756,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Everyone takes his turn.
187064,L230755,u5463,m364,BA,Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
187065,L230686,u5463,m364,BA,Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
187066,L230685,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Oww!
187067,L230683,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Yes -- I can't talk like this.
187068,L230682,u5463,m364,BA,Are you sure?
187069,L230681,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- ""a monstrous attack."""
187070,L230679,u5463,m364,BA,They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
187071,L230678,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
187072,L230671,u5463,m364,BA,As I told you about English policemen.
187073,L230670,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"""A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest."" -- I told you about English law."
187074,L231568,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man."
187075,L231567,u5464,m364,BOURKE-WHITE,Just an admirer...
187076,L231565,u5464,m364,BOURKE-WHITE,One more.
187077,L231564,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Enough.
187078,L231560,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought."
187079,L231559,u5464,m364,BOURKE-WHITE,"You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man."
187080,L231432,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
187081,L231431,u5464,m364,BOURKE-WHITE,What do you expect when you talk like that?
187082,L231430,u5467,m364,GANDHI,No. That is what you get for distracting me.
187083,L231429,u5464,m364,BOURKE-WHITE,Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
187084,L231428,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
187085,L231427,u5464,m364,BOURKE-WHITE,But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
187086,L231423,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison."
187087,L231422,u5464,m364,BOURKE-WHITE,"""...what shape it will take."" Jinnah has -- what?"
187088,L231420,u5464,m364,BOURKE-WHITE,Stop!
187089,L231419,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --"
187090,L231021,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"It does. We must be getting old, Charlie."
187091,L231020,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,"They're calling you ""Bapu."" I thought it meant father."
187092,L231018,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,"Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display."
187093,L231017,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
187094,L231016,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
187095,L231015,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them."
187096,L231012,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,Did they take your clothes?
187097,L231011,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Not quite. They're only ""holding me"" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison."
187098,L230918,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,Going nearer to God!
187099,L230917,u5467,m364,GANDHI,What are you doing?
187100,L230913,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
187101,L230912,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,"No violence, please."
187102,L230727,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Well, we shall try."
187103,L230726,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,"That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this ""farm""..."
187104,L230724,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
187105,L230723,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I thought you were a man of God.
187106,L230722,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,That was lucky.
187107,L230708,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Not anymore.  At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or --"
187108,L230707,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,"Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?"
187109,L230706,u5467,m364,GANDHI,You're a clergyman.
187110,L230704,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Some of it good, I hope."
187111,L230703,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,"I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you."
187112,L230702,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I'm sorry.
187113,L230701,u5465,m364,CHARLIE,You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
187114,L231349,u5477,m364,WALKER,He said he's in charge...
187115,L231348,u5466,m364,COLLINS,What'd he say?
187116,L231292,u5466,m364,COLLINS,"Well, he must've found some of the answers..."
187117,L231291,u5477,m364,WALKER,Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
187118,L231290,u5466,m364,COLLINS,What was he like?
187119,L231289,u5477,m364,WALKER,Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
187120,L231288,u5466,m364,COLLINS,You mean Gandhi?
187121,L231285,u5477,m364,WALKER,"Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time."
187122,L231284,u5466,m364,COLLINS,How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
187123,L231283,u5477,m364,WALKER,...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
187124,L230624,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"No, no -- just a moment, please."
187125,L230623,u5474,m364,PORTER,"I'll take your luggage back, baas."
187126,L230617,u5474,m364,PORTER,"Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --"
187127,L230616,u5467,m364,GANDHI,A -- a week.
187128,L230615,u5474,m364,PORTER,"Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?"
187129,L230614,u5467,m364,GANDHI,No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
187130,L230613,u5474,m364,PORTER,"""Hell!"""
187131,L230612,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Tell me -- do you think about hell?
187132,L231528,u5467,m364,GANDHI,That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
187133,L231527,u5472,m364,NEHRU,What do you want?
187134,L231400,u5472,m364,NEHRU,I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
187135,L231399,u5467,m364,GANDHI,They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
187136,L231341,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Wait and see... wait and see...
187137,L231340,u5472,m364,NEHRU,He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
187138,L231339,u5467,m364,GANDHI,And Jinnah?
187139,L231266,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Panditji -- please, help me."
187140,L231265,u5472,m364,NEHRU,I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
187141,L231239,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
187142,L231238,u5472,m364,NEHRU,It was one incident.
187143,L231237,u5467,m364,GANDHI,If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
187144,L231232,u5467,m364,GANDHI,We must end the campaign.
187145,L231231,u5472,m364,NEHRU,What can we do?
187146,L231115,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I've never spoken for anything else.
187147,L231114,u5472,m364,NEHRU,"The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence."
187148,L231113,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
187149,L231098,u5472,m364,NEHRU,I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
187150,L231097,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
187151,L230959,u5472,m364,NEHRU,I thought you were against fighting.
187152,L230958,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere."
187153,L231351,u5477,m364,WALKER,My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
187154,L231350,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Are you going to walk all the way?
187155,L231345,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
187156,L231344,u5477,m364,WALKER,Is it over if they arrest you now?
187157,L231343,u5477,m364,WALKER,It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
187158,L231342,u5467,m364,GANDHI,You've done me a great service.
187159,L231313,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped."
187160,L231312,u5477,m364,WALKER,A great deal.
187161,L231311,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Do you remember much of South Africa?
187162,L231310,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
187163,L231309,u5477,m364,WALKER,Hm.  Is it?
187164,L231308,u5467,m364,GANDHI,And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
187165,L231306,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Even as a boy I thought so.
187166,L231305,u5477,m364,WALKER,It's beautiful.
187167,L230748,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I hope not.
187168,L230747,u5477,m364,WALKER,You're an ambitious man.
187169,L230746,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"That's right. The word only means ""community."" But it could stand for ""village""... or the world."
187170,L230745,u5477,m364,WALKER,"Well, it's quite a place, your ""ashram"" -- is that right?"
187171,L230741,u5467,m364,GANDHI,There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
187172,L230740,u5477,m364,WALKER,You will respect the law.
187173,L230739,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"I don't know... I'm still searching for a ""response."""
187174,L230738,u5477,m364,WALKER,"Hm. And what should an ""important professional"" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?"
187175,L230737,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.
187176,L231550,u5471,m364,MIRABEHN,No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
187177,L231549,u5467,m364,GANDHI,It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
187178,L231336,u5471,m364,MIRABEHN,You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
187179,L231335,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
187180,L231252,u5471,m364,MIRABEHN,I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
187181,L231251,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Do you find me stubborn?
187182,L231220,u5467,m364,GANDHI,First spin. Let the others march for a time.
187183,L231219,u5471,m364,MIRABEHN,I would rather march.
187184,L231218,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
187185,L231217,u5471,m364,MIRABEHN,It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
187186,L231451,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master."
187187,L231450,u5469,m364,JINNAH,I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
187188,L231234,u5467,m364,GANDHI,An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
187189,L231233,u5469,m364,JINNAH,After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
187190,L231092,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop."
187191,L231091,u5469,m364,JINNAH,You mean a general strike?
187192,L231070,u5469,m364,JINNAH,I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
187193,L231069,u5467,m364,GANDHI,The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.
187194,L230886,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I --
187195,L230885,u5469,m364,JINNAH,"We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi."
187196,L231492,u5467,m364,GANDHI,There is nothing I can give.
187197,L231491,u5473,m364,PATEL,We need your help!
187198,L231403,u5473,m364,PATEL,That's when you take advantage.
187199,L231402,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger."
187200,L231204,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
187201,L231203,u5473,m364,PATEL,It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
187202,L231076,u5473,m364,PATEL,"Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious..."
187203,L231075,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
187204,L230878,u5467,m364,GANDHI,No.
187205,L230877,u5473,m364,PATEL,"Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore."
187206,L230876,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel."
187207,L230875,u5473,m364,PATEL,I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
187208,L230874,u5473,m364,PATEL,"That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something."
187209,L230873,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Who is that young man?
187210,L230819,u5470,m364,KHAN,Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
187211,L230818,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"If we hold firm, it won't be the last."
187212,L230817,u5470,m364,KHAN,"Well, that's one victory."
187213,L230816,u5467,m364,GANDHI,It's split the Government.
187214,L230815,u5470,m364,KHAN,The fools!  Sorry...
187215,L230814,u5467,m364,GANDHI,My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
187216,L230813,u5470,m364,KHAN,I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
187217,L230811,u5467,m364,GANDHI,So did I.
187218,L230810,u5470,m364,KHAN,No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
187219,L230809,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"They're sparing no one, I see."
187220,L230643,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
187221,L230642,u5470,m364,KHAN,Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
187222,L230641,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else."
187223,L230640,u5470,m364,KHAN,"I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less ""holy"" than Mr. Baker."
187224,L230639,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?"
187225,L230634,u5470,m364,KHAN,That was England.
187226,L230633,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"In England, I was a poor student but I --"
187227,L230845,u5476,m364,SMUTS,Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
187228,L230844,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
187229,L230843,u5476,m364,SMUTS,All right. Fine.
187230,L230842,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
187231,L230841,u5476,m364,SMUTS,Assuming we are in agreement?
187232,L230839,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
187233,L230838,u5476,m364,SMUTS,You're an extraordinary man.
187234,L230835,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I congratulate them.
187235,L230834,u5476,m364,SMUTS,"Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to ""investigate"" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed."
187236,L230833,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Very well.
187237,L230832,u5476,m364,SMUTS,I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
187238,L230831,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Somehow I expected not.
187239,L230830,u5476,m364,SMUTS,Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
187240,L230829,u5467,m364,GANDHI,"Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done."
187241,L230828,u5476,m364,SMUTS,"Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such ""exception"" to."
187242,L230826,u5476,m364,SMUTS,Ahh.
187243,L230825,u5467,m364,GANDHI,I dined at the prison.
187244,L230824,u5476,m364,SMUTS,Perhaps some tea?
187245,L230823,u5467,m364,GANDHI,Thank you. No.
187246,L230822,u5476,m364,SMUTS,Will you have a glass of sherry?
187247,L231377,u5468,m364,IRWIN,"Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail."
187248,L231376,u5475,m364,SENIOR POLICE OFFICER,"Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works."
187249,L231375,u5468,m364,IRWIN,"He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?"
187250,L231369,u5475,m364,SENIOR POLICE OFFICER,"I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother."
187251,L231368,u5468,m364,IRWIN,Who's leading them?
187252,L231367,u5475,m364,SENIOR POLICE OFFICER,"...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on."
187253,L231327,u5475,m364,SENIOR POLICE OFFICER,"Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of ""Free India."" Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt."
187254,L231326,u5468,m364,IRWIN,"And that's the basis of this ""Declaration of Independence""?"
187255,L231489,u5472,m364,NEHRU,Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
187256,L231488,u5473,m364,PATEL,Could we cut all news off? I know --
187257,L231485,u5473,m364,PATEL,...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
187258,L231484,u5472,m364,NEHRU,"In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan."
187259,L231480,u5473,m364,PATEL,Have you found him?
187260,L231479,u5472,m364,NEHRU,He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
187261,L231468,u5473,m364,PATEL,"If you did this, no one could control it. No one."
187262,L231467,u5472,m364,NEHRU,"Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away."
187263,L230946,u5473,m364,PATEL,No -- but I think I'm going to.
187264,L230945,u5472,m364,NEHRU,Have you read his magazine?
187265,L230908,u5472,m364,NEHRU,"He's ""discovering"" India."
187266,L230907,u5473,m364,PATEL,Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
187267,L232132,u5489,m365,JEROME,Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
187268,L232131,u5478,m365,ANTON,"Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!"
187269,L232130,u5489,m365,JEROME,Now is your chance to find out.
187270,L232129,u5478,m365,ANTON,"How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?"
187271,L232119,u5478,m365,ANTON,"I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight."
187272,L232118,u5489,m365,JEROME,Who are you trying to convince?
187273,L232117,u5478,m365,ANTON,You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
187274,L232116,u5489,m365,JEROME,Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
187275,L232115,u5489,m365,JEROME,"God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once."
187276,L232114,u5478,m365,ANTON,It's for the best.
187277,L232113,u5489,m365,JEROME,"Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?"
187278,L232112,u5478,m365,ANTON,It's over.
187279,L232111,u5489,m365,JEROME,There are a few million miles to go yet.
187280,L232110,u5478,m365,ANTON,"Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go."
187281,L232109,u5489,m365,JEROME,You almost sound like you believe that.
187282,L231628,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
187283,L231627,u5479,m365,ANTONIO,"I'm sorry, there's no way we can."
187284,L231626,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,It would be five thousand more.
187285,L231625,u5479,m365,ANTONIO,How much extra?
187286,L231619,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,"I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time."
187287,L231618,u5479,m365,ANTONIO,I like football.
187288,L231617,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,"Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage."
187289,L231616,u5479,m365,ANTONIO,"Er, no..."
187290,L231615,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
187291,L231614,u5479,m365,ANTONIO,"He's right, Maria.  That's right."
187292,L231613,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,"You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result."
187293,L231612,u5479,m365,ANTONIO,We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
187294,L232102,u5480,m365,CAESAR,I'll take care of it.
187295,L232101,u5489,m365,JEROME,"By the way, I left some trash in your locker."
187296,L232100,u5480,m365,CAESAR,"And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know."
187297,L232099,u5489,m365,JEROME,I'll see what I can do.
187298,L232098,u5480,m365,CAESAR,"I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit."
187299,L232097,u5489,m365,JEROME,I guess I'm a slow learner.
187300,L232096,u5480,m365,CAESAR,No?  What's keeping you?
187301,L232095,u5489,m365,JEROME,"Not yet, I'm afraid."
187302,L232094,u5480,m365,CAESAR,"So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent."
187303,L232092,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,Where did you get this?
187304,L232091,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
187305,L232084,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,Luca could still be an accomplice.
187306,L232083,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
187307,L232038,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission."
187308,L232037,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
187309,L232021,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
187310,L232020,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,Where do we start?
187311,L232019,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,What are you waiting for?
187312,L231967,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
187313,L231966,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,From what budget?
187314,L231965,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"Get it.  From outside, if you have to."
187315,L231964,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,We don't have the manpower.
187316,L231963,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again."
187317,L231962,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
187318,L231961,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,Something's not right.
187319,L231960,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,That's the last.
187320,L231939,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,Blood.  From the vein.
187321,L231938,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
187322,L231937,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
187323,L231936,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
187324,L231935,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,Don't underestimate these imposters.
187325,L231934,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals."
187326,L231933,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
187327,L231932,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window."
187328,L231931,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"Of course.  He's a ""de-gene-erate"".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder."
187329,L231929,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"No.  But one or two ""borrowed ladders"" have shown up there in the past."
187330,L231928,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
187331,L231927,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
187332,L231889,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets."
187333,L231888,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
187334,L231887,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
187335,L231886,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky."
187336,L231885,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?"
187337,L231884,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet."
187338,L231883,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it ""likely"" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?"
187339,L231882,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
187340,L231881,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
187341,L231805,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself."
187342,L231804,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,What a pity.
187343,L231803,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
187344,L231802,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
187345,L231801,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"Who knows with these ""deficients""?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence."
187346,L231800,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
187347,L231798,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
187348,L231797,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?"
187349,L231796,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
187350,L231795,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes."
187351,L231794,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,--What <i>about</i> his profile?
187352,L231793,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--"
187353,L231792,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"No, <i>this</i> is your man."
187354,L231791,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives."
187355,L231790,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,Grudges?
187356,L231789,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges..."
187357,L231788,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"A man's dead, Detective."
187358,L231787,u5481,m365,DETECTIVE HUGO,"I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this."
187359,L232049,u5482,m365,DIRECTOR JOSEF,I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
187360,L232048,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,At least it's nothing contagious.
187361,L232040,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,This time I will supervise each test personally.
187362,L232039,u5482,m365,DIRECTOR JOSEF,Twelve have a mission within the week.
187363,L231973,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt."
187364,L231972,u5482,m365,DIRECTOR JOSEF,"Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place."
187365,L231971,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
187366,L231970,u5482,m365,DIRECTOR JOSEF,One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
187367,L231969,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"Thank you, no."
187368,L231968,u5482,m365,DIRECTOR JOSEF,Would you care to look--in the telescope?
187369,L231821,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
187370,L231820,u5482,m365,DIRECTOR JOSEF,What a relief.
187371,L231819,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,We believe we have a suspect.
187372,L231817,u5482,m365,DIRECTOR JOSEF,"We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around."
187373,L231816,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,Surely you know what you have.
187374,L231815,u5482,m365,DIRECTOR JOSEF,Often.
187375,L231814,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"How often do you test, Director?"
187376,L232127,u5483,m365,EUGENE,You have more in common than you know.
187377,L232126,u5488,m365,IRENE,What's wrong with him?
187378,L232125,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do."
187379,L232124,u5483,m365,EUGENE,He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
187380,L232123,u5488,m365,IRENE,I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
187381,L232122,u5483,m365,EUGENE,That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
187382,L232064,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Again?
187383,L232063,u5488,m365,IRENE,It's about the Director.
187384,L232062,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your ""friends""?"
187385,L232061,u5488,m365,IRENE,Good to see you're feeling better.
187386,L232059,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up."
187387,L232058,u5488,m365,IRENE,Jerome--?
187388,L232057,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Hello.
187389,L231685,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it."
187390,L231684,u5493,m365,VINCENT,"I don't know exactly, Jerome."
187391,L231683,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?"
187392,L231682,u5493,m365,VINCENT,German.
187393,L231681,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?"
187394,L231680,u5493,m365,VINCENT,Suit yourself.
187395,L231679,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>."
187396,L231678,u5493,m365,VINCENT,What's wrong with it?
187397,L231677,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
187398,L231676,u5493,m365,VINCENT,"You okay, Jerome?"
187399,L231672,u5493,m365,VINCENT,He's too tall.
187400,L231671,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Six one.
187401,L231670,u5493,m365,VINCENT,"Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?"
187402,L232150,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
187403,L232149,u5489,m365,JEROME,Thank you.
187404,L232148,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I'm travelling too.
187405,L232147,u5489,m365,JEROME,Where are you going?
187406,L232146,u5483,m365,EUGENE,In case you get back before I do.
187407,L232145,u5489,m365,JEROME,Why have you done this?
187408,L232142,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"No, but you might need them when you get back."
187409,L232141,u5489,m365,JEROME,Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
187410,L232140,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I have your samples ready.
187411,L232080,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
187412,L232079,u5489,m365,JEROME,How the hell did you get here.
187413,L232078,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"Not bad, Jerome."
187414,L232077,u5489,m365,JEROME,"How are you, Jerome?"
187415,L232054,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"I was never very good at it, remember?"
187416,L232053,u5489,m365,JEROME,How would you like to be yourself for the day?
187417,L232052,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Hello?
187418,L231989,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
187419,L231988,u5489,m365,JEROME,"By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, ""How are you?""  Forty-five minutes later I reply, ""Not bad.  How are you?"""
187420,L231987,u5483,m365,EUGENE,How long?
187421,L231986,u5489,m365,JEROME,We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
187422,L231985,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself."
187423,L231984,u5489,m365,JEROME,Will you be okay?
187424,L231983,u5483,m365,EUGENE,You may as well invite her here.
187425,L231982,u5489,m365,JEROME,Everybody goes there.
187426,L231981,u5489,m365,JEROME,Michael's.
187427,L231980,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Where are you taking her?
187428,L231979,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
187429,L231978,u5489,m365,JEROME,She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
187430,L231977,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Again?
187431,L231976,u5489,m365,JEROME,I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
187432,L231975,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Where are we going?
187433,L231926,u5483,m365,EUGENE,She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
187434,L231925,u5489,m365,JEROME,Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
187435,L231924,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"You're not thinking of telling her, are you?"
187436,L231923,u5489,m365,JEROME,You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
187437,L231922,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to ""breed up"".  What's wrong with her?"
187438,L231921,u5489,m365,JEROME,Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
187439,L231920,u5483,m365,EUGENE,How was your evening?
187440,L231874,u5483,m365,EUGENE,If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
187441,L231873,u5489,m365,JEROME,Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
187442,L231872,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
187443,L231871,u5489,m365,JEROME,Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
187444,L231870,u5489,m365,JEROME,Good choice.
187445,L231869,u5483,m365,EUGENE,If you say so.  The stripe.
187446,L231868,u5489,m365,JEROME,I've got enough on my mind without that.
187447,L231867,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Is that all?
187448,L231866,u5489,m365,JEROME,You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
187449,L231865,u5483,m365,EUGENE,So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
187450,L231863,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I'm sure I could have.
187451,L231862,u5489,m365,JEROME,You really had other offers?
187452,L231860,u5489,m365,JEROME,I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
187453,L231859,u5483,m365,EUGENE,And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
187454,L231858,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned."
187455,L231857,u5489,m365,JEROME,They'll recognize me.
187456,L231856,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years."
187457,L231855,u5489,m365,JEROME,"--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses."
187458,L231854,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
187459,L231853,u5489,m365,JEROME,Come on--we're taking off.
187460,L231852,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
187461,L231851,u5489,m365,JEROME,In a corridor.
187462,L231850,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Where?
187463,L231849,u5489,m365,JEROME,They found my eyelash.
187464,L231848,u5483,m365,EUGENE,What makes them think that?
187465,L231847,u5489,m365,JEROME,They think I offed the Director.
187466,L231846,u5483,m365,EUGENE,What are you talking about?
187467,L231845,u5489,m365,JEROME,We can't stay here.
187468,L231844,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Any particular reason?
187469,L231843,u5489,m365,JEROME,Call German.
187470,L231785,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"I'm proud of you, Vincent."
187471,L231784,u5489,m365,JEROME,It's all right.
187472,L231783,u5483,m365,EUGENE,--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
187473,L231782,u5489,m365,JEROME,--What car?--Go to sleep.
187474,L231781,u5483,m365,EUGENE,You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
187475,L231780,u5489,m365,JEROME,"It's okay, Eugene."
187476,L231779,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
187477,L231771,u5483,m365,EUGENE,You know I'm scared of heights.
187478,L231770,u5489,m365,JEROME,Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
187479,L231768,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life."
187480,L231767,u5489,m365,JEROME,A day or so.
187481,L231766,u5483,m365,EUGENE,How long do you stay up there before you go?
187482,L231765,u5489,m365,JEROME,11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.
187483,L231764,u5483,m365,EUGENE,What <i>is</i> that one?
187484,L231763,u5489,m365,JEROME,And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
187485,L231762,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?"
187486,L231760,u5489,m365,JEROME,Keep going!!  Keep going!!
187487,L231759,u5483,m365,EUGENE,I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
187488,L231757,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going."
187489,L231756,u5489,m365,JEROME,Let's get out of here.
187490,L231744,u5489,m365,JEROME,You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
187491,L231743,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the ""J. Edgars"" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately."
187492,L231742,u5489,m365,JEROME,That's not the point.
187493,L231741,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?"
187494,L231740,u5489,m365,JEROME,The place is crawling with Hoovers.
187495,L231739,u5483,m365,EUGENE,This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
187496,L231738,u5489,m365,JEROME,He was still warm when they confirmed.
187497,L231737,u5483,m365,EUGENE,What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
187498,L231736,u5489,m365,JEROME,They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
187499,L231735,u5483,m365,EUGENE,You wish.
187500,L231734,u5489,m365,JEROME,The Mission Director.
187501,L231733,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Who died?
187502,L231703,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent."
187503,L231702,u5489,m365,JEROME,"What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?"
187504,L231701,u5483,m365,EUGENE,You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
187505,L231700,u5489,m365,JEROME,It's not too late to back out.
187506,L231699,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"God, you're serious, aren't you?"
187507,L231698,u5489,m365,JEROME,Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
187508,L231697,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?"
187509,L231696,u5489,m365,JEROME,<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
187510,L231695,u5483,m365,EUGENE,You really need that much?
187511,L231693,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Noone orders southpaws anymore.
187512,L231692,u5489,m365,JEROME,You had to be a right-hander.
187513,L231691,u5483,m365,EUGENE,It needs work.
187514,L231690,u5483,m365,EUGENE,Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
187515,L231689,u5489,m365,JEROME,What about this?
187516,L231688,u5483,m365,EUGENE,"If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome."
187517,L231687,u5489,m365,JEROME,I have to know where you come from.
187518,L231630,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,"They are not babies, Maria, merely ""human possibilities""."
187519,L231629,u5491,m365,MARIA,What will happen to the others?
187520,L231624,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
187521,L231623,u5491,m365,MARIA,"Antonio, the choir..."
187522,L231622,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
187523,L231621,u5491,m365,MARIA,We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
187524,L231620,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,Anything I've forgotten?
187525,L231611,u5491,m365,MARIA,"--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes."
187526,L231610,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,"You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--"
187527,L231609,u5491,m365,MARIA,"We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with."
187528,L231608,u5484,m365,GENETICIST,"First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?"
187529,L231675,u5485,m365,GERMAN,There's a way.
187530,L231674,u5493,m365,VINCENT,Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
187531,L231673,u5485,m365,GERMAN,You can wear lifts.
187532,L231668,u5493,m365,VINCENT,How tall are you?
187533,L231667,u5485,m365,GERMAN,"Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee."
187534,L231666,u5493,m365,VINCENT,I'd have to bleach my hair.
187535,L231665,u5485,m365,GERMAN,Yeah.
187536,L231664,u5493,m365,VINCENT,That's the hair color in his profile?
187537,L231663,u5485,m365,GERMAN,
187538,L231661,u5485,m365,GERMAN,"It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life."
187539,L231660,u5493,m365,VINCENT,How do I square the accident?
187540,L231659,u5485,m365,GERMAN,"No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--"
187541,L231658,u5493,m365,VINCENT,I hope he's not just a body.
187542,L231657,u5485,m365,GERMAN,"He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star."
187543,L231656,u5485,m365,GERMAN,"Vincent, come down.  I've found him."
187544,L231655,u5493,m365,VINCENT,"German, is that you?"
187545,L231654,u5485,m365,GERMAN,Vincent...Vincent...
187546,L231651,u5485,m365,GERMAN,I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
187547,L231650,u5493,m365,VINCENT,What do you think?
187548,L232090,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,A fingerprint.  There's something to be said for nostalgia.  What did you find?
187549,L232089,u5486,m365,HUGO,I've found him too.
187550,L232088,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,Hugo!  I've found him!
187551,L232035,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,"They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving."
187552,L232034,u5486,m365,HUGO,Not that.
187553,L232033,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,You worried about the cost?
187554,L232032,u5486,m365,HUGO,These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
187555,L232031,u5487,m365,INVESTIGATOR,Why not?
187556,L232030,u5486,m365,HUGO,My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
187557,L232139,u5488,m365,IRENE,Not so long--just once around the sun.
187558,L232138,u5489,m365,JEROME,A year is a long time.
187559,L232045,u5489,m365,JEROME,We could go together one day.
187560,L232044,u5488,m365,IRENE,--when you go away.
187561,L232042,u5489,m365,JEROME,I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
187562,L232041,u5488,m365,IRENE,What is it?
187563,L232029,u5489,m365,JEROME,That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
187564,L232028,u5488,m365,IRENE,You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
187565,L232027,u5489,m365,JEROME,"But ""if it came to it"" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?"
187566,L232026,u5488,m365,IRENE,"So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it."
187567,L232025,u5489,m365,JEROME,You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
187568,L232024,u5488,m365,IRENE,What happened?
187569,L232006,u5489,m365,JEROME,"We'll get it later.  Irene, please."
187570,L232005,u5488,m365,IRENE,My medication.  I left it back there.
187571,L232004,u5489,m365,JEROME,Come on.
187572,L232003,u5488,m365,IRENE,I can't.
187573,L232002,u5489,m365,JEROME,It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
187574,L232001,u5488,m365,IRENE,Who are they?
187575,L232000,u5489,m365,JEROME,Let's walk.
187576,L231999,u5488,m365,IRENE,What about the car?
187577,L231997,u5489,m365,JEROME,Those checks take forever.
187578,L231996,u5488,m365,IRENE,Why are we leaving?
187579,L231991,u5489,m365,JEROME,You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
187580,L231990,u5488,m365,IRENE,What <i>is</i> this place?
187581,L231959,u5489,m365,JEROME,I guess somebody beat me to it.
187582,L231958,u5488,m365,IRENE,So you didn't do it after all.
187583,L231919,u5489,m365,JEROME,Of course.
187584,L231918,u5488,m365,IRENE,Of course I think about it every day.
187585,L231917,u5488,m365,IRENE,"Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67."
187586,L231916,u5489,m365,JEROME,What exactly is wrong?
187587,L231915,u5488,m365,IRENE,"It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into."
187588,L231913,u5488,m365,IRENE,I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
187589,L231912,u5489,m365,JEROME,You'll be next.
187590,L231911,u5488,m365,IRENE,"I envy you, Jerome."
187591,L231893,u5489,m365,JEROME,Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
187592,L231892,u5488,m365,IRENE,You're angry--
187593,L231891,u5489,m365,JEROME,Yes...<i>yes</i>...
187594,L231890,u5488,m365,IRENE,You didn't know?
187595,L231841,u5488,m365,IRENE,"You celebrate, Jerome?"
187596,L231840,u5489,m365,JEROME,"Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene."
187597,L231839,u5488,m365,IRENE,Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
187598,L231838,u5489,m365,JEROME,Does it have a name?
187599,L231837,u5488,m365,IRENE,In the South Wing.
187600,L231836,u5489,m365,JEROME,Where?
187601,L231835,u5488,m365,IRENE,They found an eyelash.
187602,L231834,u5489,m365,JEROME,It was a mercy-killing after all.
187603,L231833,u5488,m365,IRENE,Friend?
187604,L231832,u5489,m365,JEROME,Have they found our friend?
187605,L231828,u5488,m365,IRENE,I know about you.
187606,L231827,u5489,m365,JEROME,We were just looking.
187607,L231826,u5488,m365,IRENE,I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
187608,L231729,u5489,m365,JEROME,I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
187609,L231728,u5488,m365,IRENE,Why would we do that?
187610,L231727,u5489,m365,JEROME,Why don't we say we were together?
187611,L231726,u5488,m365,IRENE,No.
187612,L231725,u5489,m365,JEROME,"So we don't know for sure about you, either."

187614,L231723,u5489,m365,JEROME,Were <i>you</i> alone?
187615,L231722,u5488,m365,IRENE,I was at home.
187616,L231721,u5489,m365,JEROME,"Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?"
187617,L231720,u5489,m365,JEROME,No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
187618,L231719,u5488,m365,IRENE,"Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?"
187619,L231718,u5489,m365,JEROME,Last night?  I was at home.
187620,L231717,u5488,m365,IRENE,I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
187621,L231716,u5489,m365,JEROME,No bother.
187622,L232158,u5490,m365,LAMAR,"--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do."

187624,L232156,u5490,m365,LAMAR,"Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here."
187625,L232155,u5489,m365,JEROME,"There's a problem, Lamar."
187626,L232154,u5490,m365,LAMAR,Flight got you nervous?
187627,L232153,u5490,m365,LAMAR,New policy.
187628,L232152,u5489,m365,JEROME,"What's this, Lamar?"
187629,L231957,u5489,m365,JEROME,"Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes."
187630,L231956,u5490,m365,LAMAR,I've got enough here.
187631,L231586,u5489,m365,JEROME,I'll tell you at the end of the week.
187632,L231585,u5490,m365,LAMAR,"If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited."
187633,L231583,u5489,m365,JEROME,Only every time I'm in here.
187634,L231582,u5490,m365,LAMAR,"Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?"
187635,L231602,u5491,m365,MARIA,Antonio--
187636,L231601,u5492,m365,NURSE,The name?  For the certificate.
187637,L231596,u5492,m365,NURSE,"Honey, look around you.  The world doesn't want one like <i>that</i> one."
187638,L231595,u5491,m365,MARIA,Not like <i>this</i> one.
187639,L231594,u5492,m365,NURSE,--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
187640,L231593,u5492,m365,NURSE,"Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--"
187641,L231592,u5491,m365,MARIA,I'm not doing it.
187642,L231591,u5492,m365,NURSE,The doctor will give you something.
187643,L231590,u5491,m365,MARIA,"No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>."
187644,L231589,u5492,m365,NURSE,"I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of."
187645,L231588,u5491,m365,MARIA,I can't do this.
187646,L231587,u5492,m365,NURSE,What are you doing?
187647,L234453,u5496,m366,DOC,Get it over with...
187648,L234452,u5494,m366,BEYNON,"Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman."
187649,L234450,u5496,m366,DOC,I bet.
187650,L234449,u5494,m366,BEYNON,Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
187651,L234448,u5496,m366,DOC,No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
187652,L234447,u5494,m366,BEYNON,The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
187653,L234446,u5496,m366,DOC,So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
187654,L234445,u5494,m366,BEYNON,"A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts."
187655,L234444,u5496,m366,DOC,One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
187656,L234443,u5494,m366,BEYNON,What do you add up to here?
187657,L234442,u5496,m366,DOC,I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
187658,L234441,u5494,m366,BEYNON,"A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank."
187659,L234439,u5496,m366,DOC,No applause!
187660,L234438,u5494,m366,BEYNON,You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
187661,L234437,u5496,m366,DOC,I'm in a hurry.
187662,L234435,u5496,m366,DOC,No way. I always do my own work.
187663,L234434,u5494,m366,BEYNON,"You know, you and I may be two of a kind."
187664,L234433,u5496,m366,DOC,That's your problem.
187665,L234432,u5494,m366,BEYNON,"They may nail me into this now, McCoy."
187666,L234431,u5496,m366,DOC,"You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me."
187667,L234428,u5496,m366,DOC,"What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North."
187668,L234427,u5494,m366,BEYNON,What about your wife?
187669,L234426,u5496,m366,DOC,That's right.
187670,L234425,u5494,m366,BEYNON,And you got him...
187671,L234424,u5496,m366,DOC,Three... Rudy got ambitious.
187672,L234423,u5494,m366,BEYNON,News said two persons killed.
187673,L234422,u5496,m366,DOC,Beynon.
187674,L234421,u5494,m366,BEYNON,"Hello, McCoy."
187675,L234309,u5494,m366,BEYNON,Stay clean.
187676,L234308,u5496,m366,DOC,I'll take care of my end.
187677,L234307,u5494,m366,BEYNON,They will be ready. You guys do your job.
187678,L234306,u5496,m366,DOC,"Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?"
187679,L234297,u5496,m366,DOC,I heard about you. You work with Miller.
187680,L234296,u5494,m366,BEYNON,"Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson..."
187681,L234295,u5494,m366,BEYNON,They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
187682,L234294,u5496,m366,DOC,What about them?
187683,L234293,u5494,m366,BEYNON,"You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up."
187684,L234292,u5496,m366,DOC,I get my own help.
187685,L234291,u5494,m366,BEYNON,You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
187686,L234290,u5494,m366,BEYNON,"This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him..."
187687,L234289,u5496,m366,DOC,I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
187688,L234288,u5494,m366,BEYNON,Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
187689,L234287,u5496,m366,DOC,All it takes is a long arm.
187690,L234285,u5494,m366,BEYNON,"Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch."
187691,L234284,u5496,m366,DOC,You gotta be kidding.
187692,L234841,u5496,m366,DOC,We walk.
187693,L234840,u5495,m366,CAROL,What now?
187694,L234837,u5495,m366,CAROL,I guess we are.

187696,L234835,u5495,m366,CAROL,Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
187697,L234834,u5496,m366,DOC,"Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run."
187698,L234833,u5495,m366,CAROL,Are we going to make it?
187699,L234807,u5496,m366,DOC,Pull over.

187704,L234788,u5495,m366,CAROL,Where do we go from here?
187705,L234787,u5496,m366,DOC,You okay?
187706,L234767,u5496,m366,DOC,Just get your clothes on...

187708,L234765,u5496,m366,DOC,"Come on, come on."
187709,L234755,u5496,m366,DOC,"Get your clothes on, move your butt."
187710,L234754,u5495,m366,CAROL,You're crazy.
187711,L234753,u5496,m366,DOC,"If they are not here, he must have sent them away."
187712,L234752,u5495,m366,CAROL,So what?
187713,L234751,u5496,m366,DOC,Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
187714,L234750,u5495,m366,CAROL,What is it?
187715,L234745,u5496,m366,DOC,Whatever you say.
187716,L234744,u5495,m366,CAROL,Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
187717,L234743,u5496,m366,DOC,I don't know.
187718,L234742,u5495,m366,CAROL,What's wrong?
187719,L234741,u5496,m366,DOC,Yeah.
187720,L234740,u5495,m366,CAROL,I'll be ready.
187721,L234739,u5496,m366,DOC,"Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight."
187722,L234738,u5495,m366,CAROL,"Oh, Jesus... how?"
187723,L234737,u5496,m366,DOC,Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
187724,L234736,u5495,m366,CAROL,Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
187725,L234735,u5496,m366,DOC,"We've got some food coming, should be here any minute."
187726,L234703,u5495,m366,CAROL,That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
187727,L234702,u5496,m366,DOC,"We get to Mexico, we can have a life."
187728,L234701,u5495,m366,CAROL,Can we make it?
187729,L234700,u5496,m366,DOC,You and me.
187730,L234699,u5495,m366,CAROL,Okay.

187732,L234697,u5495,m366,CAROL,Things can't get much worse can they?
187733,L234696,u5496,m366,DOC,You want to try with me?
187734,L234695,u5495,m366,CAROL,Sounds good.
187735,L234694,u5496,m366,DOC,Whatever happens it's over.
187736,L234693,u5495,m366,CAROL,No more about Beynon.
187737,L234692,u5496,m366,DOC,Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
187738,L234691,u5495,m366,CAROL,"I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him."
187739,L234690,u5496,m366,DOC,I guess you're right.
187740,L234689,u5495,m366,CAROL,We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
187741,L234688,u5496,m366,DOC,We got this far.
187742,L234687,u5495,m366,CAROL,"I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off..."
187743,L234686,u5496,m366,DOC,"Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together."
187744,L234685,u5496,m366,DOC,Listen to me. It's hard enough.
187745,L234684,u5495,m366,CAROL,I don't want to hear it.
187746,L234683,u5496,m366,DOC,I want to say something.
187747,L234682,u5495,m366,CAROL,Sure...

187756,L234671,u5496,m366,DOC,Okay?
187757,L234652,u5495,m366,CAROL,Not now.

187759,L234650,u5495,m366,CAROL,Twenty eight hundred.
187760,L234649,u5496,m366,DOC,How much?
187761,L234648,u5495,m366,CAROL,El Paso.
187762,L234647,u5496,m366,DOC,Where are you going?
187763,L234641,u5496,m366,DOC,Let's do it.
187764,L234640,u5495,m366,CAROL,Only one car.
187765,L234617,u5495,m366,CAROL,"You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left."
187766,L234616,u5496,m366,DOC,I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!

187770,L234600,u5496,m366,DOC,From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
187771,L234597,u5495,m366,CAROL,I did I killed a man.

187774,L234588,u5496,m366,DOC,El Paso.
187775,L234587,u5495,m366,CAROL,Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
187776,L234586,u5496,m366,DOC,I think you liked it with him.
187777,L234585,u5495,m366,CAROL,You're full of ifs.

187779,L234583,u5495,m366,CAROL,What?

188060,L235476,u5507,m367,CARTER,What did he say?
188061,L235475,u5504,m367,ALBERT,Yes. I told him.
188062,L235474,u5507,m367,CARTER,Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?

188064,L235472,u5507,m367,CARTER,What did you do?  Albert?
188065,L235471,u5504,m367,ALBERT,"Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest."
188066,L235470,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Do you want to be dead, Albert?"
188067,L235468,u5507,m367,CARTER,And you told Brumby?
188068,L235467,u5504,m367,ALBERT,Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
188069,L235466,u5507,m367,CARTER,Who?
188070,L235465,u5504,m367,ALBERT,No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
188071,L235464,u5507,m367,CARTER,How?
188072,L235463,u5504,m367,ALBERT,A couple of weeks back.
188073,L235462,u5507,m367,CARTER,When did you find out?
188074,L235461,u5504,m367,ALBERT,I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
188075,L235460,u5507,m367,CARTER,How?
188076,L235459,u5504,m367,ALBERT,Yes.
188077,L235458,u5507,m367,CARTER,Did Eric Pake pull her?
188078,L235457,u5504,m367,ALBERT,I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
188079,L235455,u5504,m367,ALBERT,I know.
188080,L235454,u5507,m367,CARTER,"You can't get away from me, Albert."

188083,L235449,u5504,m367,ALBERT,"Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack."
188084,L235101,u5507,m367,CARTER,Was he?
188085,L235100,u5505,m367,BILLY,He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
188086,L235099,u5507,m367,CARTER,"How'd it happen, then?"
188087,L235098,u5505,m367,BILLY,Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
188088,L235097,u5507,m367,CARTER,What about the brakes?
188089,L235096,u5507,m367,CARTER,Was the steering faulty?
188090,L235095,u5505,m367,BILLY,"Well, he drove it into the river."
188091,L235094,u5507,m367,CARTER,Yeah.
188092,L235093,u5505,m367,BILLY,Oh ay?
188093,L235092,u5507,m367,CARTER,This is my brother's car.
188094,L235091,u5505,m367,BILLY,What's it got to do with you?
188095,L235090,u5507,m367,CARTER,What happened to this car?
188096,L235089,u5505,m367,BILLY,What do you want?
188097,L235504,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
188098,L235503,u5507,m367,CARTER,You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
188099,L235402,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,Jack...
188100,L235401,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits."
188101,L235400,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,"Jack, you're wrong."
188102,L235399,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on."
188103,L235398,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,"Christ, what..."
188104,L235397,u5507,m367,CARTER,That's not good enough.
188105,L235396,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,I don't know. That's all I was told.
188106,L235395,u5507,m367,CARTER,Why?
188107,L235394,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,"I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead."
188108,L235393,u5507,m367,CARTER,Why?
188109,L235392,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
188110,L235391,u5507,m367,CARTER,What name?
188111,L235390,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
188112,L235389,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,"Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them  I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead."
188113,L235388,u5507,m367,CARTER,Yes.
188114,L235387,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
188115,L235251,u5507,m367,CARTER,"You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself."
188116,L235250,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,Bloody well tell me who sent you.
188117,L235246,u5507,m367,CARTER,Never mind.
188118,L235245,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,What about?
188119,L235244,u5507,m367,CARTER,I made a mistake.
188120,L235243,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,What?
188121,L235242,u5507,m367,CARTER,I made a mistake.
188122,L235238,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,Well?
188123,L235237,u5507,m367,CARTER,I know.
188124,L235236,u5506,m367,BRUMBY,You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
188125,L235210,u5507,m367,CARTER,"You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit."
188126,L235209,u5521,m367,THORPE,Can I go now?
188127,L235205,u5521,m367,THORPE,On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
188128,L235204,u5507,m367,CARTER,Address?
188129,L235203,u5521,m367,THORPE,He's got a new place at Burnham.
188130,L235202,u5507,m367,CARTER,Where's he living these days?
188131,L235194,u5521,m367,THORPE,Brumby!
188132,L235193,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Who sent you, Thorpey?"
188133,L235192,u5521,m367,THORPE,"No, don't Jack, don't."
188134,L235191,u5507,m367,CARTER,Yes you can.
188135,L235190,u5521,m367,THORPE,I can't Jack. How can I?
188136,L235189,u5507,m367,CARTER,Who paid you to see me off?
188137,L235160,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?"
188138,L235159,u5521,m367,THORPE,I've been asked to make sure you don't.
188139,L235158,u5507,m367,CARTER,That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
188140,L235157,u5521,m367,THORPE,Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
188141,L235155,u5507,m367,CARTER,"You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?"
188142,L235154,u5521,m367,THORPE,"Confidential, like."
188143,L235153,u5507,m367,CARTER,That's nice.
188144,L235152,u5521,m367,THORPE,"I'd like a word with you, Jack."
188145,L235151,u5507,m367,CARTER,Good evening.
188146,L235150,u5521,m367,THORPE,Jack?
188147,L235365,u5518,m367,MARGARET,I don't know nothing.
188148,L235364,u5507,m367,CARTER,You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
188149,L235363,u5518,m367,MARGARET,It is. Honestly.
188150,L235362,u5518,m367,MARGARET,It's the truth.
188151,L235361,u5507,m367,CARTER,"I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?"
188152,L235360,u5518,m367,MARGARET,"He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do."
188153,L235359,u5507,m367,CARTER,What was bugging Frank?
188154,L235358,u5518,m367,MARGARET,"Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?"
188155,L235357,u5507,m367,CARTER,Once a week you like a gentleman?
188156,L235356,u5518,m367,MARGARET,He was gentlemanly. I like that.
188157,L235355,u5507,m367,CARTER,I call that regular.
188158,L235354,u5518,m367,MARGARET,Once a week?
188159,L235353,u5507,m367,CARTER,Why'd you see him so regular?
188160,L235352,u5518,m367,MARGARET,Yes. I can't help the way I am.
188161,L235351,u5507,m367,CARTER,Though nicer than most?
188162,L235350,u5518,m367,MARGARET,Yes.
188163,L235349,u5507,m367,CARTER,"But he was just another feller, wasn't he?"
188164,L235348,u5518,m367,MARGARET,Nicer than most.
188165,L235347,u5507,m367,CARTER,Nothing more? Just another feller?
188166,L235346,u5518,m367,MARGARET,He was all right to me.
188167,L235345,u5507,m367,CARTER,How were things between you and Frank?
188168,L234932,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Tomorrow morning, then?"
188169,L234931,u5518,m367,MARGARET,I can't.
188170,L234930,u5507,m367,CARTER,I want to talk to you later.
188171,L234929,u5518,m367,MARGARET,I must go. I'm in a hurry.
188172,L234928,u5507,m367,CARTER,Really.
188173,L234927,u5518,m367,MARGARET,Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
188174,L234926,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?"
188175,L234925,u5518,m367,MARGARET,"No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know."
188176,L234924,u5507,m367,CARTER,What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
188177,L234923,u5518,m367,MARGARET,She's nothing to do with me.
188178,L234922,u5507,m367,CARTER,Doreen.
188179,L234921,u5518,m367,MARGARET,What about?
188180,L234920,u5507,m367,CARTER,Fine...  I want to talk to you.
188181,L234919,u5518,m367,MARGARET,Everyhing go off all right?
188182,L235442,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed."
188183,L235441,u5514,m367,GLENDA,No.
188184,L235440,u5507,m367,CARTER,And you didn't know her last name?
188185,L235439,u5514,m367,GLENDA,The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
188186,L235438,u5507,m367,CARTER,Now tell me the truth.
188187,L235436,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Your brother? What you talking about?
188188,L235435,u5507,m367,CARTER,Did my brother Frank find out?
188189,L235434,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Expect so.
188190,L235433,u5507,m367,CARTER,Then he must have pulled her.
188191,L235432,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Yeah.
188192,L235431,u5507,m367,CARTER,Who set it up?  Eric?
188193,L235430,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Yeah.
188194,L235429,u5507,m367,CARTER,Is it one of Kinnear's films?
188195,L235428,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Shouldn't think so.
188196,L235427,u5507,m367,CARTER,Was it Albert?
188197,L235426,u5514,m367,GLENDA,I don't know.
188198,L235425,u5507,m367,CARTER,The young girl. Who pulled her?
188199,L235424,u5514,m367,GLENDA,What girl?
188200,L235423,u5507,m367,CARTER,Tell me about the girl.
188201,L235422,u5514,m367,GLENDA,You've been watching the film.
188202,L235421,u5507,m367,CARTER,I want to give you an Oscar.
188203,L235419,u5507,m367,CARTER,Sure I'm sure.
188204,L235418,u5514,m367,GLENDA,You sure about that?
188205,L235417,u5507,m367,CARTER,Not entirely. No.
188206,L235416,u5514,m367,GLENDA,That's why you waited for me.
188207,L235414,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Especially when I play the lead.
188208,L235413,u5507,m367,CARTER,Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
188209,L235412,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Now you're asking.
188210,L235411,u5507,m367,CARTER,What kind of entertaining?
188211,L235410,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Entertaining.
188212,L235409,u5507,m367,CARTER,What does he want that bloody great country place for?
188213,L235408,u5514,m367,GLENDA,He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
188214,L235407,u5507,m367,CARTER,Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
188215,L235406,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
188216,L235405,u5507,m367,CARTER,Is he coming here?
188217,L235404,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Brumby.
188218,L235403,u5507,m367,CARTER,Who's setting you up in this place?
188219,L235386,u5514,m367,GLENDA,We're there now.
188220,L235385,u5507,m367,CARTER,And what was that?
188221,L235384,u5514,m367,GLENDA,"Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come."
188222,L235383,u5507,m367,CARTER,He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
188223,L235382,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Nasty.
188224,L235381,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!"
188225,L235380,u5514,m367,GLENDA,You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
188226,L235379,u5507,m367,CARTER,How'd you know where I'd be?
188227,L235378,u5507,m367,CARTER,Of course. Where else?
188228,L235377,u5514,m367,GLENDA,"To the demon king's castle, of course."
188229,L235376,u5507,m367,CARTER,"So where are we going, Princess?"
188230,L235375,u5514,m367,GLENDA,"A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?"
188231,L235374,u5507,m367,CARTER,No. I didn't know that.
188232,L235373,u5514,m367,GLENDA,"You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?"
188233,L235075,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Could you please put my glass on the table?
188234,L235074,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Yeah, I'll do you a favour."
188235,L235073,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Could you do me a favour?
188236,L235072,u5507,m367,CARTER,Was he?
188237,L235071,u5514,m367,GLENDA,He was here for four days.
188238,L235070,u5507,m367,CARTER,While he was here. You went about together?
188239,L235069,u5514,m367,GLENDA,"Yes, while he was here."
188240,L235068,u5507,m367,CARTER,Really?
188241,L235067,u5514,m367,GLENDA,We went about together.
188242,L235058,u5507,m367,CARTER,No.
188243,L235057,u5514,m367,GLENDA,He came to see Mr Kinnear.
188244,L235056,u5507,m367,CARTER,Really?
188245,L235055,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Oh yes. When he came up on business.
188246,L235054,u5507,m367,CARTER,Go on.
188247,L235053,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Yes. I met him last year.
188248,L235048,u5507,m367,CARTER,"No, do you really?"
188249,L235047,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Yes.
188250,L235046,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Oh, do you?"
188251,L235045,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Sid Fletcher.
188252,L235044,u5507,m367,CARTER,Who?
188253,L235043,u5514,m367,GLENDA,I know him too.
188254,L235035,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Yes, I do."
188255,L235034,u5514,m367,GLENDA,Do you?
188256,L235033,u5507,m367,CARTER,I work for him.
188257,L235032,u5514,m367,GLENDA,You know Sid Fletcher?
188258,L235031,u5507,m367,CARTER,What?
188259,L235030,u5514,m367,GLENDA,You know Sid Fletcher?
188260,L234954,u5510,m367,EDDIE,Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
188261,L234953,u5507,m367,CARTER,Thanks for coming.
188262,L234952,u5510,m367,EDDIE,No. It's all right.
188263,L234951,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned."
188264,L234950,u5510,m367,EDDIE,No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
188265,L234949,u5507,m367,CARTER,Have another?
188266,L234948,u5510,m367,EDDIE,Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
188267,L234947,u5507,m367,CARTER,Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
188268,L234915,u5507,m367,CARTER,Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
188269,L234914,u5510,m367,EDDIE,It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
188270,L234906,u5510,m367,EDDIE,No. Frank was a good bloke.
188271,L234905,u5507,m367,CARTER,Nice of you to come.
188272,L234904,u5510,m367,EDDIE,"We weren't sure where it was taking place, like."
188273,L235124,u5509,m367,DOREEN,Thanks.
188274,L235123,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done."
188275,L235122,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?"
188276,L235121,u5509,m367,DOREEN,Wilton Estate.
188277,L235120,u5507,m367,CARTER,Where's that?
188278,L235119,u5509,m367,DOREEN,At me friend's house.
188279,L235118,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Where you going to live, then?"
188280,L235117,u5509,m367,DOREEN,No.
188281,L235116,u5507,m367,CARTER,You coming to South America?
188282,L235115,u5509,m367,DOREEN,Yeah.
188283,L235114,u5507,m367,CARTER,You all right now?
188284,L234900,u5509,m367,DOREEN,Yes.
188285,L234899,u5507,m367,CARTER,That must be interesting.
188286,L234898,u5509,m367,DOREEN,Working at Woolworths.
188287,L234897,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Oh, what you doing now?"
188288,L234896,u5509,m367,DOREEN,I left last year.
188289,L234895,u5507,m367,CARTER,How's school?
188290,L234894,u5509,m367,DOREEN,They said he was drunk.
188291,L234893,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?"
188292,L234892,u5509,m367,DOREEN,Yeah.
188293,L234891,u5507,m367,CARTER,Sorry about your father.
188294,L235341,u5507,m367,CARTER,I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
188295,L235340,u5516,m367,KEITH,"Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?"
188296,L235339,u5516,m367,KEITH,Oh yes? How?
188297,L235338,u5507,m367,CARTER,All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
188298,L235337,u5516,m367,KEITH,Get knotted.
188299,L235336,u5507,m367,CARTER,"No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?"
188300,L235335,u5516,m367,KEITH,No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
188301,L235334,u5507,m367,CARTER,Did they give you a rough time?
188302,L235333,u5516,m367,KEITH,How'd you find me?
188303,L235332,u5507,m367,CARTER,"What happened to you, then?"
188304,L235201,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?"
188305,L235200,u5516,m367,KEITH,Yeah.
188306,L235199,u5507,m367,CARTER,Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
188307,L235198,u5507,m367,CARTER,Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
188308,L235197,u5516,m367,KEITH,Who's Brumby?
188309,L235196,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set."
188310,L235149,u5516,m367,KEITH,Four of them.
188311,L235148,u5507,m367,CARTER,How many?
188312,L235147,u5516,m367,KEITH,Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
188313,L235113,u5507,m367,CARTER,Las Vegas.
188314,L235112,u5516,m367,KEITH,Where you off to?
188315,L235111,u5507,m367,CARTER,See you later.
188316,L235110,u5507,m367,CARTER,Good lad.
188317,L235109,u5516,m367,KEITH,Nowt.
188318,L235108,u5507,m367,CARTER,That's nice. What'd you tell him?
188319,L235107,u5516,m367,KEITH,Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
188320,L235106,u5516,m367,KEITH,That's what he was saying about you.
188321,L235105,u5507,m367,CARTER,Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
188322,L235104,u5516,m367,KEITH,Heard of a man called Thorpe?
188323,L235103,u5507,m367,CARTER,Large Scotch.
188324,L235102,u5516,m367,KEITH,"What you having, Jack?"
188325,L234964,u5507,m367,CARTER,Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
188326,L234963,u5516,m367,KEITH,How'd you know Albert?
188327,L234962,u5516,m367,KEITH,Today? At the races. He always goes.
188328,L234961,u5507,m367,CARTER,Where would I find him?
188329,L234960,u5516,m367,KEITH,Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
188330,L234959,u5507,m367,CARTER,I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
188331,L234958,u5516,m367,KEITH,Right.
188332,L234957,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?"
188333,L234956,u5516,m367,KEITH,Yes.
188334,L234955,u5507,m367,CARTER,"You work here, Keith?"
188335,L234944,u5507,m367,CARTER,Nobody seems to know.
188336,L234943,u5516,m367,KEITH,Don't know.
188337,L234942,u5507,m367,CARTER,Since when did he drink whisky?
188338,L234941,u5516,m367,KEITH,It just would. He was always the same.
188339,L234940,u5507,m367,CARTER,Why would it?
188340,L234939,u5516,m367,KEITH,"Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed."
188341,L234938,u5507,m367,CARTER,That's what I was wondering.
188342,L234937,u5516,m367,KEITH,"I mean, what for?"
188343,L234913,u5516,m367,KEITH,At the Half Moon.
188344,L234912,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Did you work with him, Keith?"
188345,L234911,u5516,m367,KEITH,"I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time."
188346,L234910,u5507,m367,CARTER,What?
188347,L234909,u5516,m367,KEITH,I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
188348,L235326,u5507,m367,CARTER,How could I stay away?
188349,L235325,u5511,m367,EDNA,You coming back?
188350,L235324,u5507,m367,CARTER,"I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'."
188351,L235323,u5511,m367,EDNA,What you going to do?
188352,L235318,u5507,m367,CARTER,"I don't want to get rough, do I?"
188353,L235317,u5511,m367,EDNA,And that'll make me feel better?
188354,L235316,u5507,m367,CARTER,They're friends of mine.
188355,L235315,u5511,m367,EDNA,Not much.
188356,L235314,u5507,m367,CARTER,No chance of that.

188364,L235284,u5511,m367,EDNA,Uh-huh.
188365,L235283,u5507,m367,CARTER,"You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?"
188366,L235282,u5511,m367,EDNA,Do you want breakfast?
188367,L235281,u5507,m367,CARTER,No.
188368,L235280,u5511,m367,EDNA,Are you awake?
188369,L235279,u5507,m367,CARTER,Think about it.
188370,L235278,u5511,m367,EDNA,What's that supposed to mean?

188372,L235276,u5511,m367,EDNA,How'd you know I wouldn't?
188373,L235275,u5507,m367,CARTER,You wouldn't.
188374,L235274,u5511,m367,EDNA,What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
188375,L235273,u5507,m367,CARTER,So shut up.
188376,L235272,u5507,m367,CARTER,What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
188377,L235271,u5511,m367,EDNA,You're a bastard.
188378,L235270,u5507,m367,CARTER,Pension him off.
188379,L235269,u5511,m367,EDNA,What you going to do?
188380,L235268,u5507,m367,CARTER,What about Keith?
188381,L235267,u5511,m367,EDNA,What about Keith?
188382,L235266,u5507,m367,CARTER,That little shit!
188383,L235265,u5511,m367,EDNA,Thorpey nearly died laughing.
188384,L235264,u5511,m367,EDNA,And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
188385,L235263,u5507,m367,CARTER,You're lucky. They kill as well.
188386,L235262,u5511,m367,EDNA,They bloody hurt me.
188387,L235261,u5507,m367,CARTER,Don't ask me.
188388,L235260,u5511,m367,EDNA,What'll they do to him?
188389,L235255,u5511,m367,EDNA,No.
188390,L235254,u5507,m367,CARTER,They came back?
188391,L235253,u5511,m367,EDNA,You sod.
188392,L235212,u5507,m367,CARTER,Ta-ra.

188395,L235207,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ..."
188396,L235206,u5511,m367,EDNA,"Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know."
188397,L235185,u5507,m367,CARTER,"No, you won't."
188398,L235184,u5511,m367,EDNA,I'll call the police.
188399,L235183,u5507,m367,CARTER,Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
188400,L235182,u5511,m367,EDNA,And what you going to do?
188401,L235175,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right."
188402,L235174,u5511,m367,EDNA,Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
188403,L235171,u5511,m367,EDNA,"Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy.  And who's he?"
188404,L235170,u5507,m367,CARTER,"No. Really, I am."
188405,L235169,u5511,m367,EDNA,You don't look it.
188406,L235168,u5507,m367,CARTER,I'm sorry.
188407,L235167,u5511,m367,EDNA,What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
188408,L235131,u5511,m367,EDNA,It'll cost you.
188409,L235130,u5507,m367,CARTER,Funny.  Can I phone London?
188410,L235129,u5511,m367,EDNA,Is he staying the night?
188411,L235128,u5507,m367,CARTER,"My brother, Frank."
188412,L235127,u5511,m367,EDNA,What is it?
188413,L234884,u5507,m367,CARTER,I'll bet this one's seen some action.
188414,L234883,u5511,m367,EDNA,Ta.

188419,L234878,u5507,m367,CARTER,Definitely.
188420,L234877,u5511,m367,EDNA,Are you a traveller?
188421,L234876,u5511,m367,EDNA,It never is.
188422,L234875,u5507,m367,CARTER,"It's not like that, luv."
188423,L234874,u5511,m367,EDNA,"Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?"
188424,L234873,u5507,m367,CARTER,I'm staying with a friend.
188425,L234872,u5511,m367,EDNA,I see.
188426,L234871,u5507,m367,CARTER,I won't be using the room tonight.
188427,L235534,u5512,m367,ERIC,Still got your sense of humour.
188428,L235533,u5507,m367,CARTER,Eh? Have a drink.
188429,L235529,u5512,m367,ERIC,Sod off.
188430,L235528,u5507,m367,CARTER,"You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric."
188431,L235490,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Not till I'm dead, Eric."
188432,L235489,u5512,m367,ERIC,"You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you."
188433,L235087,u5512,m367,ERIC,He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
188434,L235086,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?"
188435,L235085,u5512,m367,ERIC,"Cyril didn't like it, either."
188436,L235084,u5507,m367,CARTER,You should have told me who you were working for.
188437,L235083,u5512,m367,ERIC,Jack! I didn't like that.
188438,L235000,u5512,m367,ERIC,Can't say I do.
188439,L234999,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?"
188440,L234998,u5512,m367,ERIC,Still got a sense of humour?
188441,L234997,u5507,m367,CARTER,They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
188442,L234996,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like."
188443,L234995,u5512,m367,ERIC,Making a living.
188444,L234994,u5507,m367,CARTER,"So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good."
188445,L234993,u5507,m367,CARTER,"And you should know, if I remember rightly."
188446,L234992,u5512,m367,ERIC,That's not always a healthy way to be...
188447,L234991,u5507,m367,CARTER,"I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy."
188448,L234990,u5512,m367,ERIC,What's it to you anyway?
188449,L234987,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?"
188450,L234986,u5512,m367,ERIC,"Oh, you've been watching television."
188451,L234985,u5507,m367,CARTER,What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
188452,L234984,u5512,m367,ERIC,"Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable."
188453,L234983,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?"
188454,L234982,u5512,m367,ERIC,"Well, well. Small world, isn't it?"
188455,L234981,u5507,m367,CARTER,"That's all right, Eric."
188456,L234980,u5512,m367,ERIC,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
188457,L234979,u5507,m367,CARTER,A bereavement. A death in the family.
188458,L234978,u5512,m367,ERIC,Meaning what?
188459,L234977,u5507,m367,CARTER,It would be. If they were still living.
188460,L234976,u5512,m367,ERIC,"Oh, that's nice."
188461,L234975,u5507,m367,CARTER,No. I'm visiting relatives.
188462,L234974,u5512,m367,ERIC,Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
188463,L234973,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Funny, that."
188464,L234972,u5512,m367,ERIC,"No, I didn't know that."
188465,L234971,u5507,m367,CARTER,Didn't you know this is my home town?
188466,L234970,u5512,m367,ERIC,What you doing around here then?
188467,L234969,u5507,m367,CARTER,Eric. Eric Paice.
188468,L234968,u5512,m367,ERIC,Jack Carter.
188469,L234967,u5507,m367,CARTER,Is he?
188470,L235082,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?"
188471,L235081,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by."
188472,L235080,u5507,m367,CARTER,I have to. Things to see to.
188473,L235079,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"Not going, Jack?"
188474,L235018,u5507,m367,CARTER,Yes.
188475,L235017,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,Nasty way to go.
188476,L235016,u5507,m367,CARTER,Yeah.
188477,L235015,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better."
188478,L235014,u5507,m367,CARTER,No? Funny that. Neither did I.
188479,L235013,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!"
188480,L235012,u5507,m367,CARTER,Yep.
188481,L235011,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,Eric told me of your bereavement.
188482,L235010,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"Piss off, Ray."
188483,L235009,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Scotch, please."
188484,L235008,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?"
188485,L235007,u5507,m367,CARTER,"Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear."
188486,L235487,u5519,m367,PETER,Shut up.
188487,L235486,u5508,m367,CON,Gerald wants to see him first.
188488,L235303,u5519,m367,PETER,The gun he means.
188489,L235302,u5508,m367,CON,"Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it."
188490,L235299,u5519,m367,PETER,But they have to be diplomatic.
188491,L235298,u5508,m367,CON,"We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid."
188492,L235297,u5508,m367,CON,He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
188493,L235296,u5519,m367,PETER,We've got to take you back to London.
188494,L235295,u5508,m367,CON,"Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself."
188495,L234854,u5513,m367,GERALD,What? And get the clap?
188496,L234853,u5520,m367,SID,"Knock it off, Gerald."
188497,L234852,u5513,m367,GERALD,Not suede boots!
188498,L234848,u5513,m367,GERALD,Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
188499,L234847,u5520,m367,SID,Ask me?
188500,L234846,u5513,m367,GERALD,What for? Protective purposes?
188501,L234845,u5520,m367,SID,They do that up North.
188502,L234844,u5513,m367,GERALD,Bollock naked with his socks still on?
188503,L235078,u5515,m367,HARRY,Shut up.
188504,L235077,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on."
188505,L235066,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?"
188506,L235065,u5515,m367,HARRY,"I'll see you, then."
188507,L235064,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,No.
188508,L235063,u5515,m367,HARRY,You're not seeing me?
188509,L235062,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,That's right.
188510,L235061,u5515,m367,HARRY,Four hundred?
188511,L235060,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred."
188512,L235059,u5515,m367,HARRY,What's that?
188513,L235052,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,Ha.
188514,L235051,u5515,m367,HARRY,All right. Two hundred.
188515,L235042,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"Three hundred altogether, Harry."
188516,L235041,u5515,m367,HARRY,Three hundred altogether?
188517,L235040,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm."
188518,L235039,u5515,m367,HARRY,What's that?
188519,L235038,u5515,m367,HARRY,"Your hundred, and another hundred."
188520,L235037,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"That's right, Harry."
188521,L235036,u5515,m367,HARRY,What's that? A hundred?
188522,L235023,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?"
188523,L235022,u5515,m367,HARRY,"You're bluffing, you bastard!"
188524,L235021,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
188525,L235020,u5517,m367,KINNEAR,"Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?"
188526,L235019,u5515,m367,HARRY,Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
188527,L244438,u5522,m368,AARONOW,"If anyone's going, I could use some coffee."
188528,L244437,u5526,m368,MOSS,Uh-huh.
188529,L244436,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Fine.
188530,L244435,u5526,m368,MOSS,How ya doing?
188531,L244434,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Can we get some coffee...?
188532,L244204,u5526,m368,MOSS,Because you listened.
188533,L244203,u5522,m368,AARONOW,And why is that?
188534,L244202,u5526,m368,MOSS,Yes.
188535,L244201,u5522,m368,AARONOW,I do?
188536,L244200,u5526,m368,MOSS,"I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences."
188537,L244199,u5522,m368,AARONOW,"What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five..."
188538,L244198,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?"
188539,L244197,u5522,m368,AARONOW,You need money?  Is that the...
188540,L244196,u5526,m368,MOSS,Is that what I just said?
188541,L244195,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Do you need five grand?
188542,L244194,u5526,m368,MOSS,Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
188543,L244193,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Why?
188544,L244192,u5526,m368,MOSS,So I'm making it concrete.
188545,L244191,u5522,m368,AARONOW,In the abstract...
188546,L244190,u5526,m368,MOSS,You went for it.
188547,L244189,u5522,m368,AARONOW,"Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal..."
188548,L244188,u5526,m368,MOSS,That's none of your fucking business...
188549,L244187,u5522,m368,AARONOW,"Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?"
188550,L244186,u5526,m368,MOSS,That's right.
188551,L244185,u5522,m368,AARONOW,"Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?"
188552,L244184,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Then tough luck, George, because you are."
188553,L244183,u5522,m368,AARONOW,I didn't ask to be.
188554,L244182,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact."
188555,L244181,u5522,m368,AARONOW,That's ridiculous.
188556,L244180,u5526,m368,MOSS,Absolutely.
188557,L244179,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Me?
188558,L244178,u5526,m368,MOSS,"...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices."
188559,L244177,u5522,m368,AARONOW,...I thought that we were only talking...
188560,L244176,u5526,m368,MOSS,...and rob the place...
188561,L244175,u5522,m368,AARONOW,...you don't have to come in...
188562,L244174,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here..."
188563,L244173,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Yes.  I'm sure.
188564,L244172,u5526,m368,MOSS,Are you sure?
188565,L244171,u5522,m368,AARONOW,No.
188566,L244170,u5526,m368,MOSS,"You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?"
188567,L244169,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Why would I do it?
188568,L244168,u5526,m368,MOSS,They're going to come to everyone.
188569,L244167,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Why would they come to me?
188570,L244166,u5526,m368,MOSS,"They come to you, you going to turn me in?"
188571,L244165,u5522,m368,AARONOW,What if you don't get caught?
188572,L244164,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?"
188573,L244163,u5522,m368,AARONOW,What does that mean?
188574,L244162,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Oh, yes, George."
188575,L244160,u5526,m368,MOSS,Yes.
188576,L244159,u5522,m368,AARONOW,You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
188577,L244158,u5526,m368,MOSS,Yes.
188578,L244157,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Dave.
188579,L244156,u5526,m368,MOSS,"What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case."
188580,L244155,u5522,m368,AARONOW,They'll know when you go over to Graff...
188581,L244154,u5526,m368,MOSS,"It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  ""The fucking leads"" et cetera, blah blah blah ""...the fucking tight ass company..."""
188582,L244153,u5522,m368,AARONOW,I...

188590,L244144,u5526,m368,MOSS,"That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest."
188591,L244143,u5522,m368,AARONOW,You have to steal the leads tonight?
188592,L244142,u5526,m368,MOSS,What?  What?  The leads.
188593,L244141,u5522,m368,AARONOW,What?
188594,L244140,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight."
188595,L244138,u5526,m368,MOSS,He would take you on.  Yes.
188596,L244137,u5522,m368,AARONOW,He'd give me a job.
188597,L244136,u5526,m368,MOSS,Is that what I said?
188598,L244135,u5522,m368,AARONOW,A job with Graff.
188599,L244134,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads."
188600,L244133,u5522,m368,AARONOW,"You're saying ""me."""
188601,L244132,u5526,m368,MOSS,"However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half."
188602,L244131,u5522,m368,AARONOW,For five thousand?
188603,L244130,u5526,m368,MOSS,A buck a shot.
188604,L244129,u5522,m368,AARONOW,What will he pay?
188605,L244128,u5526,m368,MOSS,Yes.
188606,L244126,u5526,m368,MOSS,What did he say?  He'd buy them.
188607,L244125,u5522,m368,AARONOW,What did he say?
188608,L244124,u5526,m368,MOSS,Is that what I said?
188609,L244123,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Did you talk to Graff?
188610,L244122,u5526,m368,MOSS,Did I say that?
188611,L244120,u5526,m368,MOSS,Have I said that?
188612,L244119,u5522,m368,AARONOW,You're going to steal the leads?
188613,L244118,u5526,m368,MOSS,That's right.
188614,L244117,u5522,m368,AARONOW,You're actually talking about this?
188615,L244116,u5526,m368,MOSS,That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
188616,L244115,u5522,m368,AARONOW,"Because, because, you know, it's a crime."
188617,L244113,u5522,m368,AARONOW,We are?
188618,L244112,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Yes.  I said, ""Not actually."" The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking..."
188619,L244111,u5526,m368,MOSS,What did you say?
188620,L244110,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Did you?
188621,L244109,u5526,m368,MOSS,No.  Not actually.
188622,L244108,u5522,m368,AARONOW,You didn't?
188623,L244107,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Not actually, no."
188624,L244106,u5522,m368,AARONOW,"So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff."
188625,L244105,u5526,m368,MOSS,Hey.
188626,L244104,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Well.  Well...

188629,L244101,u5526,m368,MOSS,No.
188630,L244100,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Talking about it as a...
188631,L244099,u5526,m368,MOSS,No.
188632,L244098,u5522,m368,AARONOW,We're not actually talking about it.

188635,L244095,u5526,m368,MOSS,We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
188636,L244094,u5522,m368,AARONOW,"We're just ""talking"" about it."
188637,L244093,u5526,m368,MOSS,"No, we're just..."
188638,L244092,u5522,m368,AARONOW,"Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just..."
188639,L244091,u5526,m368,MOSS,No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
188640,L244090,u5522,m368,AARONOW,You haven't talked to him.
188641,L244089,u5526,m368,MOSS,Graff?  Because I worked for him.
188642,L244088,u5522,m368,AARONOW,How do you know he'd buy them?
188643,L244087,u5526,m368,MOSS,Yes.
188644,L244086,u5522,m368,AARONOW,And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
188645,L244085,u5526,m368,MOSS,The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
188646,L244084,u5522,m368,AARONOW,How many leads have we got?
188647,L244083,u5526,m368,MOSS,"What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know."
188648,L244082,u5522,m368,AARONOW,What could somebody get for them?
188649,L244081,u5526,m368,MOSS,"That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff."
188650,L244080,u5522,m368,AARONOW,Huh.
188651,L244079,u5526,m368,MOSS,Someone should rob the office.
188652,L244078,u5522,m368,AARONOW,What?
188653,L244077,u5526,m368,MOSS,How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.

188663,L244067,u5526,m368,MOSS,Someone should stand up and strike back.
188664,L244066,u5522,m368,AARONOW,What?
188665,L244065,u5526,m368,MOSS,I want to tell you what somebody should do.
188666,L244064,u5522,m368,AARONOW,What?

Moss gets me, ""Do this, we'll get well..."" Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right."
188971,L244766,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Mmm.
188972,L244765,u5524,m368,LEVENE,He told me my share was twenty-five.
188973,L244764,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Uh-huh?
188974,L244763,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually."
188975,L244762,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Was it?
188976,L244761,u5524,m368,LEVENE,It was his idea.
188977,L244760,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,"That was easy, wasn't it?"
188978,L244759,u5524,m368,LEVENE,Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
188979,L244758,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Who kept the other half?
188980,L244757,u5524,m368,LEVENE,Five thousand.  I kept half.
188981,L244756,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
188982,L244755,u5524,m368,LEVENE,I sold them to Jerry Graff.
188983,L244753,u5524,m368,LEVENE,I...
188984,L244752,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,"If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail."
188985,L244751,u5524,m368,LEVENE,I don't know what you are saying.
188986,L244750,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,"What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk."
188987,L244749,u5524,m368,LEVENE,Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
188988,L244748,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,You robbed the office.
188989,L244747,u5524,m368,LEVENE,You're so full of shit.
188990,L244746,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,"Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?"
188991,L244745,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?"
188992,L244744,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,No.  It hadn't.
188993,L244743,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"Well, hadn't it?"
188994,L244742,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
188995,L244741,u5524,m368,LEVENE,What are you talking about?
188996,L244740,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,"You said, ""You don't make something up unless it's sure to help.""  How did you know that I made it up?"
188997,L244739,u5524,m368,LEVENE,What are you talking about?
188998,L244738,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,How do you know I made it up?
188999,L244737,u5524,m368,LEVENE,What?
189000,L244736,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,How do you know I made it up?
189001,L244733,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed."
189002,L244732,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Excuse me...
189003,L244731,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"You listen to me, someday you might say, ""Hey..."" No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your ""partner"" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone..."
189004,L244730,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Why I don't...
189005,L244729,u5524,m368,LEVENE,What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
189006,L244728,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,What are you trying to tell me?
189007,L244727,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"Yes, I am."
189008,L244726,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,You are?
189009,L244725,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something."
189010,L244724,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Mmm.
189011,L244723,u5524,m368,LEVENE,You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
189012,L244722,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Yes.  I hear you.
189013,L244721,u5524,m368,LEVENE,You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
189014,L244720,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Mmm.
189015,L244496,u5524,m368,LEVENE,On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
189016,L244495,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,It's not impossible.
189017,L244494,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?"
189018,L244493,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,"I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly."
189019,L244492,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your ""end of month board..."" You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust..."
189020,L244491,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,"That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle."
189021,L244490,u5524,m368,LEVENE,What does that fucking mean?
189022,L244489,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
189023,L244488,u5524,m368,LEVENE,All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
189024,L244487,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,"Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense..."
189025,L244486,u5524,m368,LEVENE,It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
189026,L244485,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
189027,L244484,u5524,m368,LEVENE,Did you tell 'em my sale?
189028,L244483,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,"I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's..."
189029,L244482,u5524,m368,LEVENE,Get 'em to me!
189030,L244481,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,The leads are coming.
189031,L244480,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!"
189032,L244370,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Somebody broke in.
189033,L244369,u5524,m368,LEVENE,What happened?
189034,L243951,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"The deal still stands, our other thing."
189035,L243950,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,That's alright.
189036,L243949,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you."
189037,L243948,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Is that what you're saying?
189038,L243947,u5524,m368,LEVENE,Yeah.  Yeah.
189039,L243946,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,You want something off the B list?
189040,L243945,u5524,m368,LEVENE,You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
189041,L243944,u5524,m368,LEVENE,Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
189042,L243943,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Because I say so.
189043,L243942,u5524,m368,LEVENE,Why?
189044,L243941,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,I can't split them.
189045,L243940,u5524,m368,LEVENE,Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
189046,L243939,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,I have to go...
189047,L243938,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. ""Mur, this new kid burns my ass."" ""Shelly, he's out."" You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once..."
189048,L243937,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,"I can't do it, Shelly..."
189049,L243936,u5524,m368,LEVENE,I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
189050,L243935,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,No.
189051,L243934,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?"
189052,L243933,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Can't do it.
189053,L243932,u5524,m368,LEVENE,"You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow."
189054,L243931,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,I wish I could.
189055,L243929,u5528,m368,WILLIAMSON,Now.  Yes...When?

Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help."

189353,L244545,u5527,m368,ROMA,"I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock."
189354,L244544,u5525,m368,LINGK,I've got to talk to you...
189355,L244513,u5527,m368,ROMA,"Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton..."
189356,L244512,u5525,m368,LINGK,I've got to talk to you.
189357,L244219,u5527,m368,ROMA,"James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not."
189358,L244218,u5525,m368,LINGK,Lingk.  James Lingk.
189359,L244217,u5527,m368,ROMA,"Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?"
189360,L244216,u5525,m368,LINGK,Gimlet.
189361,L244215,u5527,m368,ROMA,"Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?"
189362,L244213,u5527,m368,ROMA,"I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me caf au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act?"
189363,L244212,u5525,m368,LINGK,Mmmm...
189364,L244211,u5527,m368,ROMA,Yes.
189365,L244210,u5525,m368,LINGK,What do I...?
189366,L244209,u5527,m368,ROMA,"Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?"
189367,L244208,u5525,m368,LINGK,I don't know.
189368,L244207,u5527,m368,ROMA,Yes.
189369,L244206,u5525,m368,LINGK,Did I...?
189370,L244205,u5527,m368,ROMA,"...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?"
189371,L244464,u5526,m368,MOSS,And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.

189375,L244460,u5526,m368,MOSS,I'm going home.
189376,L244459,u5527,m368,ROMA,"What is this, your farewell speech?"
189377,L244458,u5526,m368,MOSS,"Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you."

Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week.

189384,L244449,u5526,m368,MOSS,Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
189385,L244446,u5526,m368,MOSS,"You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?"
189386,L244445,u5527,m368,ROMA,"It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth."
189387,L244424,u5527,m368,ROMA,They took 'em...
189388,L244423,u5526,m368,MOSS,Why not?

189457,L245986,u5529,m369,ANTHONY,I'm not hungry.
189458,L245985,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out."
189459,L245984,u5529,m369,ANTHONY,I was taller than you when I was fourteen.

189484,L245698,u5530,m369,CICCI,That's right.
189485,L245697,u5555,m369,SENATOR,"Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;"

189487,L245691,u5559,m369,VITO,Who is the greatest man you can think of?
189488,L245176,u5559,m369,VITO,"This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone."
189489,L245175,u5531,m369,CLEMENZA,What?  You read it in the papers?
189490,L245174,u5559,m369,VITO,Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
189491,L245167,u5559,m369,VITO,"If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me."
189492,L245166,u5531,m369,CLEMENZA,They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
189493,L245134,u5531,m369,CLEMENZA,"Oh yes, the very best."
189494,L245133,u5559,m369,VITO,Your friend lives in a fine building.
189495,L245131,u5531,m369,CLEMENZA,No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
189496,L245130,u5559,m369,VITO,We have no money for a rug.
189497,L245129,u5531,m369,CLEMENZA,I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
189498,L245173,u5531,m369,CLEMENZA,"Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!"
189499,L245172,u5558,m369,TESSIO,He's going to kill Fanucci.
189500,L245171,u5531,m369,CLEMENZA,Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
189501,L245165,u5558,m369,TESSIO,What can we do?
189502,L245164,u5531,m369,CLEMENZA,"You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?"
189503,L245163,u5558,m369,TESSIO,What if we don't pay?
189504,L245162,u5531,m369,CLEMENZA,That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
189505,L245161,u5558,m369,TESSIO,Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
189506,L245148,u5531,m369,CLEMENZA,She couldn't decide.
189507,L245147,u5558,m369,TESSIO,What took so long?
189508,L245025,u5532,m369,CONNIE,"Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?"
189509,L245024,u5543,m369,MAMA,Connie.
189510,L245023,u5532,m369,CONNIE,"It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true."
189511,L244902,u5543,m369,MAMA,"You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else."
189512,L244901,u5532,m369,CONNIE,This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
189513,L244900,u5543,m369,MAMA,Bought at the airport.
189514,L244899,u5532,m369,CONNIE,I got surprises for everybody!
189515,L244898,u5543,m369,MAMA,"Well, thank you, they asked for you all week."
189516,L244897,u5532,m369,CONNIE,How are the kids?
189517,L244896,u5543,m369,MAMA,"Yes, thank you."
189518,L244895,u5532,m369,CONNIE,"I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?"
189519,L244894,u5543,m369,MAMA,Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
189520,L245896,u5532,m369,CONNIE,"I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you."
189521,L245895,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,The children can stay.
189522,L245894,u5532,m369,CONNIE,"I want to talk to you, Michael."
189523,L245893,u5532,m369,CONNIE,"Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?"
189524,L245892,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Tom is right.
189525,L245891,u5532,m369,CONNIE,"Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you."
189526,L245890,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,No.
189527,L245889,u5532,m369,CONNIE,Is Kay coming?
189528,L244960,u5532,m369,CONNIE,It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
189529,L244959,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me."
189530,L244958,u5532,m369,CONNIE,Because I need MONEY!
189531,L244957,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Then why do you come to me?
189532,L244956,u5532,m369,CONNIE,You're not my father!
189533,L244955,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore."
189534,L244954,u5532,m369,CONNIE,Michael...
189535,L244953,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about."
189536,L244951,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
189537,L244950,u5532,m369,CONNIE,We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
189538,L244949,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I saw him with you.
189539,L244948,u5532,m369,CONNIE,"How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas."
189540,L245223,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman..."
189541,L245222,u5533,m369,DEANNA,I don't want to stay here...
189542,L245220,u5533,m369,DEANNA,I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
189543,L245219,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Deanna, will you get back into the house!"
189544,L245062,u5533,m369,DEANNA,These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
189545,L245061,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!"
189546,L245060,u5533,m369,DEANNA,"Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!"
189547,L245059,u5538,m369,FREDO,Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
189548,L245058,u5533,m369,DEANNA,I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
189549,L245022,u5538,m369,FREDO,A hundred years...it's a toast.
189550,L245021,u5533,m369,DEANNA,What's 'cent' Anne?'
189551,L244891,u5538,m369,FREDO,He's the head of the family.
189552,L244890,u5533,m369,DEANNA,I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
189553,L244889,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party."
189554,L244888,u5533,m369,DEANNA,"Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me."
189555,L244887,u5538,m369,FREDO,Goddamn bitch.
189556,L244882,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Yeah, but I don't want him to see you."
189557,L244881,u5533,m369,DEANNA,"I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael."
189558,L244880,u5538,m369,FREDO,Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
189559,L246017,u5534,m369,DON CORLEONE,"I know.  I know, Michael.  It's Christmas, your brothers and sister are all here -- we are happy. Let's not spoil this.  Go your own way, but when you are ready, come to me the way a son should.  I have hopes for you..."
189560,L246016,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily."
189561,L246015,u5534,m369,DON CORLEONE,"Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you."
189562,L246014,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Not for strangers; for my country.
189563,L246013,u5534,m369,DON CORLEONE,You would risk your life for strangers?
189564,L246012,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,It's not talk; I'm doing it.
189565,L246011,u5534,m369,DON CORLEONE,Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
189566,L246010,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"No, Dad."
189567,L246009,u5534,m369,DON CORLEONE,Would you like some?
189568,L244841,u5535,m369,DON FRANCESCO,"He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge."
189569,L244840,u5560,m369,WIDOW,The child cannot harm you.
189570,L244839,u5535,m369,DON FRANCESCO,He will grow strong.
189571,L244838,u5560,m369,WIDOW,He is weak.
189572,L244837,u5535,m369,DON FRANCESCO,I'm not afraid of his words.
189573,L244836,u5560,m369,WIDOW,"Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks."
189574,L245184,u5536,m369,FANUCCI,"Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight."
189575,L245183,u5559,m369,VITO,I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
189576,L245182,u5536,m369,FANUCCI,I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
189577,L245159,u5536,m369,FANUCCI,You're a good fellow.
189578,L245158,u5559,m369,VITO,But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
189579,L245157,u5536,m369,FANUCCI,I understand...
189580,L245156,u5559,m369,VITO,"You must understand, this is all new to me..."
189581,L245155,u5536,m369,FANUCCI,"You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters."
189582,L245154,u5559,m369,VITO,My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
189583,L245153,u5536,m369,FANUCCI,"Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?"
189584,L245823,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,Let's go.
189585,L245822,u5537,m369,FBI MAN #1,"Ready, Frankie."
189586,L245798,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
189587,L245797,u5537,m369,FBI MAN #1,"Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?"
189588,L245794,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Yeah, some deal I made."
189589,L245793,u5537,m369,FBI MAN #1,We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
189590,L245792,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
189591,L245791,u5537,m369,FBI MAN #1,"Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans."
189592,L245790,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose."
189593,L244913,u5538,m369,FREDO,"C'mon, I see what I can do."
189594,L244912,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?"
189595,L244911,u5538,m369,FREDO,We were all upset about that.
189596,L244910,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh..."
189597,L244909,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times."
189598,L244908,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!"
189599,L244907,u5538,m369,FREDO,Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
189600,L245819,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?"
189601,L245818,u5538,m369,FREDO,"The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth."
189602,L245817,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
189603,L245816,u5538,m369,FREDO,"It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect."
189604,L245815,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,It's the way Pop wanted it.
189605,L245814,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!"
189606,L245813,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I've always taken care of you.
189607,L245812,u5538,m369,FREDO,He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
189608,L245811,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,And you believed that story.
189609,L245810,u5538,m369,FREDO,"I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you."
189610,L245809,u5538,m369,FREDO,"I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know."
189611,L245808,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?"
189612,L245807,u5538,m369,FREDO,I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
189613,L245806,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,We have time.
189614,L245805,u5538,m369,FREDO,"I don't have a lot to say, Michael."
189615,L245619,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?"
189616,L245618,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Fredo.  Where are you going?
189617,L245614,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,The old man will never bring in the New Year.
189618,L245613,u5538,m369,FREDO,What is it?  Can I help?
189619,L245612,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move."
189620,L245611,u5538,m369,FREDO,What do you want me to do?
189621,L245610,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever."
189622,L245609,u5538,m369,FREDO,"But, you told me yourself..."
189623,L245608,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli."
189624,L245607,u5538,m369,FREDO,...Who?
189625,L245606,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated."
189626,L245605,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother."
189627,L245604,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
189628,L245603,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike."
189629,L245602,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?"
189630,L245601,u5538,m369,FREDO,What's that?
189631,L245600,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms..."
189632,L245599,u5538,m369,FREDO,"You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family."
189633,L245598,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?"
189634,L245580,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman."
189635,L245579,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"You know otherwise, Freddie?"
189636,L245578,u5538,m369,FREDO,"No.  I mean, are you sure?"
189637,L245577,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
189638,L245576,u5538,m369,FREDO,"You?  What do you mean you, I thought..."
189639,L245575,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,It was hard to have him killed.
189640,L245574,u5538,m369,FREDO,"You?  What do you mean you, I thought..."
189641,L245573,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,It was hard to have him killed.
189642,L245572,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?"
189643,L245571,u5538,m369,FREDO,Wait'll you see!
189644,L245570,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,No.
189645,L245569,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book."
189646,L245561,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother."
189647,L245560,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time."
189648,L245531,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad."
189649,L245530,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days."
189650,L245529,u5538,m369,FREDO,Count on me; that's my specialty.
189651,L245528,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
189652,L245527,u5538,m369,FREDO,That's what I'm here for.
189653,L245526,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I want you to help me, Fredo."
189654,L245525,u5538,m369,FREDO,"No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it."
189655,L245524,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
189656,L245523,u5538,m369,FREDO,I never met them.
189657,L245522,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
189658,L245521,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?"
189659,L245520,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,We're making an investment in Havana.
189660,L245519,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark."
189661,L245518,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
189662,L245517,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Oh, 'scuse me."
189663,L245515,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Mio fratello.
189664,L245514,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Hiya, Freddie Corleone."
189665,L245068,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Forget it, just go take care of her."
189666,L245067,u5538,m369,FREDO,"Hey Mike, what can I say?"
189667,L245677,u5539,m369,GENCO,Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
189668,L245676,u5559,m369,VITO,Chi?
189669,L245675,u5539,m369,GENCO,The 'patrone' is here.
189670,L245115,u5539,m369,GENCO,"He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa."
189671,L245114,u5559,m369,VITO,And he agreed?
189672,L245113,u5539,m369,GENCO,What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
189673,L245111,u5539,m369,GENCO,"Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue."
189674,L245110,u5559,m369,VITO,Why?
189675,L245109,u5539,m369,GENCO,I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
189676,L245108,u5559,m369,VITO,"In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him."
189677,L245107,u5539,m369,GENCO,"Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad."
189678,L245106,u5559,m369,VITO,"No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?"
189679,L245105,u5539,m369,GENCO,Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
189680,L245104,u5559,m369,VITO,What?
189681,L245103,u5539,m369,GENCO,I bet you can't guess what happened?
189682,L245102,u5539,m369,GENCO,I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
189683,L245101,u5559,m369,VITO,"For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!"
189684,L245100,u5539,m369,GENCO,Beautiful.
189685,L245099,u5559,m369,VITO,Beautiful.
189686,L245098,u5539,m369,GENCO,Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
189687,L245097,u5559,m369,VITO,Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
189688,L245096,u5539,m369,GENCO,A pig of a Neaponitan.
189689,L245095,u5559,m369,VITO,He's an Italian?
189690,L245094,u5539,m369,GENCO,"I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father."
189691,L245482,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me."
189692,L245481,u5541,m369,KAY,When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
189693,L245480,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man."
189694,L245479,u5541,m369,KAY,"What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being."
189695,L245478,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem."
189696,L245477,u5541,m369,KAY,He's not the same as when I met him.
189697,L245476,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?"
189698,L245475,u5541,m369,KAY,"That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side."
189699,L245474,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did."
189700,L245473,u5541,m369,KAY,What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
189701,L245472,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Kay... Kay...
189702,L245471,u5541,m369,KAY,"... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?"
189703,L245279,u5540,m369,HAGEN,That's not the way we look at it.
189704,L245278,u5541,m369,KAY,Am I a prisoner?
189705,L245277,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay..."
189706,L245276,u5541,m369,KAY,How long does this go on?
189707,L245275,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with."
189708,L245274,u5541,m369,KAY,I'm going to see my parents.
189709,L245273,u5540,m369,HAGEN,That's off now.
189710,L245272,u5541,m369,KAY,I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
189711,L245271,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Within the compound will be fine.
189712,L245270,u5541,m369,KAY,I'm supposed to stay in my house.
189713,L245269,u5540,m369,HAGEN,It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
189714,L245902,u5540,m369,HAGEN,I don't know.
189715,L245901,u5554,m369,SANDRA,Will you tell him?
189716,L245900,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Yes.
189717,L245899,u5554,m369,SANDRA,You're going to talk to him now.
189718,L245407,u5554,m369,SANDRA,I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
189719,L245406,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Why didn't someone tell me!
189720,L245405,u5554,m369,SANDRA,"The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago."
189721,L245404,u5540,m369,HAGEN,What do you mean gone?
189722,L245403,u5554,m369,SANDRA,"She's gone, Tom."
189723,L245402,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Hello?
189724,L244995,u5540,m369,HAGEN,It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
189725,L244994,u5554,m369,SANDRA,Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
189726,L244993,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider."
189727,L244992,u5540,m369,HAGEN,I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
189728,L244991,u5554,m369,SANDRA,"We don't know that's true, he never said that."
189729,L244990,u5540,m369,HAGEN,He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
189730,L244988,u5554,m369,SANDRA,"With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house."
189731,L244987,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Where's my wife?
189732,L245418,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Yeah, give me a minute."
189733,L245417,u5550,m369,ROCCO,"Me too, Tom?"
189734,L245415,u5540,m369,HAGEN,I can't let him down.
189735,L245414,u5550,m369,ROCCO,She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
189736,L245412,u5550,m369,ROCCO,"I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that."
189737,L245411,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Goddamn it, where were you?"
189738,L245410,u5550,m369,ROCCO,I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
189739,L245409,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Rocco!
189740,L245923,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me."
189741,L245922,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Good.  Then you're staying.
189742,L245921,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you."
189743,L245920,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas."
189744,L245919,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer."
189745,L245918,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,They are everywhere!
189746,L245917,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
189747,L245916,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?"
189748,L245915,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him."
189749,L245914,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
189750,L245913,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI."
189751,L245912,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I want it met.
189752,L245911,u5540,m369,HAGEN,That plane goes to Miami...
189753,L245910,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
189754,L245909,u5540,m369,HAGEN,His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
189755,L245908,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million."
189756,L245905,u5540,m369,HAGEN,I know he's in Israel.
189757,L245904,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?"
189758,L245804,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
189759,L245803,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully."
189760,L245800,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury."
189761,L245799,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
189762,L245742,u5540,m369,HAGEN,I don't know.
189763,L245741,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
189764,L245740,u5540,m369,HAGEN,She took the Senate Investigation worse.
189765,L245739,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,And Kay...she's all right?
189766,L245738,u5540,m369,HAGEN,It was a boy.
189767,L245737,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!"
189768,L245736,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Mike, at three and a half..."
189769,L245735,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Was it a boy or a girl?
189770,L245734,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
189771,L245733,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Go on, tell me."
189772,L245732,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Alright.
189773,L245731,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Wait... there's something else.
189774,L245730,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,They can come in now.
189775,L245729,u5540,m369,HAGEN,My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
189776,L245728,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him."
189777,L245727,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York."
189778,L245726,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I asked about Fredo?
189779,L245725,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
189780,L245724,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Where's my brother?
189781,L245722,u5540,m369,HAGEN,A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
189782,L245721,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"What was it, so I'll know."
189783,L245720,u5540,m369,HAGEN,I took care of it.
189784,L245719,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
189785,L245716,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name."
189786,L245715,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
189787,L245237,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,If I'm wrong...
189788,L245236,u5540,m369,HAGEN,But if you're wrong...
189789,L245235,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you."
189790,L245234,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
189791,L245233,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate."
189792,L245231,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent."
189793,L245230,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Mikey, I hoped..."
189794,L245229,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother."
189795,L245228,u5540,m369,HAGEN,But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
189796,L245227,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything."
189797,L244971,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
189798,L244970,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"If you need anything, just..."
189799,L244969,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Sure, Mikey."
189800,L244968,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?"
189801,L244943,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Connie's outside.
189802,L244942,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
189803,L244941,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"I'm sorry; of course, you know that."
189804,L245907,u5540,m369,HAGEN,He's going to try Panama...
189805,L245906,u5546,m369,NERI,"The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down."
189806,L245391,u5546,m369,NERI,How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
189807,L245390,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don."
189808,L245389,u5546,m369,NERI,"I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him."
189809,L245388,u5540,m369,HAGEN,No questions.
189810,L245387,u5546,m369,NERI,What's up?
189811,L245382,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up."
189812,L245381,u5546,m369,NERI,We've never sent this much with one courier.
189813,L245380,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Mike wants it.
189814,L245379,u5546,m369,NERI,It might show.
189815,L245378,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Twenty-five this time.
189816,L245377,u5546,m369,NERI,Fifteen percent skim?
189817,L245949,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Thanks, Tom.  Thanks."
189818,L245948,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels."
189819,L245946,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Yeah, that was a good break.  A nice deal."
189820,L245945,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened."
189821,L245944,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes."
189822,L245943,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Yeah, it was once."
189823,L245942,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire."
189824,L245941,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked."
189825,L245940,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff."
189826,L245939,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then."
189827,L245938,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Tom, what do I do now?"
189828,L245937,u5540,m369,HAGEN,You're right.
189829,L245936,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
189830,L245935,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
189831,L245934,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned."
189832,L245933,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Yeah, but don't worry."
189833,L245932,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,Did my brother go back?
189834,L245931,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry."
189835,L245927,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air."
189836,L245926,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,The room has a bug in it.
189837,L245925,u5540,m369,HAGEN,I think I prefer to see my client privately.
189838,L245260,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,Thanks...friend.
189839,L245259,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
189840,L245258,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,And what's the price of their not finding out.
189841,L245257,u5540,m369,HAGEN,We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
189842,L245256,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
189843,L245255,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
189844,L245254,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
189845,L245252,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,"Maybe two, three thousand dollars."
189846,L245251,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Do you owe markers?
189847,L245250,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
189848,L245249,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Do you gamble?
189849,L245248,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
189850,L245247,u5540,m369,HAGEN,You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
189851,L245246,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,No strings.
189852,L245245,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings."
189853,L245244,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,What the hell are you talking about?
189854,L245243,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor."
189855,L245242,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,...and the tape will be running.
189856,L245842,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,The committee is adjourned until further notice.
189857,L245841,u5540,m369,HAGEN,This committee owes an apology!
189858,L245840,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,This meeting is adjourned.
189859,L245839,u5540,m369,HAGEN,Senator Kane.
189860,L245838,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,The witness is excused; take him out.
189861,L245837,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable."
189862,L245835,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"He is, I believe, a brother."
189863,L245834,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,Is he related to the witness?
189864,L245833,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli."
189865,L245832,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,"Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?"
189866,L245787,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,Very well.
189867,L245786,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record."
189868,L245785,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,I don't think that's necessary.
189869,L245784,u5540,m369,HAGEN,"Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record."
189870,L245266,u5544,m369,MAN,"Mr. Hagen's, ma'am."
189871,L245265,u5541,m369,KAY,Whose orders are these?
189872,L245264,u5544,m369,MAN,"If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want."
189873,L245263,u5541,m369,KAY,I'm going to the market.
189874,L245262,u5544,m369,MAN,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through."
189875,L245261,u5541,m369,KAY,Yes.
189876,L245878,u5541,m369,KAY,"It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!"
189877,L245877,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage."
189878,L245876,u5541,m369,KAY,The baby I lost...
189879,L245875,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I."
189880,L245874,u5541,m369,KAY,You haven't heard me.
189881,L245873,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
189882,L245872,u5541,m369,KAY,"At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has."
189883,L245871,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"If that's what it takes; then yes, I will."
189884,L245870,u5541,m369,KAY,"Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?"
189885,L245869,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!"
189886,L245868,u5541,m369,KAY,Michael.
189887,L245867,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave."
189888,L245866,u5541,m369,KAY,"Goodbye, Michael."
189889,L245865,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Kay, I told you..."
189890,L245864,u5541,m369,KAY,I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
189891,L245863,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers."
189892,L245862,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe."
189893,L245861,u5541,m369,KAY,You would have killed his brother?
189894,L245860,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor."
189895,L245859,u5541,m369,KAY,And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
189896,L245858,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,On a plane back to Sicily.
189897,L245857,u5541,m369,KAY,I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
189898,L245856,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,His brother came to help him.
189899,L245855,u5541,m369,KAY,"Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?"
189900,L245854,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Why too late?
189901,L245853,u5541,m369,KAY,"I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it."
189902,L245852,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
189903,L245851,u5541,m369,KAY,I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
189904,L245850,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Why don't you sit down?
189905,L245849,u5541,m369,KAY,In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
189906,L245848,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Where?
189907,L245847,u5541,m369,KAY,"I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here."
189908,L245846,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I had no idea...
189909,L245225,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
189910,L245224,u5541,m369,KAY,Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
189911,L245074,u5541,m369,KAY,"It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago."
189912,L245073,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
189913,L245072,u5541,m369,KAY,"Yes, Michael, it does."
189914,L245071,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Does it feel like a boy?
189915,L245070,u5541,m369,KAY,Sleeping inside me.
189916,L245069,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,How's the baby?
189917,L244985,u5541,m369,KAY,"Yes, Michael."
189918,L244984,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Kay.
189919,L244983,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute."
189920,L244982,u5541,m369,KAY,"I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?"
189921,L244981,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami."
189922,L244980,u5541,m369,KAY,"Anthony, Daddy's busy."
189923,L245084,u5542,m369,KLINGMAN,Get out of my hotel.
189924,L245083,u5546,m369,NERI,You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
189925,L245082,u5542,m369,KLINGMAN,"You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that."
189926,L245081,u5546,m369,NERI,You said you were Klingman.
189927,L245080,u5542,m369,KLINGMAN,Who do you think you're talking to?
189928,L245079,u5546,m369,NERI,I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
189929,L245078,u5542,m369,KLINGMAN,Right here.
189930,L245077,u5546,m369,NERI,Where can we talk?
189931,L245076,u5542,m369,KLINGMAN,Who's asking?
189932,L245075,u5546,m369,NERI,Are you Klingman?
189933,L245752,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,But times are different...
189934,L245751,u5543,m369,MAMA,Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
189935,L245750,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"No, I meant lose his family."
189936,L245749,u5543,m369,MAMA,You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
189937,L245748,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?"
189938,L245747,u5543,m369,MAMA,"Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?"
189939,L245746,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,There are still things I have to do.
189940,L245745,u5543,m369,MAMA,I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
189941,L245744,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?"
189942,L245549,u5552,m369,ROTH,"There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business."
189943,L245548,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
189944,L245547,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
189945,L245546,u5552,m369,ROTH,Why...the Rosato Brothers.
189946,L245545,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
189947,L245544,u5552,m369,ROTH,Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
189948,L245543,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?"
189949,L245542,u5552,m369,ROTH,"You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station."
189950,L245541,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
189951,L245540,u5552,m369,ROTH,Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
189952,L245539,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,This doubles my investment.
189953,L245464,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
189954,L245463,u5552,m369,ROTH,"If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible."
189955,L245462,u5552,m369,ROTH,Except the President of the United States.
189956,L245461,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I wouldn't consider anyone else.
189957,L245460,u5552,m369,ROTH,"Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner."
189958,L245459,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,The money was sent.
189959,L245458,u5552,m369,ROTH,My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
189960,L245457,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
189961,L245456,u5552,m369,ROTH,"You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy."
189962,L245451,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him."
189963,L245450,u5552,m369,ROTH,Enjoy.
189964,L245439,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
189965,L245438,u5552,m369,ROTH,"I still don't speak Spanish, Michael."
189966,L245317,u5552,m369,ROTH,Of course you must keep control of your family.
189967,L245316,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
189968,L245315,u5552,m369,ROTH,It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
189969,L245314,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
189970,L245313,u5552,m369,ROTH,Nothing is more important.
189971,L245312,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build."
189972,L245311,u5552,m369,ROTH,We do favors for each other...
189973,L245310,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
189974,L245309,u5552,m369,ROTH,However I can help you...
189975,L245308,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you."
189976,L245307,u5552,m369,ROTH,You're a considerate young man.
189977,L245306,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case."
189978,L245305,u5552,m369,ROTH,"What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money."
189979,L245304,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Yes.
189980,L245303,u5552,m369,ROTH,I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
189981,L245302,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Not for a few years.
189982,L245301,u5552,m369,ROTH,"Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?"
189983,L245454,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"So, that occurred to me."
189984,L245453,u5553,m369,SAM ROTH,So?
189985,L245452,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not."
189986,L245425,u5553,m369,SAM ROTH,"Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us."
189987,L245424,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Very impressive.
189988,L245423,u5553,m369,SAM ROTH,This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
189989,L245422,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"No, I'm fine."
189990,L245421,u5553,m369,SAM ROTH,"Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?"
189991,L245567,u5547,m369,OLA,Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
189992,L245566,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Let him gamble.
189993,L245565,u5547,m369,OLA,They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
189994,L244979,u5547,m369,OLA,"He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners."
189995,L244978,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around."
189996,L244977,u5547,m369,OLA,"The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you."
189997,L244976,u5547,m369,OLA,"He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect."
189998,L244975,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
189999,L244974,u5547,m369,OLA,Not good.
190000,L244973,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,How is his health?
190001,L244972,u5547,m369,OLA,I just left our friend in Miami.
190002,L244967,u5547,m369,OLA,"Sure, I remember Tom from the old days."
190003,L244966,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola."
190004,L245783,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I do not.
190005,L245782,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
190006,L245781,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I do not.
190007,L245780,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,"Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?"
190008,L245777,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock."
190009,L245776,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
190010,L245775,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,That is a complete falsehood.
190011,L245774,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,"Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?"
190012,L245773,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I deny his every charge.
190013,L245772,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
190014,L245771,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,No.
190015,L245770,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,"I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?"
190016,L245766,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Yes.
190017,L245765,u5557,m369,SENATOR KANE,Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
190018,L245376,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Good.
190019,L245375,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Sure, Mike.  I'll go along."
190020,L245374,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me."
190021,L245373,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle."
190022,L245372,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why."
190023,L245371,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
190024,L245370,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I know.
190025,L245369,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers."
190026,L245368,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
190027,L245367,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?"
190028,L245366,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Trust me; do as I ask.
190029,L245365,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that."
190030,L245364,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I want you to settle on their terms.
190031,L245363,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there."
190032,L245362,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
190033,L245361,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?"
190034,L245360,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I want you to help me take my revenge.
190035,L245359,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys."
190036,L245358,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Michael, yes, we was all relieved..."
190037,L245357,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
190038,L245356,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you."
190039,L245055,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,He did business...but he never trusted him.
190040,L245054,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him."
190041,L245053,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
190042,L245052,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
190043,L245051,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
190044,L245050,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
190045,L245049,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami."
190046,L245048,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean."
190047,L245047,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami."
190048,L245046,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!"
190049,L245045,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family."
190050,L245044,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,They feel cheated.
190051,L245043,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches."
190052,L245042,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched."
190053,L245041,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,Says who?
190054,L245040,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,You were unfair with them.
190055,L245039,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast."
190056,L245038,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
190057,L245037,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him."
190058,L245033,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,After dinner.
190059,L245032,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,When do we talk?
190060,L245031,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I know.
190061,L245015,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,"All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me."
190062,L245014,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family."
190063,L245013,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,"I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family."
190064,L245012,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?"
190065,L245010,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,"Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross..."
190066,L245009,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Turnbull is a good man.
190067,L245008,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,"The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name."
190068,L245006,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,Some water.
190069,L245005,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
190070,L245004,u5556,m369,SENATOR GEARY,I thought we would meet alone.
190071,L245003,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,"My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull."
190072,L245845,u5550,m369,ROCCO,"No, she's here."
190073,L245844,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,On the phone?
190074,L245217,u5550,m369,ROCCO,No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
190075,L245216,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,And?
190076,L245215,u5550,m369,ROCCO,Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
190077,L245213,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,It's important.
190078,L245212,u5550,m369,ROCCO,We'll try.
190079,L245211,u5545,m369,MICHAEL,Keep them alive.
190080,L245210,u5550,m369,ROCCO,They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
190081,L245495,u5551,m369,ROSATO,That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
190082,L245494,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,What's this?
190083,L245347,u5551,m369,ROSATO,"Maybe, yes... maybe no."
190084,L245346,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,He supports me.
190085,L245345,u5551,m369,ROSATO,What about Michael Corleone?
190086,L245344,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,I'm talking about Italians!
190087,L245343,u5551,m369,ROSATO,We got friends in the commission.
190088,L245342,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
190089,L245341,u5551,m369,ROSATO,We got no choice.
190090,L245340,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,You want a war?
190091,L245339,u5551,m369,ROSATO,Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
190092,L245338,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,What if I say shove it?
190093,L245337,u5551,m369,ROSATO,The same assurance we got from you.
190094,L245336,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?"
190095,L245335,u5551,m369,ROSATO,My lawyer went over this beforehand.
190096,L245334,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
190097,L245333,u5551,m369,ROSATO,"We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu."
190098,L245332,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?"
190099,L245331,u5551,m369,ROSATO,We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
190100,L245330,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,Don't I look like I'm listening?
190101,L245329,u5551,m369,ROSATO,"You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk."
190102,L245328,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around."
190103,L245327,u5551,m369,ROSATO,"You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?"
190104,L245326,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine."
190105,L245325,u5551,m369,ROSATO,"Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club."
190106,L245324,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,Are we going to eat or what?
190107,L245323,u5551,m369,ROSATO,We worked it all out beforehand.
190108,L245322,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,He don't want to talk?
190109,L245321,u5551,m369,ROSATO,Sitting right behind you.
190110,L245320,u5548,m369,PENTANGELI,"Rosato, where's your brother?"
190111,L245685,u5549,m369,ROBERTO,I won't keep you another minute...
190112,L245684,u5559,m369,VITO,I accept your generosity...
190113,L245683,u5549,m369,ROBERTO,"In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!"
190114,L245682,u5559,m369,VITO,What was that?
190115,L245681,u5549,m369,ROBERTO,"Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was."
190116,L245680,u5549,m369,ROBERTO,"What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent."
190117,L245679,u5559,m369,VITO,Yes.
190118,L245678,u5549,m369,ROBERTO,"Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone."
190119,L245653,u5549,m369,ROBERTO,Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
190120,L245652,u5559,m369,VITO,"Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog."
190121,L245651,u5549,m369,ROBERTO,Eh...  Five dollars more.
190122,L245650,u5559,m369,VITO,How much more a month?
190123,L245649,u5549,m369,ROBERTO,I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
190124,L245648,u5559,m369,VITO,"I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor."
190125,L245647,u5549,m369,ROBERTO,I have already rented the apartment to another family.
190126,L246406,u5562,m370,CLAY,Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
190127,L246405,u5561,m370,BETTY,Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
190128,L246404,u5562,m370,CLAY,So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
190129,L246403,u5561,m370,BETTY,"Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone."
190130,L246402,u5562,m370,CLAY,I like my life.  I'm a free man.
190131,L246401,u5561,m370,BETTY,What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
190132,L246400,u5562,m370,CLAY,I'm not a kid.
190133,L246399,u5561,m370,BETTY,"The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid."
190134,L246398,u5562,m370,CLAY,You mean us?
190135,L246397,u5561,m370,BETTY,"You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --"
190136,L246396,u5562,m370,CLAY,"If you enjoy it, you should do it."
190137,L246395,u5561,m370,BETTY,Sure.  I loved it.
190138,L246394,u5562,m370,CLAY,You liked it too.
190139,L246393,u5561,m370,BETTY,"No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you."
190140,L246392,u5562,m370,CLAY,I didn't mean to...
190141,L246391,u5561,m370,BETTY,It still hurt.  A lot.
190142,L246390,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other."
190143,L246389,u5561,m370,BETTY,You picked up that girl right in front of me.
190144,L246387,u5561,m370,BETTY,All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
190145,L246386,u5562,m370,CLAY,"He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex."
190146,L246385,u5561,m370,BETTY,It never crossed your mind?
190147,L246384,u5562,m370,CLAY,It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
190148,L246383,u5561,m370,BETTY,Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
190149,L246382,u5562,m370,CLAY,This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
190150,L246380,u5561,m370,BETTY,"Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette."
190151,L246379,u5562,m370,CLAY,I wasn't going to try anything.
190152,L246378,u5561,m370,BETTY,It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
190153,L246377,u5562,m370,CLAY,What's that mean?
190154,L246375,u5562,m370,CLAY,"If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like <u>my</u> famous person.  Yeah, my own personal famous person.  Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to."
190155,L246374,u5561,m370,BETTY,Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
190156,L246373,u5562,m370,CLAY,I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
190157,L246372,u5561,m370,BETTY,What's to be jealous of?
190158,L246371,u5562,m370,CLAY,You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
190159,L246363,u5561,m370,BETTY,Weird.
190160,L246362,u5562,m370,CLAY,So what did you think?
190161,L246345,u5561,m370,BETTY,Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
190162,L246344,u5562,m370,CLAY,Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
190163,L246343,u5561,m370,BETTY,"These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny."
190164,L246338,u5562,m370,CLAY,Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
190165,L246337,u5561,m370,BETTY,This looks corny.
190166,L246333,u5562,m370,CLAY,"We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie."
190167,L246332,u5561,m370,BETTY,Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
190168,L246331,u5562,m370,CLAY,Fuck you.
190169,L246330,u5561,m370,BETTY,"All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are."
190170,L246329,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself."
190171,L246328,u5561,m370,BETTY,Just thinking out loud.
190172,L246327,u5562,m370,CLAY,What makes you say that?
190173,L246320,u5562,m370,CLAY,Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
190174,L246319,u5561,m370,BETTY,I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
190175,L246318,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Thanks, doll."
190176,L246996,u5568,m370,HANNA,You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
190177,L246995,u5562,m370,CLAY,But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
190178,L246994,u5568,m370,HANNA,"Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone."
190179,L246993,u5562,m370,CLAY,We have his note.
190180,L246992,u5568,m370,HANNA,The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
190181,L246991,u5562,m370,CLAY,But I didn't do this!
190182,L246990,u5568,m370,HANNA,You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
190183,L246988,u5568,m370,HANNA,"He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life."
190184,L246987,u5562,m370,CLAY,"He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself."
190185,L246986,u5568,m370,HANNA,"Oh, Mr. Jimmy."
190186,L246985,u5562,m370,CLAY,I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
190187,L246978,u5562,m370,CLAY,I put him to bed.  He's not there?
190188,L246977,u5568,m370,HANNA,What have you done with him?
190189,L246975,u5568,m370,HANNA,It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
190190,L246974,u5562,m370,CLAY,Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
190191,L246973,u5568,m370,HANNA,What do I do?
190192,L246972,u5562,m370,CLAY,Thanks.  Why do you do it?
190193,L246971,u5568,m370,HANNA,I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
190194,L246970,u5562,m370,CLAY,Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
190195,L246969,u5568,m370,HANNA,There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
190196,L246968,u5562,m370,CLAY,I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
190197,L246967,u5568,m370,HANNA,I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
190198,L246966,u5562,m370,CLAY,It's not what you think.
190199,L246500,u5568,m370,HANNA,Yes.  I trust you.
190200,L246499,u5562,m370,CLAY,I'm not going to hurt anyone.
190201,L246498,u5568,m370,HANNA,Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
190202,L246497,u5562,m370,CLAY,No!
190203,L246496,u5568,m370,HANNA,You and he are not doing things?
190204,L246495,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Well...no, not really --"
190205,L246494,u5568,m370,HANNA,You did not know?
190206,L246493,u5562,m370,CLAY,You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
190207,L246492,u5568,m370,HANNA,That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
190208,L246491,u5568,m370,HANNA,Yes!  You know?
190209,L246490,u5562,m370,CLAY,A homo?
190210,L246489,u5568,m370,HANNA,What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
190211,L246488,u5568,m370,HANNA,No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
190212,L246487,u5562,m370,CLAY,Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
190213,L246486,u5568,m370,HANNA,This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
190214,L246485,u5562,m370,CLAY,You're sure of that?
190215,L246484,u5568,m370,HANNA,"No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad."
190216,L246483,u5562,m370,CLAY,Then you're as single as I am.
190217,L246482,u5568,m370,HANNA,"He is dead now, twenty years."
190218,L246481,u5562,m370,CLAY,Yeah?  What's your husband do?
190219,L246480,u5568,m370,HANNA,Of course.  I am married still.
190220,L246479,u5562,m370,CLAY,"You ever been married, Hanna?"
190221,L246477,u5562,m370,CLAY,You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
190222,L246476,u5568,m370,HANNA,A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
190223,L246475,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?"
190224,L246474,u5568,m370,HANNA,Why?
190225,L246473,u5562,m370,CLAY,I'm not married.
190226,L246472,u5568,m370,HANNA,Your wife?
190227,L246471,u5562,m370,CLAY,"You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri."
190228,L246470,u5568,m370,HANNA,"No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?"
190229,L246469,u5562,m370,CLAY,I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
190230,L246468,u5568,m370,HANNA,Long enough.  Fifteen years.
190231,L246467,u5562,m370,CLAY,How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
190232,L246466,u5562,m370,CLAY,"That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?"
190233,L246465,u5568,m370,HANNA,No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
190234,L246464,u5562,m370,CLAY,Tea is fine.
190235,L246463,u5568,m370,HANNA,The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
190236,L246462,u5568,m370,HANNA,Expect nothing fancy.
190237,L246461,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then."
190238,L246460,u5568,m370,HANNA,"The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask."
190239,L246459,u5562,m370,CLAY,Something I can do for you?
190240,L246263,u5562,m370,CLAY,You do that.
190241,L246262,u5568,m370,HANNA,No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
190242,L246261,u5562,m370,CLAY,Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
190243,L246260,u5568,m370,HANNA,You will not hurt him?
190244,L246259,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?"
190245,L246258,u5568,m370,HANNA,What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
190246,L246257,u5562,m370,CLAY,What're you talking about?
190247,L246256,u5568,m370,HANNA,I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
190248,L246255,u5562,m370,CLAY,"It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture."
190249,L246253,u5568,m370,HANNA,The Master is waiting for you.
190250,L246252,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --"
190251,L246961,u5572,m370,WHALE,Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
190252,L246960,u5562,m370,CLAY,You'll feel better tomorrow.
190253,L246959,u5572,m370,WHALE,When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
190254,L246958,u5562,m370,CLAY,All right.
190255,L246957,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I can undress myself, thank you."
190256,L246954,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Pray you, undo this button."
190257,L246953,u5562,m370,CLAY,Need some help?
190258,L246952,u5572,m370,WHALE,Nothing I didn't deserve.
190259,L246951,u5562,m370,CLAY,Did I hurt you?
190260,L246950,u5572,m370,WHALE,Oh Clayton.
190261,L246949,u5562,m370,CLAY,You okay?
190262,L246940,u5572,m370,WHALE,"No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share."
190263,L246939,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Look, if you want to die do it yourself!"
190264,L246937,u5562,m370,CLAY,You're crazy.
190265,L246936,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far."
190266,L246933,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?"
190267,L246932,u5562,m370,CLAY,I haven't done a damn thing with you!
190268,L246931,u5572,m370,WHALE,Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
190269,L246929,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Oh, but you feel good, Clayton."
190270,L246928,u5562,m370,CLAY,I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
190271,L246922,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word."
190272,L246921,u5562,m370,CLAY,Just take off the fucking mask!
190273,L246916,u5562,m370,CLAY,It's too tight.
190274,L246915,u5572,m370,WHALE,What was that?
190275,L246914,u5562,m370,CLAY,All right.  Let's take it off now.
190276,L246911,u5572,m370,WHALE,There are straps in back.
190277,L246910,u5562,m370,CLAY,"It's from the first World War, isn't it?"
190278,L246909,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect."
190279,L246908,u5562,m370,CLAY,I don't know.
190280,L246907,u5572,m370,WHALE,For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
190281,L246906,u5562,m370,CLAY,Why?
190282,L246904,u5572,m370,WHALE,Don't move.
190283,L246903,u5562,m370,CLAY,What did you expect?  Bronze?
190284,L246902,u5572,m370,WHALE,You are much too human.
190285,L246901,u5562,m370,CLAY,What won't do?
190286,L246900,u5572,m370,WHALE,No.  It won't do.
190287,L246899,u5562,m370,CLAY,What'd you say?
190288,L246898,u5572,m370,WHALE,So it is going to happen after all.
190289,L246895,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now."
190290,L246894,u5562,m370,CLAY,You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
190291,L246893,u5572,m370,WHALE,Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
190292,L246887,u5562,m370,CLAY,Your friend?
190293,L246886,u5572,m370,WHALE,Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
190294,L246885,u5562,m370,CLAY,You're planning a trip?
190295,L246884,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make."
190296,L246883,u5562,m370,CLAY,But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
190297,L246882,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps."
190298,L246881,u5562,m370,CLAY,"I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, ""The only monsters are here.""  I was wondering which here you meant."
190299,L246880,u5562,m370,CLAY,James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
190300,L246879,u5572,m370,WHALE,I don't remember that one.
190301,L246878,u5562,m370,CLAY,"That's from your movie, right? ""The only monsters are here."""
190302,L246877,u5572,m370,WHALE,"""A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."""
190303,L246876,u5562,m370,CLAY,Storm's getting worse.
190304,L246875,u5572,m370,WHALE,Not at all.
190305,L246874,u5562,m370,CLAY,Do you mind?
190306,L246873,u5572,m370,WHALE,"That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed."
190307,L246872,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup."
190308,L246871,u5572,m370,WHALE,I'm very sorry.
190309,L246870,u5562,m370,CLAY,You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
190310,L246868,u5562,m370,CLAY,I didn't have the guts for it.
190311,L246867,u5572,m370,WHALE,What happened?
190312,L246866,u5562,m370,CLAY,"I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself."
190313,L246865,u5572,m370,WHALE,Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
190314,L246864,u5562,m370,CLAY,"The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family."
190315,L246863,u5562,m370,CLAY,"That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family."
190316,L246862,u5572,m370,WHALE,A very lucky thing indeed.
190317,L246861,u5562,m370,CLAY,"By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out."
190318,L246860,u5572,m370,WHALE,The Great War?
190319,L246859,u5562,m370,CLAY,My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
190320,L246858,u5572,m370,WHALE,I see.
190321,L246857,u5562,m370,CLAY,-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
190322,L246856,u5572,m370,WHALE,But you said --
190323,L246855,u5562,m370,CLAY,I never made it to Korea.
190324,L246853,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing."
190325,L246852,u5562,m370,CLAY,Never gave it much thought.
190326,L246851,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?"
190327,L246850,u5562,m370,CLAY,Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
190328,L246849,u5572,m370,WHALE,I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
190329,L246848,u5562,m370,CLAY,I thought you'd given up on my picture.
190330,L246847,u5572,m370,WHALE,"After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?"
190331,L246845,u5572,m370,WHALE,The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
190332,L246844,u5562,m370,CLAY,Is that --?
190333,L246843,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Very sporting of you, Clayton."
190334,L246842,u5562,m370,CLAY,Do I have any other choice?
190335,L246841,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know."
190336,L246840,u5562,m370,CLAY,You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
190337,L246839,u5572,m370,WHALE,That only leaves the rest.
190338,L246835,u5562,m370,CLAY,No.  Definitely not.
190339,L246834,u5572,m370,WHALE,You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
190340,L246833,u5572,m370,WHALE,I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
190341,L246832,u5562,m370,CLAY,Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
190342,L246831,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?"
190343,L246824,u5562,m370,CLAY,Good.  Let's get dry.
190344,L246823,u5572,m370,WHALE,Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
190345,L246822,u5562,m370,CLAY,Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
190346,L246821,u5572,m370,WHALE,It's not like her.
190347,L246815,u5572,m370,WHALE,Catch my death.
190348,L246814,u5562,m370,CLAY,I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
190349,L246813,u5572,m370,WHALE,We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
190350,L246812,u5562,m370,CLAY,You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
190351,L246811,u5572,m370,WHALE,Let's get out of this funk hole
190352,L246808,u5562,m370,CLAY,Can't you see?  It's raining!
190353,L246807,u5572,m370,WHALE,Run for what?
190354,L246806,u5562,m370,CLAY,Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
190355,L246805,u5572,m370,WHALE,Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
190356,L246804,u5562,m370,CLAY,Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
190357,L246803,u5572,m370,WHALE,Neither of us really belongs here.
190358,L246802,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place."
190359,L246801,u5572,m370,WHALE,Are you enjoying yourself?
190360,L246735,u5572,m370,WHALE,David produced her last picture.
190361,L246734,u5562,m370,CLAY,Is that really her?
190362,L246733,u5572,m370,WHALE,Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
190363,L246732,u5562,m370,CLAY,No.  The girl.
190364,L246731,u5572,m370,WHALE,David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
190365,L246730,u5562,m370,CLAY,Who's that?
190366,L246729,u5572,m370,WHALE,Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
190367,L246728,u5562,m370,CLAY,What was that about?
190368,L246707,u5572,m370,WHALE,Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
190369,L246706,u5562,m370,CLAY,I don't hear anything.
190370,L246705,u5572,m370,WHALE,What did I tell you?  Listen.
190371,L246702,u5572,m370,WHALE,Nothing would please me more.
190372,L246701,u5562,m370,CLAY,If that's okay?
190373,L246700,u5572,m370,WHALE,I suppose you'd like the top down.
190374,L246698,u5562,m370,CLAY,Do I look okay?
190375,L246697,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Good afternoon, Clayton."
190376,L246675,u5562,m370,CLAY,Clayton is fine.
190377,L246674,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?"
190378,L246673,u5562,m370,CLAY,I'm game.  Sure.
190379,L246672,u5572,m370,WHALE,"If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused."
190380,L246670,u5562,m370,CLAY,You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
190381,L246669,u5572,m370,WHALE,It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
190382,L246668,u5562,m370,CLAY,No harm done.
190383,L246667,u5572,m370,WHALE,My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
190384,L246663,u5572,m370,WHALE,I want -- I want...
190385,L246662,u5562,m370,CLAY,I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
190386,L246661,u5572,m370,WHALE,Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
190387,L246658,u5572,m370,WHALE,Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
190388,L246657,u5562,m370,CLAY,You asked me to model.  Remember?
190389,L246656,u5572,m370,WHALE,"You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?"
190390,L246655,u5562,m370,CLAY,You're the one who started it.
190391,L246654,u5572,m370,WHALE,Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
190392,L246653,u5562,m370,CLAY,I didn't --
190393,L246652,u5572,m370,WHALE,You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
190394,L246648,u5562,m370,CLAY,Something happened to him?
190395,L246647,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy."
190396,L246645,u5572,m370,WHALE,"No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --"
190397,L246644,u5562,m370,CLAY,This was World War I?
190398,L246643,u5572,m370,WHALE,I was an officer.
190399,L246642,u5562,m370,CLAY,You were a soldier?
190400,L246641,u5572,m370,WHALE,Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
190401,L246640,u5562,m370,CLAY,You're talking through your hat now.
190402,L246639,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers."
190403,L246638,u5562,m370,CLAY,You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
190404,L246637,u5572,m370,WHALE,No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
190405,L246636,u5562,m370,CLAY,There's no people like you in my crowd.
190406,L246635,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?"
190407,L246634,u5562,m370,CLAY,Not fear.  More like disgust.
190408,L246633,u5572,m370,WHALE,And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
190409,L246632,u5562,m370,CLAY,I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
190410,L246631,u5572,m370,WHALE,What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
190411,L246630,u5562,m370,CLAY,Not me.
190412,L246629,u5572,m370,WHALE,Everybody has stories to tell.
190413,L246628,u5562,m370,CLAY,I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
190414,L246627,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?"
190415,L246625,u5562,m370,CLAY,I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
190416,L246624,u5572,m370,WHALE,Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
190417,L246607,u5572,m370,WHALE,Oh no.  I never swim.
190418,L246606,u5562,m370,CLAY,You first.
190419,L246605,u5572,m370,WHALE,The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
190420,L246600,u5562,m370,CLAY,"From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?"
190421,L246599,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --"
190422,L246598,u5562,m370,CLAY,Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
190423,L246596,u5562,m370,CLAY,Cut it out!
190424,L246595,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --"
190425,L246593,u5572,m370,WHALE,Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
190426,L246592,u5562,m370,CLAY,How long were you...?
190427,L246591,u5572,m370,WHALE,"But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely ""the friend.""  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer."
190428,L246590,u5572,m370,WHALE,Better work.
190429,L246589,u5562,m370,CLAY,You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
190430,L246588,u5572,m370,WHALE,I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
190431,L246586,u5572,m370,WHALE,It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
190432,L246585,u5562,m370,CLAY,Do you miss it?
190433,L246584,u5572,m370,WHALE,"After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?"
190434,L246583,u5572,m370,WHALE,"The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed."
190435,L246582,u5562,m370,CLAY,What happened?
190436,L246581,u5572,m370,WHALE,"You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done ""Show Boat."" Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  ""The Road Back.""  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece."
190437,L246580,u5572,m370,WHALE,"In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures."
190438,L246579,u5562,m370,CLAY,Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
190439,L246578,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing."
190440,L246577,u5562,m370,CLAY,Thoreau with a lawnmower.
190441,L246576,u5572,m370,WHALE,Ah.  A philosopher.
190442,L246575,u5562,m370,CLAY,"The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone."
190443,L246574,u5572,m370,WHALE,Very well put.
190444,L246573,u5562,m370,CLAY,You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
190445,L246572,u5572,m370,WHALE,Why not?
190446,L246571,u5562,m370,CLAY,Not at the moment.
190447,L246570,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?"
190448,L246569,u5572,m370,WHALE,Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
190449,L246568,u5562,m370,CLAY,"I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel."
190450,L246566,u5572,m370,WHALE,Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons.  Is that so much to ask?  Just two little buttons.
190451,L246565,u5562,m370,CLAY,I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
190452,L246564,u5572,m370,WHALE,Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
190453,L246562,u5562,m370,CLAY,I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
190454,L246561,u5572,m370,WHALE,But we have to match the other sketch.
190455,L246560,u5562,m370,CLAY,Sorry.  Not today.
190456,L246559,u5572,m370,WHALE,It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
190457,L246558,u5562,m370,CLAY,Can I see what you did so far?
190458,L246556,u5562,m370,CLAY,No.  I --
190459,L246555,u5572,m370,WHALE,I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
190460,L246554,u5562,m370,CLAY,"What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say."
190461,L246553,u5572,m370,WHALE,So we understand each other?
190462,L246552,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type."
190463,L246551,u5562,m370,CLAY,You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
190464,L246550,u5572,m370,WHALE,What way might that be?
190465,L246549,u5562,m370,CLAY,"You don't think of me that way, do you?"
190466,L246548,u5572,m370,WHALE,I never thought you were.
190467,L246547,u5562,m370,CLAY,"I'm not, you know."
190468,L246546,u5572,m370,WHALE,Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
190469,L246545,u5562,m370,CLAY,"No, I -- you're a homosexual."
190470,L246544,u5572,m370,WHALE,Does that surprise you?
190471,L246543,u5572,m370,WHALE,Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
190472,L246542,u5562,m370,CLAY,So you had a wife?
190473,L246541,u5572,m370,WHALE,No.  At least not in the legal sense.
190474,L246540,u5562,m370,CLAY,"You ever been married, Mr. Whale?"
190475,L246539,u5572,m370,WHALE,Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
190476,L246537,u5572,m370,WHALE,All righty.  I understand.
190477,L246536,u5562,m370,CLAY,Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
190478,L246535,u5572,m370,WHALE,I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
190479,L246534,u5562,m370,CLAY,Can't today.
190480,L246533,u5572,m370,WHALE,What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
190481,L246532,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega."
190482,L246531,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?"
190483,L246530,u5562,m370,CLAY,"No.  I could have, though."
190484,L246529,u5572,m370,WHALE,Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
190485,L246528,u5562,m370,CLAY,Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
190486,L246527,u5572,m370,WHALE,"It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of."
190487,L246526,u5562,m370,CLAY,I don't like to talk about that.
190488,L246525,u5572,m370,WHALE,Did you kill anyone?
190489,L246523,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood."
190490,L246522,u5562,m370,CLAY,Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
190491,L246521,u5572,m370,WHALE,Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
190492,L246520,u5562,m370,CLAY,No.
190493,L246519,u5572,m370,WHALE,Did anyone laugh?
190494,L246518,u5562,m370,CLAY,I liked it.  We all did.
190495,L246517,u5572,m370,WHALE,Did you now?
190496,L246516,u5562,m370,CLAY,Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
190497,L246513,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  Lunch should be ready.  Shall we?"
190498,L246512,u5562,m370,CLAY,This David's a friend?
190499,L246511,u5572,m370,WHALE,Is this David's doing?
190500,L246507,u5562,m370,CLAY,Go ahead.
190501,L246506,u5572,m370,WHALE,Do you mind?
190502,L246504,u5572,m370,WHALE,I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
190503,L246503,u5562,m370,CLAY,"All right, I guess."
190504,L246502,u5572,m370,WHALE,"How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch."
190505,L246306,u5562,m370,CLAY,I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
190506,L246305,u5572,m370,WHALE,"You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia."
190507,L246301,u5572,m370,WHALE,"In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them."
190508,L246300,u5562,m370,CLAY,I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
190509,L246299,u5572,m370,WHALE,"No, you were middle class, like all Americans."
190510,L246298,u5562,m370,CLAY,We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
190511,L246297,u5572,m370,WHALE,"There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?"
190512,L246296,u5572,m370,WHALE,I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me.
190513,L246295,u5562,m370,CLAY,What?
190514,L246294,u5572,m370,WHALE,I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
190515,L246293,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --"
190516,L246292,u5562,m370,CLAY,Your family ate dripping?
190517,L246291,u5572,m370,WHALE,It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
190518,L246290,u5562,m370,CLAY,Sounds like something you feed the dog.
190519,L246289,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread."
190520,L246288,u5572,m370,WHALE,"It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you."
190521,L246287,u5562,m370,CLAY,No.  I'm fine.
190522,L246286,u5572,m370,WHALE,Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
190523,L246284,u5572,m370,WHALE,That's exactly what I intend to do.
190524,L246283,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Take a picture, it lasts longer."
190525,L246280,u5562,m370,CLAY,All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
190526,L246279,u5572,m370,WHALE,We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
190527,L246278,u5572,m370,WHALE,Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
190528,L246277,u5562,m370,CLAY,But it's just my face you want to draw.
190529,L246276,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly."
190530,L246275,u5562,m370,CLAY,I'm not wearing an undershirt.
190531,L246274,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?"
190532,L246273,u5562,m370,CLAY,It's new.
190533,L246272,u5572,m370,WHALE,"That shirt, Mr. Boone."
190534,L246270,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Hmmm.  I much prefer ""Show Boat"" or ""The Invisible Man.""  Shall we begin?"
190535,L246269,u5562,m370,CLAY,"""Bride of Frankenstein."""
190536,L246268,u5572,m370,WHALE,You don't say?  Which picture?
190537,L246267,u5562,m370,CLAY,Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
190538,L246239,u5572,m370,WHALE,Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
190539,L246238,u5562,m370,CLAY,All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
190540,L246237,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that."
190541,L246236,u5562,m370,CLAY,"You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?"
190542,L246235,u5572,m370,WHALE,What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
190543,L246234,u5562,m370,CLAY,And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
190544,L246233,u5572,m370,WHALE,Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
190545,L246232,u5562,m370,CLAY,But why?
190546,L246231,u5572,m370,WHALE,Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
190547,L246230,u5562,m370,CLAY,You mean -- you really want to draw me?
190548,L246229,u5572,m370,WHALE,I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
190549,L246228,u5572,m370,WHALE,Yes.  You were a Marine.
190550,L246227,u5562,m370,CLAY,Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
190551,L246226,u5572,m370,WHALE,You went to university?
190552,L246225,u5562,m370,CLAY,Football in college.
190553,L246224,u5572,m370,WHALE,But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
190554,L246223,u5562,m370,CLAY,Broke is more like it.
190555,L246222,u5572,m370,WHALE,You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
190556,L246221,u5562,m370,CLAY,What's to sketch?
190557,L246220,u5572,m370,WHALE,Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
190558,L246219,u5562,m370,CLAY,"You mean, like posed for pictures?"
190559,L246218,u5572,m370,WHALE,"To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?"
190560,L246217,u5562,m370,CLAY,Huh?
190561,L246216,u5572,m370,WHALE,"You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head."
190562,L246215,u5572,m370,WHALE,Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
190563,L246214,u5562,m370,CLAY,What was wrong?
190564,L246213,u5572,m370,WHALE,I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
190565,L246212,u5562,m370,CLAY,What did she mean by going flooey?
190566,L246211,u5572,m370,WHALE,"When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself."
190567,L246202,u5572,m370,WHALE,Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
190568,L246201,u5562,m370,CLAY,Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
190569,L246200,u5572,m370,WHALE,I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
190570,L246199,u5562,m370,CLAY,"""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of"" and ""Son of"" and all the rest?"
190571,L246198,u5562,m370,CLAY,Really?
190572,L246197,u5572,m370,WHALE,"This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the ""Frankenstein"" pictures."
190573,L246196,u5562,m370,CLAY,Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
190574,L246195,u5572,m370,WHALE,"In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here."
190575,L246194,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?"
190576,L246193,u5572,m370,WHALE,"But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?"
190577,L246192,u5562,m370,CLAY,They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
190578,L246191,u5572,m370,WHALE,They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
190579,L246190,u5562,m370,CLAY,I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
190580,L246189,u5572,m370,WHALE,You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
190581,L246188,u5562,m370,CLAY,"Excuse me, but -- are you famous?"
190582,L246187,u5572,m370,WHALE,What?  Oh yes.
190583,L246186,u5562,m370,CLAY,These are your paintings?
190584,L246183,u5572,m370,WHALE,Splendid.
190585,L246182,u5562,m370,CLAY,No.  Iced tea's fine.
190586,L246181,u5572,m370,WHALE,Or would you prefer a beer?
190587,L246180,u5572,m370,WHALE,The honest sweat of one's brow.  I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
190588,L246179,u5562,m370,CLAY,I stink to high heaven right now.
190589,L246178,u5572,m370,WHALE,I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
190590,L246177,u5562,m370,CLAY,Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
190591,L246176,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Everything alright, Mr. Boone?"
190592,L246053,u5562,m370,CLAY,Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
190593,L246052,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it."
190594,L246051,u5572,m370,WHALE,The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
190595,L246050,u5562,m370,CLAY,Just that I was in the Marines.
190596,L246049,u5572,m370,WHALE,I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
190597,L246048,u5562,m370,CLAY,Boone.  Clayton Boone.
190598,L246047,u5572,m370,WHALE,And your name is --?
190599,L246046,u5562,m370,CLAY,Nice place.
190600,L246045,u5572,m370,WHALE,My name is Whale.  This is my house.
190601,L246044,u5562,m370,CLAY,Mornin'.
190602,L246043,u5572,m370,WHALE,Good morning.
190603,L246619,u5562,m370,CLAY,Have a drink?
190604,L246618,u5565,m370,DWIGHT,"Hey, Boone."
190605,L246367,u5562,m370,CLAY,I think I'll hang around.
190606,L246366,u5565,m370,DWIGHT,"You coming, Boone?"
190607,L246324,u5565,m370,DWIGHT,Ooooh.
190608,L246323,u5562,m370,CLAY,This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
190609,L246310,u5565,m370,DWIGHT,You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
190610,L246309,u5562,m370,CLAY,I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
190611,L246165,u5565,m370,DWIGHT,"Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me."
190612,L246164,u5562,m370,CLAY,I'm up.  Thanks.
190613,L246163,u5565,m370,DWIGHT,"You told me to get you up, asshole."
190614,L246162,u5562,m370,CLAY,Fuck off!
190615,L246161,u5565,m370,DWIGHT,Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
190616,L246615,u5569,m370,HARRY,She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
190617,L246614,u5562,m370,CLAY,Where's Betty?
190618,L246369,u5562,m370,CLAY,I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
190619,L246368,u5569,m370,HARRY,"Go home, Clay.  We're closing up."
190620,L246356,u5562,m370,CLAY,"The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?"
190621,L246355,u5569,m370,HARRY,Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
190622,L246351,u5562,m370,CLAY,"I just want to watch it, okay?"
190623,L246350,u5569,m370,HARRY,"You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay."
190624,L246335,u5562,m370,CLAY,Good.  Fine.
190625,L246334,u5569,m370,HARRY,"Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it."
190626,L246313,u5569,m370,HARRY,I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
190627,L246312,u5562,m370,CLAY,"If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?"
190628,L246311,u5569,m370,HARRY,Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
190629,L246758,u5563,m370,DAVID,"All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast."
190630,L246757,u5572,m370,WHALE,Yes.  Perfectly.
190631,L246756,u5563,m370,DAVID,"Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?"
190632,L246755,u5572,m370,WHALE,Then who did?
190633,L246754,u5563,m370,DAVID,I didn't ask George to invite you.
190634,L246753,u5572,m370,WHALE,No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
190635,L246752,u5563,m370,DAVID,Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
190636,L246751,u5572,m370,WHALE,But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
190637,L246750,u5563,m370,DAVID,You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
190638,L246749,u5572,m370,WHALE,Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
190639,L246748,u5563,m370,DAVID,You only embarrass yourself.
190640,L246747,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume."
190641,L246746,u5563,m370,DAVID,"You didn't, Jimmy."
190642,L246745,u5572,m370,WHALE,You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
190643,L246743,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Oh, David, stop being a nanny."
190644,L246742,u5563,m370,DAVID,Should you be drinking in your condition?
190645,L246738,u5563,m370,DAVID,"I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception."
190646,L246737,u5572,m370,WHALE,Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
190647,L246736,u5563,m370,DAVID,What are you doing here?
190648,L246036,u5563,m370,DAVID,"Goodbye, Hanna."
190649,L246035,u5572,m370,WHALE,Thank you.
190650,L246034,u5563,m370,DAVID,"By the way, I like the Renoir."
190651,L246033,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane."
190652,L246032,u5563,m370,DAVID,You remember how a production eats up one's life.
190653,L246031,u5572,m370,WHALE,"""The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."""
190654,L246030,u5563,m370,DAVID,"I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --"
190655,L246029,u5572,m370,WHALE,I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
190656,L246028,u5563,m370,DAVID,Then take the pills.
190657,L246027,u5572,m370,WHALE,"It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --"
190658,L246026,u5563,m370,DAVID,She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
190659,L246251,u5572,m370,WHALE,You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
190660,L246250,u5564,m370,DR. PAYNE,"Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on."
190661,L246249,u5572,m370,WHALE,So what do I do?
190662,L246248,u5564,m370,DR. PAYNE,"In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related."
190663,L246247,u5572,m370,WHALE,But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
190664,L246246,u5564,m370,DR. PAYNE,That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
190665,L246245,u5572,m370,WHALE,You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
190666,L246244,u5564,m370,DR. PAYNE,The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
190667,L246243,u5564,m370,DR. PAYNE,That's what I'm trying to explain.
190668,L246242,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?"
190669,L246241,u5564,m370,DR. PAYNE,"You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired."
190670,L246434,u5567,m370,ERNEST THESIGER,My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
190671,L246433,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,More your line.
190672,L246432,u5567,m370,ERNEST THESIGER,I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
190673,L246431,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,"In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper."
190674,L246430,u5567,m370,ERNEST THESIGER,"Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours."
190675,L246429,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
190676,L246428,u5567,m370,ERNEST THESIGER,"My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers."
190677,L246798,u5572,m370,WHALE,Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
190678,L246797,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,"We'll be in touch, Jimmy."
190679,L246782,u5572,m370,WHALE,Oh dear.
190680,L246781,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
190681,L246780,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,What's our pesky friend up to now?
190682,L246779,u5572,m370,WHALE,Of course.
190683,L246778,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,"I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes."
190684,L246777,u5572,m370,WHALE,Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
190685,L246776,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
190686,L246775,u5572,m370,WHALE,"But you appear quite fresh, my dear."
190687,L246774,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
190688,L246773,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old."
190689,L246772,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
190690,L246771,u5572,m370,WHALE,Elsa?
190691,L246770,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,Jimmy.  How are you?
190692,L246424,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil."
190693,L246423,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
190694,L246420,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,Boris?  Do I look a fright?
190695,L246419,u5572,m370,WHALE,Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
190696,L246418,u5566,m370,ELSA LANCHESTER,"Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?"
190697,L246695,u5568,m370,HANNA,No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
190698,L246694,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like."
190699,L246693,u5568,m370,HANNA,"That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short."
190700,L246689,u5568,m370,HANNA,It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
190701,L246688,u5572,m370,WHALE,It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
190702,L246687,u5572,m370,WHALE,Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
190703,L246686,u5568,m370,HANNA,I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
190704,L246685,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?"
190705,L246684,u5568,m370,HANNA,No.  But someone you can talk to.
190706,L246683,u5572,m370,WHALE,I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
190707,L246682,u5568,m370,HANNA,Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
190708,L246622,u5568,m370,HANNA,A visitor.
190709,L246621,u5572,m370,WHALE,Who was that at the door?
190710,L246458,u5568,m370,HANNA,Of course.  This afternoon.
190711,L246457,u5572,m370,WHALE,Does the yardman come today?
190712,L246413,u5568,m370,HANNA,Good night.
190713,L246412,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you."
190714,L246411,u5568,m370,HANNA,"You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?"
190715,L246359,u5572,m370,WHALE,She is beautiful.
190716,L246358,u5568,m370,HANNA,She is horrible.
190717,L246353,u5572,m370,WHALE,"No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black."
190718,L246352,u5568,m370,HANNA,He is not going to kill the old man?
190719,L246342,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable."
190720,L246341,u5568,m370,HANNA,"Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?"
190721,L246210,u5572,m370,WHALE,Go.
190722,L246209,u5568,m370,HANNA,He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
190723,L246208,u5572,m370,WHALE,Just go.  We can manage without you.
190724,L246207,u5568,m370,HANNA,I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
190725,L246206,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard."
190726,L246205,u5568,m370,HANNA,You remember what the doctor tells us.
190727,L246204,u5572,m370,WHALE,My mind's lovely.  And yours?
190728,L246203,u5568,m370,HANNA,"How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?"
190729,L246160,u5572,m370,WHALE,No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
190730,L246159,u5568,m370,HANNA,Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
190731,L246158,u5572,m370,WHALE,Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
190732,L246157,u5568,m370,HANNA,I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
190733,L246156,u5572,m370,WHALE,"You must think I'm terrible, Hanna."
190734,L246151,u5572,m370,WHALE,Luminal.
190735,L246150,u5568,m370,HANNA,Which ones?  I bring them all.
190736,L246066,u5572,m370,WHALE,Yes?
190737,L246065,u5568,m370,HANNA,"Mr. Kay, sir."
190738,L246064,u5572,m370,WHALE,Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
190739,L246063,u5568,m370,HANNA,"Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting."
190740,L246062,u5572,m370,WHALE,"There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?"
190741,L246041,u5568,m370,HANNA,Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
190742,L246040,u5572,m370,WHALE,Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
190743,L246769,u5570,m370,KAY,Don't go away.
190744,L246768,u5572,m370,WHALE,My monsters?
190745,L246767,u5570,m370,KAY,"Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters."
190746,L246766,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs."
190747,L246765,u5570,m370,KAY,"I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary."
190748,L246764,u5572,m370,WHALE,"You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?"
190749,L246763,u5570,m370,KAY,I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
190750,L246762,u5572,m370,WHALE,You didn't?
190751,L246761,u5570,m370,KAY,Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
190752,L246760,u5572,m370,WHALE,Mr....Kay?
190753,L246155,u5570,m370,KAY,Right.
190754,L246154,u5572,m370,WHALE,I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
190755,L246153,u5570,m370,KAY,I was going to take a swim.
190756,L246147,u5572,m370,WHALE,Head.  Not heart.
190757,L246146,u5570,m370,KAY,"Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?"
190758,L246145,u5572,m370,WHALE,I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
190759,L246144,u5570,m370,KAY,Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
190760,L246140,u5572,m370,WHALE,You think so?  That's very kind --
190761,L246139,u5570,m370,KAY,He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
190762,L246138,u5572,m370,WHALE,"My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef."
190763,L246137,u5570,m370,KAY,Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
190764,L246136,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one."
190765,L246135,u5572,m370,WHALE,Righto.  Let me see.
190766,L246134,u5570,m370,KAY,"Okay.  ""Frankenstein.""  Tell me everything."
190767,L246133,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste."
190768,L246132,u5570,m370,KAY,"Just like going swimming, isn't it?"
190769,L246131,u5570,m370,KAY,I can't believe I'm doing this.
190770,L246130,u5572,m370,WHALE,Of course.
190771,L246129,u5570,m370,KAY,Can that count as one question?
190772,L246128,u5570,m370,KAY,"Will you tell me everything you remember about making ""Frankenstein""?"
190773,L246127,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?"
190774,L246126,u5570,m370,KAY,Can we talk about the horror movies now?
190775,L246124,u5570,m370,KAY,I guess.
190776,L246123,u5572,m370,WHALE,Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
190777,L246122,u5572,m370,WHALE,Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
190778,L246121,u5570,m370,KAY,"George Cukor?  Who made ""A Star Is Born""?  I never guessed."
190779,L246120,u5572,m370,WHALE,"You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?"
190780,L246119,u5570,m370,KAY,"Too warm for a sweater, anyway."
190781,L246113,u5572,m370,WHALE,"A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks."
190782,L246112,u5570,m370,KAY,"That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal."
190783,L246111,u5572,m370,WHALE,What rumors might those be?
190784,L246110,u5570,m370,KAY,Then the rumors are true?
190785,L246109,u5572,m370,WHALE,Quite.
190786,L246108,u5570,m370,KAY,You're serious.
190787,L246107,u5572,m370,WHALE,"It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?"
190788,L246106,u5570,m370,KAY,"That's funny, Mr. Whale."
190789,L246105,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing."
190790,L246104,u5570,m370,KAY,I don't mind.
190791,L246103,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?"
190792,L246101,u5570,m370,KAY,No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
190793,L246100,u5572,m370,WHALE,"I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay."
190794,L246099,u5570,m370,KAY,But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
190795,L246098,u5572,m370,WHALE,Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
190796,L246097,u5570,m370,KAY,"Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --"

190798,L246095,u5570,m370,KAY,"How much longer before we get to ""Frankenstein""?"
190799,L246094,u5572,m370,WHALE,"There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called ""Journey's End"".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  ""Journey's End"" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned."
190800,L246090,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one."
190801,L246089,u5570,m370,KAY,Your father was a schoolmaster?

190805,L246084,u5572,m370,WHALE,"So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?"
190806,L246081,u5570,m370,KAY,Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
190807,L246080,u5572,m370,WHALE,This is the studio where I paint.
190808,L246078,u5572,m370,WHALE,After you then.
190809,L246077,u5570,m370,KAY,Sure.
190810,L246076,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?"
190811,L246075,u5572,m370,WHALE,Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
190812,L246074,u5570,m370,KAY,"That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  ""Bride of Frankenstein."""
190813,L246072,u5570,m370,KAY,I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
190814,L246071,u5572,m370,WHALE,One likes to live simply.
190815,L246070,u5570,m370,KAY,And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
190816,L246069,u5572,m370,WHALE,No.  I expect you can't.
190817,L246068,u5570,m370,KAY,"Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you."
190818,L246719,u5571,m370,PRINCESS MARGARET,"I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know."
190819,L246718,u5572,m370,WHALE,"Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale."
190820,L246717,u5571,m370,PRINCESS MARGARET,Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
190821,L246716,u5571,m370,PRINCESS MARGARET,"I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now."

190823,L246714,u5571,m370,PRINCESS MARGARET,Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
190824,L246713,u5571,m370,PRINCESS MARGARET,Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
190825,L246712,u5572,m370,WHALE,Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
190826,L246711,u5571,m370,PRINCESS MARGARET,How are you?
190827,L248695,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Point-five ...
190828,L248694,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,"Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?"
190829,L248685,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?
190830,L248684,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"My version of ""take this job and shove it..."""

190833,L248048,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,Yeah -- ?
190834,L248047,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
190835,L248046,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,"Me, too. Every time I walk..."
190836,L248045,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I think about that night a lot...
190837,L248044,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,"No, but you dress like an asshole ..."
190838,L248043,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce"
190839,L248042,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,"I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?"
190840,L248041,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
190841,L248040,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,"I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ..."
190842,L248039,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of ""Karaoke."""
190843,L248038,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
190844,L248037,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Fish.

190846,L248035,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,What's with the fish thing -- ?
190847,L247911,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,The business has changed...
190848,L247910,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Jesus ...
190849,L247909,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...

190851,L247818,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Who was the job for?
190852,L247817,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,"The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense."
190853,L247816,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley..."
190854,L247815,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
190855,L247814,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,It seems she neglected to mention it
190856,L247812,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
190857,L247811,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,A boost. A big boost ...
190858,L247810,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,What kind of job... ?
190859,L247809,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
190860,L247808,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Tell me about Kip -
190861,L247807,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,"Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ..."

190865,L247801,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,What about?
190866,L247800,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,Is there someplace we can talk?
190867,L247799,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,What are you doing here?
190868,L247798,u5573,m371,ATLEY JACKSON,Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
190869,L247797,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,How's the leg?
190870,L248681,u5574,m371,CALITRI,"Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ..."
190871,L248680,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,You got no choice. It's over.
190872,L248679,u5574,m371,CALITRI,Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...
190873,L248678,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,What do you mean -- ?
190874,L248677,u5574,m371,CALITRI,"Well, that certainly won't do."
190875,L248675,u5574,m371,CALITRI,"I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ..."
190876,L248674,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him..."
190877,L248673,u5574,m371,CALITRI,But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
190878,L248672,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
190879,L248671,u5574,m371,CALITRI,Right there -
190880,L248670,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
190881,L248669,u5574,m371,CALITRI,"Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ..."
190882,L248418,u5574,m371,CALITRI,I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
190883,L248417,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Get out --
190884,L248416,u5574,m371,CALITRI,One more night --
190885,L248415,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Get out of here, Ray --"
190886,L248410,u5574,m371,CALITRI,Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
190887,L248409,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
190888,L248408,u5574,m371,CALITRI,This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
190889,L247936,u5574,m371,CALITRI,"""don't want"" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things..."
190890,L247935,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
190891,L247929,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,And if he doesn't make it -- ?
190892,L247928,u5574,m371,CALITRI,Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
190893,L247927,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Sound it out for me.
190894,L247926,u5574,m371,CALITRI,"I knew you'd say that, too --"
190895,L247925,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I'm just here about my brother.
190896,L247924,u5574,m371,CALITRI,I knew you'd say that.
190897,L247923,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I'm not interested --
190898,L247922,u5574,m371,CALITRI,"They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ..."
190899,L247921,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,They gave you only four days?
190900,L247920,u5574,m371,CALITRI,Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
190901,L247919,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
190902,L247918,u5574,m371,CALITRI,"Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ..."
190903,L247917,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
190904,L247916,u5574,m371,CALITRI,"My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them..."
190905,L247913,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I don't want him hurt...
190906,L247912,u5574,m371,CALITRI,"Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip."
190907,L247904,u5574,m371,CALITRI,Yes ... Kip ...
190908,L247903,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,It's about my brother ... Kip...
190909,L247900,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,How ya doing?

190912,L248575,u5576,m371,DETECTIVE DRYCOFF,What for?
190913,L248574,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
190914,L248573,u5576,m371,DETECTIVE DRYCOFF,He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
190915,L248572,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,How is he?
190916,L248571,u5576,m371,DETECTIVE DRYCOFF,They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...

190925,L248709,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,I know you.
190926,L248379,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
190927,L248378,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,What do you want from me?
190928,L248377,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,"Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ..."

190933,L248222,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
190934,L248217,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,Something like that -
190935,L248216,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?"
190936,L248207,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.

Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ..."
190941,L247955,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,And this has what to do with me?
190942,L247954,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,"Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ..."

190944,L247952,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,Or your baby brother. What was his name?

190953,L247747,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,I don't golf...
190954,L247746,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially..."
190955,L247745,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,You'll leave -- ?

190957,L247743,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,How's that?
190958,L247742,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Let them go --
190959,L247741,u5575,m371,DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK,"Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --"

190989,L248543,u5577,m371,DONNY ASTRICKY,"Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy..."

191003,L248273,u5577,m371,DONNY ASTRICKY,"It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?"
191004,L248272,u5578,m371,FREB,okay ...
191005,L248271,u5577,m371,DONNY ASTRICKY,"You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles."
191006,L248270,u5578,m371,FREB,I guess ...
191007,L248268,u5578,m371,FREB,What's that?
191008,L248267,u5577,m371,DONNY ASTRICKY,"You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -"
191009,L248266,u5578,m371,FREB,It just ain't happening --
191010,L248185,u5577,m371,DONNY ASTRICKY,"Well, that defies the point, don't it?"
191011,L248184,u5578,m371,FREB,Keys were in it ...
191012,L248183,u5577,m371,DONNY ASTRICKY,How'd it go?
191013,L248329,u5577,m371,DONNY ASTRICKY,Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...

191021,L248112,u5581,m371,KIP,"Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ..."
191022,L248111,u5577,m371,DONNY ASTRICKY,You guys have any skills at all?
191023,L248099,u5581,m371,KIP,"Hey, Donny --"

191331,L248469,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
191332,L248468,u5585,m371,SWAY,"So, you seeing anybody?"
191333,L248466,u5585,m371,SWAY,Deodorant.
191334,L248465,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?"
191335,L248459,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
191336,L248458,u5585,m371,SWAY,What the hell's that -- ?
191337,L248457,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,No. Open her ...

191341,L248373,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Oh. Okay. Right.
191342,L248372,u5585,m371,SWAY,"Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!"
191343,L248371,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,No ...
191344,L248370,u5585,m371,SWAY,No ... ?
191345,L248369,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,No way ...
191346,L248368,u5585,m371,SWAY,"Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process."
191347,L248367,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Very good...
191348,L248366,u5585,m371,SWAY,"We were good when you bailed, weren't we?"
191349,L248365,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I always thought you'd follow me up.
191350,L248364,u5585,m371,SWAY,You mentioned that in your letters
191351,L248363,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Okay.
191352,L248362,u5585,m371,SWAY,That's what I want ...
191353,L248361,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,That what you want?
191354,L248360,u5585,m371,SWAY,I go with you --
191355,L248359,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
191356,L248358,u5585,m371,SWAY,She's trouble --
191357,L248354,u5585,m371,SWAY,"Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ..."
191358,L248353,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
191359,L248352,u5585,m371,SWAY,"She was the only ""Annie"" you could find?"
191360,L248351,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
191361,L248348,u5585,m371,SWAY,The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
191362,L248347,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,What's wrong with her -- ?
191363,L248346,u5585,m371,SWAY,Hey.
191364,L248286,u5585,m371,SWAY,Hey -
191365,L248285,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her ""Sway."""
191366,L248176,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
191367,L248175,u5585,m371,SWAY,What the hell are you doing -- ?
191368,L248166,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I understand -
191369,L248165,u5585,m371,SWAY,"I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ..."
191370,L248164,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Six or seven...
191371,L248163,u5585,m371,SWAY,And you got some Italians -- ?
191372,L248162,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
191373,L248161,u5585,m371,SWAY,What kind of trouble -- ?
191374,L248160,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Kip's in trouble
191375,L248159,u5585,m371,SWAY,Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
191376,L248158,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,And here I am...
191377,L248157,u5585,m371,SWAY,A distinction worth noting ...
191378,L248156,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I left town. I didn't leave you.
191379,L248155,u5585,m371,SWAY,"No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?"
191380,L248154,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?"
191381,L248153,u5585,m371,SWAY,On account of me.
191382,L248152,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,On account of Mitch?
191383,L248149,u5585,m371,SWAY,No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
191384,L248148,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,So I was replaced by Mitch?
191385,L248147,u5585,m371,SWAY,Mitch.
191386,L248146,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"""Mitch?"""

191389,L248143,u5585,m371,SWAY,"Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ..."
191390,L248142,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
191391,L248141,u5585,m371,SWAY,You look like you lost your sheep ...
191392,L248140,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old..."
191393,L248139,u5585,m371,SWAY,What's with the look?
191394,L248138,u5585,m371,SWAY,What are you doing here?
191395,L248137,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
191396,L248739,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I'll see you soon --
191397,L248738,u5584,m371,OTTO,Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
191398,L248728,u5584,m371,OTTO,She left...
191399,L248727,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,What happened to Sway?
191400,L248726,u5584,m371,OTTO,He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
191401,L248725,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Split it up. Any word on Donny?
191402,L248334,u5584,m371,OTTO,"Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?"
191403,L248333,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
191404,L248332,u5584,m371,OTTO,"Anyone? The significance of ""Robin 1"" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?"
191405,L248119,u5584,m371,OTTO,"In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And..."
191406,L248118,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Okay, then... Otto?"
191407,L248106,u5584,m371,OTTO,"The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be."
191408,L248105,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
191409,L248104,u5584,m371,OTTO,"I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days..."
191410,L248103,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,No we don't -
191411,L248102,u5584,m371,OTTO,You need him...
191412,L248090,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?"
191413,L248089,u5584,m371,OTTO,Some crew you got ...
191414,L248075,u5584,m371,OTTO,Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
191415,L248074,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,And the moral of that story is -- ?
191416,L248073,u5584,m371,OTTO,"I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ..."
191417,L248072,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
191418,L248071,u5584,m371,OTTO,"The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -"
191419,L248070,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Is he still working here ?
191420,L248069,u5584,m371,OTTO,"""A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..."" Nietzsche said that."
191421,L248068,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,The hard part ...
191422,L248067,u5584,m371,OTTO,It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
191423,L248066,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,Tell me...
191424,L248065,u5584,m371,OTTO,Are you considering a comeback tour?
191425,L248064,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,You think it can be done?
191426,L248062,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,He's gotten involved --
191427,L248061,u5584,m371,OTTO,I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
191428,L248059,u5584,m371,OTTO,"What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to..."
191429,L248058,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
191430,L248057,u5584,m371,OTTO,Whatever do you mean?
191431,L248054,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Of course. Hi, Junie --"
191432,L248053,u5584,m371,OTTO,You remember Junie?
191433,L248052,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Hello, Otto ..."
191434,L248051,u5584,m371,OTTO,Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
191435,L248607,u5586,m371,TOBY,No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
191436,L248606,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up..."
191437,L248451,u5586,m371,TOBY,You sure I can't go with ya?
191438,L248450,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?"
191439,L248404,u5586,m371,TOBY,"Come on. Kip, talk to the guy"
191440,L248403,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ..."
191441,L248402,u5586,m371,TOBY,How come ... ?
191442,L248401,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
191443,L248400,u5586,m371,TOBY,What about me?
191444,L248264,u5586,m371,TOBY,"I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between ""FRIENDS"" and ""SEINFELD""..."
191445,L248263,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,So what's in there -- ?
191446,L248262,u5586,m371,TOBY,"I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want."
191447,L248253,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,She soars -
191448,L248252,u5586,m371,TOBY,So she flies -
191449,L248251,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
191450,L248246,u5582,m371,MEMPHIS,"All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say ""Eleanor lives at such and such... "" and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ..."

191478,L248998,u5598,m372,MICKEY,No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
191479,L248997,u5589,m372,ANGIE,"But he was always a bad kid, that one."
191480,L248996,u5598,m372,MICKEY,The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
191481,L248995,u5589,m372,ANGIE,What? What happened?
191482,L248994,u5598,m372,MICKEY,Look at Jeannie's kid.

191487,L248769,u5590,m372,BILLY,"Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box."
191488,L248768,u5602,m372,TOMMY,Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
191489,L248767,u5590,m372,BILLY,"Listen to him.  ""Watch the suit,"" he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big."

191495,L249389,u5603,m372,VARIO,Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
191496,L249388,u5603,m372,VARIO,You treated me like shit.
191497,L249387,u5591,m372,HENRY,Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
191498,L249386,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong."
191499,L249385,u5603,m372,VARIO,You thought I was some fucking jerk?
191500,L249384,u5591,m372,HENRY,"But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together..."
191501,L249383,u5603,m372,VARIO,Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
191502,L249382,u5591,m372,HENRY,"It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie."
191503,L249381,u5603,m372,VARIO,You think I didn't know what you were doing?
191504,L249380,u5591,m372,HENRY,I've been all fucked up since I got out.
191505,L249379,u5603,m372,VARIO,I warned you a million times.
191506,L249165,u5591,m372,HENRY,I understand.
191507,L249164,u5603,m372,VARIO,Anybody!  You understand?
191508,L249163,u5591,m372,HENRY,Nods again.
191509,L249162,u5603,m372,VARIO,"And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me."
191510,L249161,u5591,m372,HENRY,Nods.
191511,L249160,u5603,m372,VARIO,"You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?"
191512,L249159,u5591,m372,HENRY,Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
191513,L249158,u5603,m372,VARIO,I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
191514,L249153,u5591,m372,HENRY,Why would I get into that?
191515,L249152,u5603,m372,VARIO,"I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here."
191516,L249151,u5591,m372,HENRY,Me? Why would I get into that shit?
191517,L249150,u5603,m372,VARIO,Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
191518,L249149,u5591,m372,HENRY,Wha?  Me?
191519,L249148,u5603,m372,VARIO,I don't want any more of that Shit.
191520,L249036,u5591,m372,HENRY,Oh I Him.
191521,L249035,u5603,m372,VARIO,No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
191522,L249034,u5591,m372,HENRY,The guy from near where Christie used to live?
191523,L249033,u5603,m372,VARIO,No. No. The guy from downtown.
191524,L249032,u5591,m372,HENRY,What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
191525,L249031,u5603,m372,VARIO,What did you hear about that thing?
191526,L248891,u5603,m372,VARIO,What?
191527,L248890,u5591,m372,HENRY,Tell him. It's okay.
191528,L249434,u5591,m372,HENRY,Yeah. What about the kids' school?
191529,L249433,u5594,m372,KAREN,What about the schools?
191530,L249409,u5594,m372,KAREN,I got scared.
191531,L249408,u5591,m372,HENRY,Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
191532,L249407,u5594,m372,KAREN,I got seared.
191533,L249406,u5591,m372,HENRY,What happened? You okay?
191534,L249377,u5594,m372,KAREN,Oh no! No!  Noooo!
191535,L249376,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?"
191536,L249375,u5594,m372,KAREN,They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
191537,L249374,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money."
191538,L249373,u5594,m372,KAREN,What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
191539,L249372,u5591,m372,HENRY,You what?
191540,L249371,u5594,m372,KAREN,I flushed it down the toilet.
191541,L249370,u5591,m372,HENRY,You know. The stuff I left.
191542,L249369,u5594,m372,KAREN,What are you talking about?
191543,L249368,u5591,m372,HENRY,Where's the stuff?
191544,L249367,u5591,m372,HENRY,So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
191545,L249364,u5591,m372,HENRY,Just get me out.
191546,L249363,u5594,m372,KAREN,Who's gonna do that?
191547,L249362,u5591,m372,HENRY,Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
191548,L249361,u5594,m372,KAREN,Then you're safer in here.
191549,L249360,u5591,m372,HENRY,Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
191550,L249359,u5594,m372,KAREN,I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
191551,L249358,u5591,m372,HENRY,Paul will calm down. You'll see.
191552,L249357,u5594,m372,KAREN,At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
191553,L249356,u5591,m372,HENRY,"What did he say, exactly?"
191554,L249355,u5594,m372,KAREN,Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
191555,L249194,u5591,m372,HENRY,Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
191556,L249193,u5594,m372,KAREN,"She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her."
191557,L249192,u5591,m372,HENRY,I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
191558,L249147,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie."
191559,L249146,u5594,m372,KAREN,But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
191560,L249145,u5591,m372,HENRY,Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
191561,L249144,u5594,m372,KAREN,With what?
191562,L249143,u5591,m372,HENRY,Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
191563,L249142,u5591,m372,HENRY,Never.
191564,L249141,u5594,m372,KAREN,I don't want to hear about her anymore.
191565,L249140,u5591,m372,HENRY,Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
191566,L249139,u5594,m372,KAREN,I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
191567,L249138,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody."
191568,L249137,u5594,m372,KAREN,I can't do it anymore.
191569,L249136,u5591,m372,HENRY,It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
191570,L249135,u5594,m372,KAREN,"Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him."
191571,L249134,u5591,m372,HENRY,We've got to help each other.
191572,L249133,u5594,m372,KAREN,He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
191573,L249132,u5591,m372,HENRY,It'll be okay.
191574,L249131,u5594,m372,KAREN,"Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?"
191575,L249130,u5594,m372,KAREN,Let her carry this shit inside.
191576,L249129,u5591,m372,HENRY,Stop! Stop!
191577,L249126,u5591,m372,HENRY,What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
191578,L249125,u5594,m372,KAREN,You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
191579,L249124,u5591,m372,HENRY,Jezuz Christ!
191580,L249123,u5594,m372,KAREN,Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
191581,L249122,u5591,m372,HENRY,What are you talking about?
191582,L249121,u5594,m372,KAREN,You son of a bitch. She's been here.
191583,L249108,u5591,m372,HENRY,Shit.
191584,L249107,u5594,m372,KAREN,I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
191585,L249106,u5591,m372,HENRY,I'm just having my last few drinks.
191586,L249105,u5594,m372,KAREN,I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
191587,L249085,u5591,m372,HENRY,Son of a bitch.
191588,L249084,u5594,m372,KAREN,"The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?"
191589,L249083,u5591,m372,HENRY,"It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do."
191590,L249080,u5591,m372,HENRY,What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
191591,L249079,u5594,m372,KAREN,Henry.  Wake up.
191592,L249066,u5591,m372,HENRY,That again.
191593,L249065,u5594,m372,KAREN,I don't care. Something's going on.
191594,L249018,u5591,m372,HENRY,How much?
191595,L249017,u5594,m372,KAREN,I'm gonna need some money.
191596,L249002,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car."
191597,L249001,u5594,m372,KAREN,"I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --"
191598,L248969,u5591,m372,HENRY,Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
191599,L248968,u5594,m372,KAREN,The bag with the envelopes.
191600,L248967,u5591,m372,HENRY,What bag?
191601,L248966,u5594,m372,KAREN,My bag. My bag.
191602,L248957,u5591,m372,HENRY,Get inside!
191603,L248956,u5594,m372,KAREN,What are you gonna do?
191604,L248955,u5591,m372,HENRY,Go inside. I'll be right there.
191605,L248934,u5594,m372,KAREN,They don't feel like you're in construction.
191606,L248933,u5591,m372,HENRY,I'm in construction.
191607,L248932,u5594,m372,KAREN,What do you do?
191608,L248927,u5591,m372,HENRY,He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
191609,L248926,u5594,m372,KAREN,What're you doing? What about the car?
191610,L248921,u5591,m372,HENRY,I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
191611,L248920,u5594,m372,KAREN,Talk? To you? After what you did!
191612,L248919,u5591,m372,HENRY,"She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said."
191613,L248918,u5591,m372,HENRY,Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
191614,L248917,u5594,m372,KAREN,Liar!
191615,L248916,u5591,m372,HENRY,"I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week."
191616,L248909,u5591,m372,HENRY,"I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check."
191617,L248908,u5594,m372,KAREN,Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
191618,L248907,u5591,m372,HENRY,I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
191619,L249422,u5592,m372,JIMMY,"I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case."
191620,L249421,u5591,m372,HENRY,Yeah.
191621,L249420,u5592,m372,JIMMY,"He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida."
191622,L249419,u5591,m372,HENRY,Yeah.
191623,L249418,u5592,m372,JIMMY,It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
191624,L249417,u5591,m372,HENRY,How?
191625,L249416,u5592,m372,JIMMY,I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
191626,L249415,u5591,m372,HENRY,"He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck."
191627,L249414,u5591,m372,HENRY,"I can't eat,  just get me some coffee."
191628,L249304,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye."
191629,L249303,u5592,m372,JIMMY,What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
191630,L249295,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country."
191631,L249294,u5592,m372,JIMMY,I better call again.
191632,L249293,u5591,m372,HENRY,Nah.
191633,L249292,u5592,m372,JIMMY,You want the melon?
191634,L249285,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction."
191635,L249284,u5592,m372,JIMMY,I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
191636,L249283,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?"
191637,L249282,u5592,m372,JIMMY,Watch this.
191638,L249281,u5592,m372,JIMMY,Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
191639,L249280,u5591,m372,HENRY,What'll I tell Fran?
191640,L249264,u5592,m372,JIMMY,Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
191641,L249263,u5591,m372,HENRY,Paulie's gonna make him?
191642,L249258,u5592,m372,JIMMY,So what?  Where are they gonna go?
191643,L249257,u5591,m372,HENRY,There are cops all over the place.
191644,L249256,u5592,m372,JIMMY,Don't worry about it.
191645,L249255,u5591,m372,HENRY,What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
191646,L249254,u5592,m372,JIMMY,Oh yeah? Anything you say.
191647,L249252,u5592,m372,JIMMY,Have a drink first.
191648,L249251,u5591,m372,HENRY,I gotta talk to you.
191649,L249250,u5592,m372,JIMMY,Give'm a drink.
191650,L249237,u5592,m372,JIMMY,We did it.  We did it.
191651,L249236,u5591,m372,HENRY,Jimmy.
191652,L249235,u5592,m372,JIMMY,For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
191653,L249098,u5592,m372,JIMMY,We only have to shove'em over the moat.
191654,L249097,u5591,m372,HENRY,What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
191655,L249096,u5592,m372,JIMMY,we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
191656,L249050,u5592,m372,JIMMY,"Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems."
191657,L249049,u5591,m372,HENRY,"If Paulie finds out, we got problems."
191658,L249048,u5592,m372,JIMMY,It's still better than letting somebody find him.
191659,L249047,u5591,m372,HENRY,It's been six months.
191660,L249046,u5592,m372,JIMMY,The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
191661,L249045,u5591,m372,HENRY,What?
191662,L249044,u5592,m372,JIMMY,"Well, we gotta dig him up again."
191663,L249043,u5591,m372,HENRY,Paulie was just talking about him.
191664,L249042,u5592,m372,JIMMY,"We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?"

191666,L248950,u5592,m372,JIMMY,"You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?"
191667,L248853,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast."
191668,L248852,u5592,m372,JIMMY,Keep 'em coming.
191669,L248788,u5592,m372,JIMMY,Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.

191671,L249234,u5591,m372,HENRY,"Marty, please. Let me talk to him."

191678,L249178,u5596,m372,MARTY,It's a fait accompli?
191679,L248947,u5591,m372,HENRY,What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
191680,L248946,u5596,m372,MARTY,I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
191681,L248847,u5591,m372,HENRY,I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.

191685,L248822,u5591,m372,HENRY,My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
191686,L248821,u5601,m372,TODDY,"Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?"

191822,L250067,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way."
191823,L250066,u5621,m373,WILL,"Thanks, Chuck."
191824,L250063,u5621,m373,WILL,I was countin' on it.
191825,L250062,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?"
191826,L250061,u5621,m373,WILL,I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
191827,L249939,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,I don't know.
191828,L249938,u5621,m373,WILL,Why not?
191829,L249937,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,I didn't get on Cathy last night.
191830,L249921,u5621,m373,WILL,No one. I didn't have the number.
191831,L249920,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Who'd you call?
191832,L249678,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,You're fuckin' good.
191833,L249677,u5621,m373,WILL,"Probation, counselin', few days a week."
191834,L249676,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,What'd you get? You get leniency?
191835,L249552,u5621,m373,WILL,Next week.
191836,L249551,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,When's the arraignment?
191837,L249546,u5621,m373,WILL,"Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich."
191838,L249545,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Hey, thanks for comin' out."
191839,L249537,u5621,m373,WILL,I don't know yet.
191840,L249536,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,What do we got?
191841,L249531,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"No, and we got four of 'em."
191842,L249530,u5621,m373,WILL,"Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?"
191843,L249527,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Jesus Christ. Not even close.
191844,L249526,u5621,m373,WILL,She didn't do it again did she?
191845,L249512,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"We're not goin'.  I don't even like ""Kelly's."""
191846,L249511,u5621,m373,WILL,She's sharp as a marble.
191847,L249487,u5621,m373,WILL,Fuck you.
191848,L249486,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in."
191849,L249485,u5621,m373,WILL,What are we gonna do up there?
191850,L249484,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
191851,L249483,u5621,m373,WILL,Stop crowdin the plate!
191852,L249482,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Stop brushin' me back!
191853,L249473,u5621,m373,WILL,--or a tail--
191854,L249472,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Yeah, so he's like ""Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something""--"
191855,L249457,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat--"
191856,L249456,u5621,m373,WILL,"Chuckie, what the fuck happened?"
191857,L250207,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Yeah, it is."
191858,L250206,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Is that true?
191859,L250203,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--"
191860,L250202,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me."
191861,L250201,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Well, I don't have no trousers on..."
191862,L250200,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?"
191863,L250199,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"You caught that, huh?"
191864,L250198,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--"
191865,L250197,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
191866,L250196,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Okay.
191867,L250195,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
191868,L250194,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Is this a bad time?
191869,L250193,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that."
191870,L250192,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,I guess so.
191871,L250189,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"This is your house, right?"
191872,L250188,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Oh, right."
191873,L250187,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
191874,L250186,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,How'd you know where to find me?
191875,L250185,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Good.
191876,L250184,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,How you doin'?
191877,L250183,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Hi.
191878,L250072,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,I wanted to meet your brothers...
191879,L250071,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit."
191880,L250060,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
191881,L250059,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people."
191882,L249585,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Yah, it's not a bad school..."
191883,L249584,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Oh...
191884,L249583,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Ah, history I think."
191885,L249582,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,What class?
191886,L249579,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"So, you ladies ah, go to school here?"
191887,L249578,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Okay.
191888,L250447,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
191889,L250446,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?"
191890,L250445,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day."
191891,L250437,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in."
191892,L250436,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday."
191893,L250435,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Shut the fuck up.
191894,L250434,u5612,m373,MORGAN,What'd you say about me?
191895,L250428,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Oh, Morgan."
191896,L250427,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before."
191897,L250426,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you."
191898,L250282,u5612,m373,MORGAN,I don't have a VCR at my house.
191899,L250281,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Why don't you beat off at your house?
191900,L250280,u5612,m373,MORGAN,What's up guys?
191901,L250065,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car."
191902,L250064,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Chuck, let's go."
191903,L250058,u5612,m373,MORGAN,I'm Irish.
191904,L250057,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
191905,L250055,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
191906,L250054,u5612,m373,MORGAN,Did your Uncle get arrested?
191907,L250051,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, ""Is there a problem?"" And the Statie's like ""I pulled you over and you took off."" And my Uncle's like ""I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids."" And Statie's like ""Let me get in your garage!"" So he's like ""All right, fine."" He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage."
191908,L250050,u5612,m373,MORGAN,Holy shit.
191909,L250049,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes ""Stay here"" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, ""Fuck it."" He gets in his car and drives home."
191910,L250048,u5612,m373,MORGAN,Some other guy?
191911,L249572,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"I told you ""no"" yesterday!"
191912,L249571,u5612,m373,MORGAN,What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
191913,L249570,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
191914,L249565,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--"
191915,L249564,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch."
191916,L249542,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'."
191917,L249541,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Morgan, Let's go."
191918,L249540,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' now, I'm eatin' my snack. WILL  So don't go."
191919,L249539,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Shut up.
191920,L249538,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Come on, Will..."
191921,L249529,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
191922,L249528,u5612,m373,MORGAN,Did she get my Double Burger?
191923,L249525,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,I think you should establish a good line of credit.
191924,L249524,u5612,m373,MORGAN,Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
191925,L249523,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
191926,L249522,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"I told you, I just got change."
191927,L249521,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,How much money you got?
191928,L249520,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Yah, all right..."
191929,L249519,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"What do you mean ""your sandwhich?"" I bought it."
191930,L249518,u5612,m373,MORGAN,So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
191931,L249517,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!"
191932,L249510,u5612,m373,MORGAN,She's not stupid.
191933,L249509,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to ""Kelly's."" It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once."
191934,L249508,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Morgan, I'm not goin' to ""Kelly's Roast Beef"" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?"
191935,L249505,u5612,m373,MORGAN,Fuck her.
191936,L249504,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?"
191937,L249503,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Fuck this, let's get something to eat..."
191938,L249497,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,You could put a pool in that backyard.
191939,L249496,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Yah, that is a nice ass."
191940,L249475,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
191941,L249474,u5612,m373,MORGAN,WILL!
191942,L249468,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' ""I'm sorry."" BANG, ""I'm sorry."" BANG!"
191943,L249467,u5612,m373,MORGAN,Jesus.
191944,L249459,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"--and he's like ""shit! Motherfucker!"" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--"
191945,L249458,u5612,m373,MORGAN,--That isn't funny--
191946,L250150,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest."
191947,L250149,u5609,m373,EXECUTIVE,Will you take a check?
191948,L250148,u5609,m373,EXECUTIVE,I have about seventy-three...
191949,L250147,u5609,m373,EXECUTIVE,I don't think I...Larry?
191950,L250146,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now."
191951,L250145,u5609,m373,EXECUTIVE,You want us to give you cash right now?
191952,L250144,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,Retainer...
191953,L250143,u5609,m373,EXECUTIVE,"Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits."
191954,L250140,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
191955,L250139,u5609,m373,EXECUTIVE,I'm not sure--
191956,L249596,u5607,m373,CLARK,There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
191957,L249595,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"All right, are we gonna have a problem?"
191958,L249594,u5607,m373,CLARK,"Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch."
191959,L249593,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary."
191960,L249592,u5607,m373,CLARK,"Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to ""seize"" the opportunity to ask you a question."
191961,L249591,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time."
191962,L249590,u5607,m373,CLARK,"History? Just ""history?"" It must have been a survey course then."
191963,L249589,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,"Good, it was all right."
191964,L249588,u5607,m373,CLARK,How'd you like that course?
191965,L249587,u5606,m373,CHUCKIE,History.
191966,L249586,u5607,m373,CLARK,What class did you say that was?
191967,L250278,u5621,m373,WILL,Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
191968,L250277,u5608,m373,DYTRESS,"That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't ""why should you work for N.S.A."" it's ""why shouldn't you?"""
191969,L250276,u5621,m373,WILL,"Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A."
191970,L250275,u5608,m373,DYTRESS,That's one aspect of what we do.
191971,L250274,u5621,m373,WILL,Codebreaking.
191972,L250273,u5608,m373,DYTRESS,"Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--"
191973,L250272,u5621,m373,WILL,So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
191974,L249740,u5610,m373,HYPNOTIST,"You don't have to be nervous, Will."
191975,L249739,u5621,m373,WILL,Down there.  And I'm nervous.
191976,L249738,u5610,m373,HYPNOTIST,Where is it touching you?
191977,L249737,u5621,m373,WILL,It's touching me.
191978,L249736,u5610,m373,HYPNOTIST,"You're in a safe place, Will."
191979,L249735,u5621,m373,WILL,"It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer."
191980,L249734,u5610,m373,HYPNOTIST,What is it?
191981,L249733,u5621,m373,WILL,Somethin's in my room.
191982,L249732,u5610,m373,HYPNOTIST,And what do you see?
191983,L249731,u5621,m373,WILL,Seven.
191984,L249730,u5610,m373,HYPNOTIST,"Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?"
191985,L250022,u5613,m373,PEKEC,--But--
191986,L250021,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"--Maker builds ""K"" to the ""N."" N is three to the K times--"
191987,L250018,u5613,m373,PEKEC,The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
191988,L250017,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"No, there's a limit."
191989,L250016,u5613,m373,PEKEC,"Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!"
191990,L250015,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--"
191991,L250014,u5613,m373,PEKEC,With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
191992,L250013,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing..."
191993,L249639,u5618,m373,TERRY,"Well, he didn't show up for work today..."
191994,L249638,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important."
191995,L249637,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint."
191996,L249636,u5618,m373,TERRY,"Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it."
191997,L249635,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Building two.
191998,L249634,u5618,m373,TERRY,Which one's your building?
191999,L249633,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--"
192000,L249632,u5618,m373,TERRY,No students work for me.
192001,L249631,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
192002,L249630,u5618,m373,TERRY,"Yeah, can I help you?"
192003,L249629,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
192004,L250481,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Thank you, Will. I'll do that."
192005,L250480,u5621,m373,WILL,"Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call."
192006,L250479,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Yes.
192007,L250478,u5621,m373,WILL,I appreciate that.
192008,L250477,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
192009,L250476,u5621,m373,WILL,Bullshit.
192010,L250475,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
192011,L250474,u5621,m373,WILL,Thank you.
192012,L250473,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
192013,L250472,u5621,m373,WILL,I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
192014,L250471,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"You know, you're no longer required to come here."
192015,L250470,u5621,m373,WILL,"Hey, how you doin'?"
192016,L250469,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Will.
192017,L250390,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving."
192018,L250389,u5621,m373,WILL,I can come back.
192019,L250291,u5621,m373,WILL,It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
192020,L250290,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,What are you smiling at?
192021,L250227,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away."
192022,L250226,u5621,m373,WILL,"Well, I'm sorry."
192023,L250225,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now."
192024,L250224,u5621,m373,WILL,--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
192025,L250223,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
192026,L250222,u5621,m373,WILL,--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
192027,L250221,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
192028,L250220,u5621,m373,WILL,Then don't set up any more meetings.
192029,L250219,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me."
192030,L250218,u5621,m373,WILL,I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
192031,L250217,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?"
192032,L250216,u5621,m373,WILL,It's right.  Take it home with you.
192033,L250215,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"That's fine, but did you ever think--"
192034,L250214,u5621,m373,WILL,"Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--"
192035,L250213,u5621,m373,WILL,I'm pretty sure it's right.
192036,L250212,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
192037,L250211,u5621,m373,WILL,I don't know what it's called.
192038,L250210,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
192039,L249830,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting."
192040,L249829,u5621,m373,WILL,No.
192041,L249750,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,That's enough.
192042,L249749,u5621,m373,WILL,Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
192043,L249748,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Get out, Will."
192044,L249747,u5621,m373,WILL,"C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work."
192045,L249746,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,I told you to cooperate with these people.
192046,L249745,u5621,m373,WILL,"Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun."
192047,L249744,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Oh, for God's sake, Will."
192048,L249728,u5621,m373,WILL,"Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes."
192049,L249727,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Shall we start the, uh..."
192050,L249725,u5621,m373,WILL,An integer.
192051,L249724,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,--That edge!
192052,L249723,u5621,m373,WILL,"--Half-red, half-black--"
192053,L249722,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,--that?--
192054,L249721,u5621,m373,WILL,"Half-red, half-black--"
192055,L249720,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,What's that?
192056,L249718,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,I happen to know so.
192057,L249717,u5621,m373,WILL,I think so.
192058,L249716,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?"
192059,L249715,u5621,m373,WILL,It's an integer proof.
192060,L249714,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Okay. How?
192061,L249713,u5621,m373,WILL,Of course.
192062,L249712,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
192063,L249672,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail."
192064,L249671,u5621,m373,WILL,I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
192065,L249670,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,That's right.
192066,L249669,u5621,m373,WILL,"If I agree to this, I walk right now?"
192067,L249668,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,That you meet with me twice a week--
192068,L249667,u5621,m373,WILL,What're those?
192069,L249666,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Yes. Under two conditions.
192070,L249665,u5621,m373,WILL,Really?
192071,L249664,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
192072,L249663,u5621,m373,WILL,Fuck do you want?
192073,L249662,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T."
192074,L249560,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
192075,L249559,u5621,m373,WILL,Hey fuck you.
192076,L249558,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here."
192077,L249557,u5621,m373,WILL,I'm sorry.
192078,L249556,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,What're you doing?
192079,L249555,u5621,m373,WILL,"Oh, I'm sorry."
192080,L249494,u5617,m373,STUDENT,Who proved the theorem.
192081,L249493,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Find out what?
192082,L249492,u5617,m373,STUDENT,I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
192083,L249491,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,It's Saturday.
192084,L249490,u5617,m373,STUDENT,I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
192085,L249489,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Yes.
192086,L249488,u5617,m373,STUDENT,"Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?"
192087,L250119,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,I did.
192088,L250118,u5619,m373,TIMMY,So who won the bet?
192089,L250117,u5619,m373,TIMMY,"No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy."
192090,L250116,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
192091,L250115,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,You've heard of Albert Einstein?
192092,L250114,u5619,m373,TIMMY,"Yeah, cured polio."
192093,L250113,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
192094,L250112,u5619,m373,TIMMY,Uh-oh.
192095,L250111,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet."
192096,L250091,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Pleasure to meet you.
192097,L250090,u5619,m373,TIMMY,Good to meet you.
192098,L250504,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,About thirty million to one.
192099,L250503,u5615,m373,SEAN,You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
192100,L250502,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,About thirty million to one.
192101,L250501,u5615,m373,SEAN,I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
192102,L250500,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?"
192103,L250499,u5615,m373,SEAN,Sounds good.
192104,L250498,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,How about one now?
192105,L250495,u5615,m373,SEAN,You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
192106,L250494,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,I got one of those too.
192107,L250493,u5615,m373,SEAN,I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
192108,L250492,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Do you know when you'll be back?
192109,L250491,u5615,m373,SEAN,Never been.
192110,L250490,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Why there?
192111,L250489,u5615,m373,SEAN,I don't know. India maybe.
192112,L250488,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Where're you going?
192113,L250487,u5615,m373,SEAN,Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
192114,L250486,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,So I hear you're taking some time.
192115,L250485,u5615,m373,SEAN,Me too.
192116,L250484,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Sean...
192117,L250483,u5615,m373,SEAN,Come in.
192118,L250482,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Hello, Sean."
192119,L250388,u5615,m373,SEAN,He's not you!
192120,L250387,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!"
192121,L250386,u5615,m373,SEAN,"If you push him into something, if you ride him--"
192122,L250385,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,He won't be a failure!
192123,L250384,u5615,m373,SEAN,I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
192124,L250383,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
192125,L250382,u5615,m373,SEAN,--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
192126,L250381,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--"
192127,L250380,u5615,m373,SEAN,"That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!"
192128,L250379,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure."
192129,L250378,u5615,m373,SEAN,--I don't have any anger at you--
192130,L250377,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had."
192131,L250376,u5615,m373,SEAN,--I'm not angry at you--
192132,L250375,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--"
192133,L250374,u5615,m373,SEAN,"--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!"
192134,L250373,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Oh, that's nice--"
192135,L250372,u5615,m373,SEAN,--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
192136,L250371,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Oh, come on, Sean--"
192137,L250370,u5615,m373,SEAN,Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
192138,L250369,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you."
192139,L250368,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Why do you think he does that, Gerry?"
192140,L250367,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--"
192141,L250366,u5615,m373,SEAN,He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
192142,L250365,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
192143,L250364,u5615,m373,SEAN,"""Undermine?"""
192144,L250363,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here."
192145,L250362,u5615,m373,SEAN,I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
192146,L250361,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
192147,L250360,u5615,m373,SEAN,Hold on!
192148,L250359,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
192149,L250358,u5615,m373,SEAN,--Gerry--
192150,L250357,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,--And confuse him--
192151,L250356,u5615,m373,SEAN,Now wait a minute--
192152,L250355,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--"
192153,L250136,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you."
192154,L250135,u5615,m373,SEAN,Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
192155,L250134,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine."
192156,L250133,u5615,m373,SEAN,--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
192157,L250132,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--"
192158,L250131,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Now wait a minute, Gerry--"
192159,L250130,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--"
192160,L250129,u5615,m373,SEAN,Maybe he doesn't care about that.
192161,L250128,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal."
192162,L250127,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Just...take it easy, Gerry."
192163,L250126,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Well, you're the only one."
192164,L250125,u5615,m373,SEAN,I do.
192165,L250124,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--"
192166,L250123,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--"
192167,L250122,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Who?
192168,L250121,u5615,m373,SEAN,He married his cousin.
192169,L250110,u5615,m373,SEAN,What don't I understand?
192170,L250109,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Sean, I really don't think you understand--"
192171,L250108,u5615,m373,SEAN,"That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that."
192172,L250107,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
192173,L250106,u5615,m373,SEAN,Jobs doing what?
192174,L250105,u5615,m373,SEAN,We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
192175,L250104,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?"
192176,L250103,u5615,m373,SEAN,I think so.
192177,L250102,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Seems like it's going well.
192178,L250101,u5615,m373,SEAN,I been here a couple years.
192179,L250100,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,You moved?
192180,L250099,u5615,m373,SEAN,I live right around the corner.
192181,L250098,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"You're here quite a bit, then."
192182,L250089,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together."
192183,L250088,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Not at all.
192184,L250087,u5615,m373,SEAN,Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
192185,L249934,u5615,m373,SEAN,I won't talk first.
192186,L249933,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the ""old neighborhood?"""
192187,L249932,u5615,m373,SEAN,To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
192188,L249931,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Why would he do that?
192189,L249930,u5615,m373,SEAN,"No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually."
192190,L249929,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"What do you mean ""he didn't talk?"" You sat there for an hour?"
192191,L249834,u5615,m373,SEAN,"You too, Gerry."
192192,L249833,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Tom.
192193,L249832,u5615,m373,SEAN,Would you excuse us?
192194,L249828,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
192195,L249827,u5615,m373,SEAN,I'll be okay.
192196,L249826,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit."
192197,L249824,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,It's on the college.
192198,L249823,u5615,m373,SEAN,I got it.
192199,L249822,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,That would be fine.
192200,L249821,u5615,m373,SEAN,Can we do it at my office?
192201,L249820,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Just meet with the boy once a week.
192202,L249819,u5615,m373,SEAN,Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
192203,L249817,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Five.
192204,L249816,u5615,m373,SEAN,He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
192205,L249815,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
192206,L249814,u5615,m373,SEAN,My kind of background?
192207,L249813,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,I need someone with your kind of background.
192208,L249812,u5615,m373,SEAN,Why me?
192209,L249811,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him."
192210,L249810,u5615,m373,SEAN,Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
192211,L249809,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England."
192212,L249808,u5615,m373,SEAN,And he mailed it to Hardy--
192213,L249807,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers..."
192214,L249806,u5615,m373,SEAN,Yeah.
192215,L249805,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?"
192216,L249804,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him."
192217,L249803,u5615,m373,SEAN,"I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule."
192218,L249784,u5615,m373,SEAN,I got your card.
192219,L249783,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"I'm sorry, that damn conference--"
192220,L249782,u5615,m373,SEAN,Since Nancy died.
192221,L249781,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
192222,L249780,u5615,m373,SEAN,I've been busy.
192223,L249779,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,I didn't see you at the reunion.
192224,L249765,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Is there someplace we can talk?
192225,L249764,u5615,m373,SEAN,Good to see you.
192226,L249763,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Good to see you.
192227,L249762,u5615,m373,SEAN,The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
192228,L249761,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Hello.
192229,L249760,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986."
192230,L249759,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,Sean.
192231,L250329,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,"The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together."
192232,L250328,u5620,m373,TOM,What should I do?
192233,L249756,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,He was my roommate in college.
192234,L249755,u5620,m373,TOM,Who is he?
192235,L249754,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,There is somebody...
192236,L249753,u5620,m373,TOM,What do you want to do?
192237,L249752,u5611,m373,LAMBEAU,What's the point?
192238,L249751,u5620,m373,TOM,"I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability."
192239,L250450,u5621,m373,WILL,"So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?"
192240,L250449,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Had one, now I'm fucked again."
192241,L250448,u5621,m373,WILL,"So, you finally got a job Morgan?"
192242,L250042,u5621,m373,WILL,"Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'."
192243,L250041,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?"
192244,L249625,u5621,m373,WILL,Hold up.
192245,L249624,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' ""skiin' trip."" We should'a kicked that dude's ass."
192246,L249563,u5612,m373,MORGAN,How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
192247,L249562,u5621,m373,WILL,"Yeah, Morgan. I got fired."
192248,L249561,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"What happened?  You got fired, huh?"
192249,L249535,u5612,m373,MORGAN,I don't got a crush on her.
192250,L249534,u5621,m373,WILL,"Well, she out did herself today..."
192251,L249507,u5612,m373,MORGAN,"Let's hit ""Kelly's."""
192252,L249506,u5621,m373,WILL,I could go for a Whopper.
192253,L249463,u5612,m373,MORGAN,You guys are fuckin' sick.
192254,L249462,u5621,m373,WILL,It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
192255,L249706,u5621,m373,WILL,"You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free."
192256,L249705,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,"Well, I can see this is pointless..."
192257,L249704,u5621,m373,WILL,"If you wanna hit ""Ramrod,"" take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like ""Inspector Cluseau."""
192258,L249703,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,"Who is ""Danny Terrio?"""
192259,L249702,u5621,m373,WILL,"Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that."
192260,L249701,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,"You're getting defensive, Will."
192261,L249700,u5621,m373,WILL,"I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller."
192262,L249699,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,"Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children."
192263,L249698,u5621,m373,WILL,"Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump."
192264,L249697,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,That's very presumptuous.
192265,L249696,u5621,m373,WILL,"C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true."
192266,L249695,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,What?
192267,L249694,u5621,m373,WILL,Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
192268,L249693,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,I might understand that.
192269,L249692,u5621,m373,WILL,"Certain, clubs.  Like, Paradise. It's not bad."
192270,L249691,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,What places?
192271,L249690,u5621,m373,WILL,"I go places, I interact."
192272,L249689,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,"Like what, Will?"
192273,L249688,u5621,m373,WILL,"No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about."
192274,L249687,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,"Will, your not getting off that easy."
192275,L249686,u5621,m373,WILL,You're right. I know.
192276,L249685,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,"Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will."
192277,L249684,u5621,m373,WILL,"Yeah, I read your book. ""Mike"" had the same problems as ""Chad"" the stockbroker."
192278,L249683,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,"--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for ""Mike"" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book."
192279,L249682,u5621,m373,WILL,"I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--"
192280,L249681,u5614,m373,PSYCHOLOGIST,"Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift."
192281,L249680,u5621,m373,WILL,That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
192282,L250468,u5615,m373,SEAN,Good luck.
192283,L250467,u5621,m373,WILL,See ya.
192284,L250466,u5615,m373,SEAN,Only if you grab my ass.
192285,L250465,u5621,m373,WILL,Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
192286,L250464,u5615,m373,SEAN,No. Thank you.
192287,L250462,u5615,m373,SEAN,"I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be."
192288,L250461,u5621,m373,WILL,I'll keep in touch.
192289,L250460,u5615,m373,SEAN,"You're Welcome, Will."
192290,L250459,u5621,m373,WILL,"I just want you to know, Sean..."
192291,L250458,u5615,m373,SEAN,We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
192292,L250457,u5621,m373,WILL,"Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?"
192293,L250456,u5615,m373,SEAN,Good for you. Congratulations.
192294,L250455,u5621,m373,WILL,"Yeah, I think so."
192295,L250454,u5615,m373,SEAN,That's what you want?
192296,L250453,u5621,m373,WILL,"Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy."
192297,L250452,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Which one did you take, Will?"
192298,L250422,u5621,m373,WILL,"I know, I know..."
192299,L250421,u5615,m373,SEAN,It's not...
192300,L250420,u5621,m373,WILL,I know.
192301,L250419,u5615,m373,SEAN,It's not your fault.
192302,L250418,u5621,m373,WILL,Don't fuck with me.
192303,L250417,u5615,m373,SEAN,It's not your fault.
192304,L250416,u5621,m373,WILL,I know.
192305,L250415,u5615,m373,SEAN,It's not your fault.
192306,L250414,u5621,m373,WILL,I know.
192307,L250413,u5615,m373,SEAN,It's not your fault.
192308,L250412,u5621,m373,WILL,I know.
192309,L250411,u5615,m373,SEAN,It's not your fault.
192310,L250410,u5621,m373,WILL,"Oh, I know."
192311,L250408,u5621,m373,WILL,"Cause fuck him, that's why."
192312,L250407,u5615,m373,SEAN,"The wrench, why?"
192313,L250406,u5621,m373,WILL,I used to go with the wrench.
192314,L250405,u5615,m373,SEAN,Gotta go with the belt there...
192315,L250401,u5621,m373,WILL,It sure ain't good.
192316,L250400,u5615,m373,SEAN,Yes.
192317,L250399,u5621,m373,WILL,"--No, have you had any experience with that?"
192318,L250398,u5615,m373,SEAN,Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
192319,L250397,u5621,m373,WILL,No.  Have you had any experience with that?
192320,L250396,u5615,m373,SEAN,You want to read it?
192321,L250395,u5621,m373,WILL,You're not going to fail me are you?
192322,L250394,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation."
192323,L250393,u5621,m373,WILL,Do you want to talk about it?
192324,L250392,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you."
192325,L250391,u5621,m373,WILL,"Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy."
192326,L250326,u5615,m373,SEAN,Look at me. What do you want to do?
192327,L250325,u5621,m373,WILL,That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
192328,L250324,u5615,m373,SEAN,I been there. I played my hand.
192329,L250323,u5621,m373,WILL,What?
192330,L250322,u5615,m373,SEAN,"If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time."
192331,L250321,u5621,m373,WILL,What?
192332,L250320,u5615,m373,SEAN,"You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man."
192333,L250319,u5621,m373,WILL,"Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that."
192334,L250318,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out."
192335,L250317,u5621,m373,WILL,I didn't ask for this.
192336,L250316,u5615,m373,SEAN,"It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?"
192337,L250315,u5621,m373,WILL,I didn't want the job.
192338,L250314,u5615,m373,SEAN,Don't give me you line of shit.
192339,L250313,u5621,m373,WILL,"Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?"
192340,L250312,u5615,m373,SEAN,"That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road."
192341,L250311,u5621,m373,WILL,"Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no..."
192342,L250310,u5615,m373,SEAN,"But you can't give back to them, Will."
192343,L250309,u5621,m373,WILL,"Not to me, they're not."
192344,L250308,u5615,m373,SEAN,They're all dead.
192345,L250307,u5621,m373,WILL,Yeah.
192346,L250306,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate."
192347,L250305,u5621,m373,WILL,Define that.
192348,L250304,u5615,m373,SEAN,Do you have a soul-mate?
192349,L250303,u5621,m373,WILL,What?
192350,L250302,u5615,m373,SEAN,Do you think you're alone?
192351,L250301,u5621,m373,WILL,What did I think?
192352,L250300,u5615,m373,SEAN,What did you think?
192353,L250299,u5621,m373,WILL,I guess.
192354,L250298,u5615,m373,SEAN,Gerry says the meeting went well.
192355,L250297,u5621,m373,WILL,I don't know.
192356,L250296,u5615,m373,SEAN,So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
192357,L250012,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run."
192358,L250011,u5621,m373,WILL,Would have been nice to catch that game though.
192359,L250010,u5615,m373,SEAN,"No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game."
192360,L250009,u5621,m373,WILL,You're kiddin' me.
192361,L250008,u5615,m373,SEAN,They could see that I meant it.
192362,L250007,u5621,m373,WILL,"""I gotta go see about a girl""? What did they say?"
192363,L250006,u5615,m373,SEAN,"I just slid my ticket across the table and said ""sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."""
192364,L250005,u5621,m373,WILL,I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
192365,L250004,u5615,m373,SEAN,You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
192366,L250003,u5621,m373,WILL,"So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?"
192367,L250002,u5615,m373,SEAN,That's right.
192368,L250001,u5621,m373,WILL,You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
192369,L250000,u5615,m373,SEAN,I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
192370,L249999,u5621,m373,WILL,Where were you?
192371,L249998,u5615,m373,SEAN,"October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them."
192372,L249997,u5621,m373,WILL,When did you know she was the one?
192373,L249996,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her."
192374,L249995,u5621,m373,WILL,You don't regret meetin' your wife?
192375,L249994,u5615,m373,SEAN,What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
192376,L249993,u5621,m373,WILL,Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
192377,L249992,u5615,m373,SEAN,Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
192378,L249991,u5621,m373,WILL,What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
192379,L249990,u5615,m373,SEAN,Yeah.
192380,L249989,u5621,m373,WILL,"Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?"
192381,L249988,u5615,m373,SEAN,"I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one."
192382,L249987,u5621,m373,WILL,Is that why you didn't write anything else?
192383,L249986,u5615,m373,SEAN,I gave that up when my wife got sick.
192384,L249985,u5621,m373,WILL,Why not?
192385,L249984,u5615,m373,SEAN,"No, I don't."
192386,L249983,u5615,m373,SEAN,Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
192387,L249967,u5621,m373,WILL,"Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone."
192388,L249966,u5615,m373,SEAN,My wife's dead.
192389,L249965,u5621,m373,WILL,"Hence, the word remarried."
192390,L249964,u5615,m373,SEAN,My wife's dead.
192391,L249963,u5621,m373,WILL,You ever think about gettin' remarried?
192392,L249962,u5615,m373,SEAN,"I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it."
192393,L249960,u5615,m373,SEAN,And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
192394,L249959,u5621,m373,WILL,"Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that."
192395,L249958,u5615,m373,SEAN,"So Christ, call her up."
192396,L249957,u5621,m373,WILL,"I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun..."
192397,L249956,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Jesus Christ, you are an amateur."
192398,L249955,u5621,m373,WILL,Haven't called her.
192399,L249954,u5615,m373,SEAN,Why not?
192400,L249953,u5621,m373,WILL,I don't know.
192401,L249952,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Well, are you going out again?"
192402,L249951,u5621,m373,WILL,Fine.
192403,L249950,u5615,m373,SEAN,How'd it go?
192404,L249949,u5621,m373,WILL,"Yeah, I went on a date last week."
192405,L249948,u5615,m373,SEAN,Yeah? You got a lady now?
192406,L249947,u5621,m373,WILL,"I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person."
192407,L249946,u5615,m373,SEAN,You've never been on a plane.
192408,L249945,u5621,m373,WILL,"You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like ""we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet,"" and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says ""man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee."" So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes ""don't forget the coffee!"""
192409,L249918,u5615,m373,SEAN,"So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term ""visiting hours"" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?"
192410,L249917,u5621,m373,WILL,No.
192411,L249916,u5615,m373,SEAN,You've never been out of Boston.
192412,L249915,u5621,m373,WILL,Why thank you.
192413,L249914,u5615,m373,SEAN,You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
192414,L249913,u5621,m373,WILL,No.
192415,L249912,u5615,m373,SEAN,"I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?"
192416,L249911,u5621,m373,WILL,So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
192417,L249877,u5621,m373,WILL,Time's up.
192418,L249876,u5615,m373,SEAN,If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
192419,L249875,u5621,m373,WILL,That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
192420,L249874,u5615,m373,SEAN,Watch your mouth.
192421,L249873,u5621,m373,WILL,Maybe you married the wrong woman.
192422,L249872,u5615,m373,SEAN,Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
192423,L249871,u5615,m373,SEAN,Maybe what mea--
192424,L249870,u5621,m373,WILL,"--Well, maybe that means you."
192425,L249869,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Sure, how 'bout ""still waters run deep""--"
192426,L249868,u5621,m373,WILL,"You ever heard the saying, ""any port in a storm?"""
192427,L249867,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Oh, ""Starry Night"" time, huh?"
192428,L249866,u5621,m373,WILL,I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
192429,L249865,u5615,m373,SEAN,What is?
192430,L249864,u5621,m373,WILL,"The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting."
192431,L249863,u5615,m373,SEAN,What does?
192432,L249862,u5621,m373,WILL,"Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me."
192433,L249861,u5615,m373,SEAN,Tell me what you really think.
192434,L249860,u5621,m373,WILL,This is a real piece of shit.
192435,L249859,u5615,m373,SEAN,Crayons?
192436,L249858,u5621,m373,WILL,No.
192437,L249857,u5615,m373,SEAN,Yeah. Do you paint?
192438,L249856,u5621,m373,WILL,Oh.
192439,L249855,u5615,m373,SEAN,285.
192440,L249854,u5615,m373,SEAN,Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
192441,L249853,u5621,m373,WILL,Nautilus?
192442,L249852,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Yes, I do."
192443,L249851,u5621,m373,WILL,You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
192444,L249850,u5615,m373,SEAN,Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
192445,L249849,u5621,m373,WILL,Whatever blows your hair back.
192446,L249848,u5615,m373,SEAN,You think so?
192447,L249847,u5621,m373,WILL,"You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books."
192448,L249846,u5615,m373,SEAN,"How about Noam Chomsky's ""Manufacturing Consent?"""
192449,L249845,u5621,m373,WILL,"""A History of the United States, Volume I."" If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's ""A People's History of the United States."" That book will knock you on your ass."
192450,L249844,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Yeah, it did take me a long time."
192451,L249843,u5621,m373,WILL,That must have taken you a long time.
192452,L249842,u5615,m373,SEAN,I did.
192453,L249841,u5621,m373,WILL,"I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?"
192454,L249840,u5615,m373,SEAN,What did you think?
192455,L249839,u5621,m373,WILL,"Yeah, I read those."
192456,L249838,u5615,m373,SEAN,How about the ones on that shelf?
192457,L249837,u5621,m373,WILL,Probably not.
192458,L249836,u5615,m373,SEAN,"Have you read all these books, Will?"
192459,L249835,u5621,m373,WILL,"Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a ""shrink kit"" that comes with all these volumes included?"
192460,L250288,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Goodbye.
192461,L250287,u5621,m373,WILL,Take care.
192462,L250286,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"I love you, Will.  No take-backs."
192463,L250285,u5621,m373,WILL,Yeah.
192464,L250284,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,I never cared about that.
192465,L250283,u5621,m373,WILL,I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
192466,L250270,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life."
192467,L250269,u5621,m373,WILL,Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
192468,L250268,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"I don't want to ""save"" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!"
192469,L250267,u5621,m373,WILL,"What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says ""save me"" on my back?"
192470,L250266,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?"
192471,L250265,u5621,m373,WILL,You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
192472,L250264,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Yes, I do, Will."
192473,L250263,u5621,m373,WILL,"No, you don't want to hear that."
192474,L250262,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?"
192475,L250261,u5621,m373,WILL,"Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?"
192476,L250260,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,What about your twelve brothers?
192477,L250259,u5621,m373,WILL,I'm not honest?
192478,L250258,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
192479,L250257,u5621,m373,WILL,What the fuck am I afraid of?!
192480,L250256,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
192481,L250255,u5621,m373,WILL,At least you have a mother.
192482,L250254,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died."
192483,L250253,u5621,m373,WILL,--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
192484,L250252,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Is that what you think--
192485,L250251,u5621,m373,WILL,--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
192486,L250250,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--"
192487,L250249,u5621,m373,WILL,What am I scared of?
192488,L250248,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
192489,L250247,u5621,m373,WILL,"What do you mean ""What am I afraid of?"""
192490,L250246,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Then what are you afraid of?
192491,L250245,u5621,m373,WILL,I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
192492,L250244,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that."
192493,L250243,u5621,m373,WILL,"One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--"
192494,L250242,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Why not?
192495,L250241,u5621,m373,WILL,I can't go out to California.
192496,L250240,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"""Take-back?"" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me."
192497,L250239,u5621,m373,WILL,"'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like ""hey this is a big mistake.""  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back."
192498,L250238,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Yeah, I'm sure."
192499,L250237,u5621,m373,WILL,And you're sure about that?
192500,L250236,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,I don't know. I just feel it.
192501,L250235,u5621,m373,WILL,"Yeah, but how do you know?"
192502,L250234,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,I know. I just do.
192503,L250233,u5621,m373,WILL,How do you know that?
192504,L250232,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,I want you to come with me.
192505,L250231,u5621,m373,WILL,What?
192506,L250230,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Come with me to California.
192507,L250229,u5621,m373,WILL,No.
192508,L250228,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Will? Are you awake?
192509,L250180,u5621,m373,WILL,--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
192510,L250179,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--"
192511,L250178,u5621,m373,WILL,"Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--"
192512,L250177,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"So, do you play the piano?"
192513,L250176,u5621,m373,WILL,"Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head."
192514,L250175,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"I see ""Hot Cross Buns,"" but okay."
192515,L250174,u5621,m373,WILL,"I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart."
192516,L250173,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Come one Will. I just want to know.
192517,L250172,u5621,m373,WILL,Do you play the piano?
192518,L250171,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars."
192519,L250170,u5621,m373,WILL,Like me?
192520,L250169,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Nobody does organic chemistry for ""fun."" It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you."
192521,L250168,u5621,m373,WILL,I guess so.
192522,L250167,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Just for fun?
192523,L250166,u5621,m373,WILL,"Some, a little."
192524,L250165,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
192525,L250164,u5621,m373,WILL,I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
192526,L250163,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?"
192527,L250162,u5621,m373,WILL,"Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor."
192528,L250161,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially."
192529,L250160,u5621,m373,WILL,You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
192530,L250159,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Clearly.
192531,L250158,u5621,m373,WILL,"Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing."
192532,L250157,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,It's important that I learn this.
192533,L250156,u5621,m373,WILL,"C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages."
192534,L250155,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,No.
192535,L250154,u5621,m373,WILL,Want me to take a look?
192536,L250153,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Fine.
192537,L250152,u5621,m373,WILL,How's it goin'?
192538,L250070,u5621,m373,WILL,Not tonight.
192539,L250069,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,I thought you said you'd show me your place.
192540,L250040,u5621,m373,WILL,"Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance."
192541,L250039,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
192542,L250038,u5621,m373,WILL,"I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up."
192543,L250037,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
192544,L250036,u5621,m373,WILL,Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
192545,L250035,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,When?
192546,L250034,u5621,m373,WILL,"All right, all right. We'll go."
192547,L250033,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
192548,L250032,u5621,m373,WILL,"Aah, it's kind of a hike."
192549,L250031,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,I think I can make it to South Boston.
192550,L250030,u5621,m373,WILL,They don't come over here that much.
192551,L250029,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
192552,L250028,u5621,m373,WILL,Exactly.
192553,L250027,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,I've never seen your place.
192554,L250026,u5621,m373,WILL,'Cause it's nicer than my place.
192555,L250025,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Why do we always stay here?
192556,L249982,u5621,m373,WILL,Then let's go have some fun.
192557,L249981,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,No.
192558,L249980,u5621,m373,WILL,You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
192559,L249979,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,I'm supposed to understand this.
192560,L249978,u5621,m373,WILL,Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
192561,L249977,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,How the hell did you do that?
192562,L249976,u5621,m373,WILL,I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
192563,L249975,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,If you bring the caramels.
192564,L249974,u5621,m373,WILL,Promise?
192565,L249973,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"You should have called. I have an ""O- chem"" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:"
192566,L249972,u5621,m373,WILL,Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
192567,L249971,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me."

192578,L249900,u5621,m373,WILL,"It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice."

192601,L249796,u5621,m373,WILL,No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
192602,L249795,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Oh, you will?"

192608,L249789,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
192609,L249788,u5621,m373,WILL,I really don't 'date' that much.
192610,L249787,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing."
192611,L249786,u5621,m373,WILL,No.
192612,L249785,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Have you ever seen Annie Hall?

192618,L249772,u5621,m373,WILL,So you just want to use me and go?
192619,L249771,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.

192623,L249767,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that..."
192624,L249661,u5621,m373,WILL,"You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?"
192625,L249660,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Sounds good, where are you now?"

192627,L249658,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
192628,L249657,u5621,m373,WILL,"Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night."
192629,L249656,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description."
192630,L249655,u5621,m373,WILL,"It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?"
192631,L249654,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Yeah?
192632,L249622,u5621,m373,WILL,The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
192633,L249621,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line."
192634,L249620,u5621,m373,WILL,I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.

192638,L249616,u5621,m373,WILL,"When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee."
192639,L249615,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,What?
192640,L249614,u5621,m373,WILL,"Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels."
192641,L249613,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Here's my number.
192642,L249612,u5621,m373,WILL,"I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe..."
192643,L249611,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,"Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education."
192644,L249610,u5621,m373,WILL,I kind of got that impression.
192645,L249609,u5616,m373,SKYLAR,Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.

192773,L255066,u5627,m374,CARETAKER,"They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights."
192774,L255065,u5652,m374,TOM,"I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas."
192775,L255064,u5627,m374,CARETAKER,No cop can come in here without a warrant.
192776,L255063,u5652,m374,TOM,An' you say no cops?
192777,L255062,u5627,m374,CARETAKER,That's the way it is.
192778,L255061,u5652,m374,TOM,Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
192779,L255060,u5627,m374,CARETAKER,"We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes."
192780,L255059,u5652,m374,TOM,We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
192781,L255058,u5627,m374,CARETAKER,"Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that."
192782,L255053,u5627,m374,CARETAKER,How many of you?

192785,L254959,u5652,m374,TOM,"I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here."
192786,L254958,u5628,m374,CASY,"Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?"
192787,L254949,u5628,m374,CASY,"Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*."
192788,L254948,u5652,m374,TOM,"We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?"
192789,L254947,u5628,m374,CASY,I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
192790,L254944,u5628,m374,CASY,But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
192791,L254943,u5652,m374,TOM,They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
192792,L254942,u5628,m374,CASY,"Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!"
192793,L254941,u5652,m374,TOM,I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
192794,L254939,u5628,m374,CASY,"Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out."
192795,L254938,u5652,m374,TOM,I aim to.
192796,L254937,u5628,m374,CASY,I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
192797,L254936,u5652,m374,TOM,I dunno. Payin' five now.
192798,L254935,u5628,m374,CASY,"Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?"
192799,L254927,u5628,m374,CASY,"No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in."
192800,L254926,u5652,m374,TOM,Thought you was in jail.
192801,L254925,u5628,m374,CASY,"Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?"
192802,L254924,u5652,m374,TOM,Casy! What you doin' here?
192803,L254923,u5628,m374,CASY,What's the matter?
192804,L254774,u5628,m374,CASY,Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
192805,L254773,u5652,m374,TOM,You're right!
192806,L254772,u5628,m374,CASY,"He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?"
192807,L254771,u5652,m374,TOM,I ain't gonna run.
192808,L254770,u5628,m374,CASY,Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
192809,L254551,u5628,m374,CASY,I don't know.
192810,L254550,u5652,m374,TOM,How about us? Is that the truth for us?
192811,L254489,u5628,m374,CASY,"I'll say 'em--an' make it short.  This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, ""All that lives is holy."" But I wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. If I was to pray I'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. He's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it."
192812,L254488,u5652,m374,TOM,We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
192813,L254487,u5628,m374,CASY,"I ain't no more a preacher, you know."
192814,L254435,u5628,m374,CASY,If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
192815,L254434,u5652,m374,TOM,Think she'll hold?
192816,L254356,u5652,m374,TOM,"It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know."
192817,L254355,u5628,m374,CASY,What you figger to do?
192818,L254354,u5652,m374,TOM,She's settlin'.
192819,L254298,u5652,m374,TOM,"All right, you remember the *man* then."
192820,L254297,u5628,m374,CASY,I ain't no preacher anymore.
192821,L254296,u5652,m374,TOM,"This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?"
192822,L254291,u5628,m374,CASY,I never heard nothin' about it.
192823,L254290,u5652,m374,TOM,This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
192824,L254288,u5652,m374,TOM,No. They wasn't people to write.
192825,L254287,u5628,m374,CASY,They never wrote you nothing?
192826,L254286,u5652,m374,TOM,They're all gone--or dead.
192827,L254281,u5652,m374,TOM,That's our place.
192828,L254280,u5628,m374,CASY,"Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist."
192829,L254279,u5652,m374,TOM,Just around that next bend.
192830,L254278,u5628,m374,CASY,Is it fur?
192831,L254277,u5628,m374,CASY,"Shore it is. It always is, this time a year."

192833,L254275,u5628,m374,CASY,"I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that."
192834,L254274,u5652,m374,TOM,Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
192835,L254273,u5628,m374,CASY,It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
192836,L254272,u5652,m374,TOM,"No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?"
192837,L254271,u5628,m374,CASY,Ain't you seen your folks since then?
192838,L254270,u5652,m374,TOM,He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
192839,L254269,u5628,m374,CASY,And you ain't ashamed?
192840,L254268,u5652,m374,TOM,I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
192841,L254267,u5628,m374,CASY,Excuse me for asking.
192842,L254266,u5652,m374,TOM,I been in the penitentiary for four years.
192843,L254265,u5628,m374,CASY,"No, I never. What?"
192844,L254264,u5652,m374,TOM,Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
192845,L254263,u5628,m374,CASY,Been out travelin' around?
192846,L254262,u5652,m374,TOM,Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
192847,L254261,u5628,m374,CASY,Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
192848,L254260,u5652,m374,TOM,Have a little snort?
192849,L254259,u5628,m374,CASY,"But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say."
192850,L254258,u5652,m374,TOM,I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
192851,L254257,u5628,m374,CASY,"At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me."
192852,L254256,u5652,m374,TOM,Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
192853,L254255,u5628,m374,CASY,I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
192854,L254254,u5652,m374,TOM,Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
192855,L254253,u5628,m374,CASY,"*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit."
192856,L254252,u5652,m374,TOM,"Why, you're the preacher!"
192857,L254251,u5628,m374,CASY,"Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son."
192858,L254250,u5652,m374,TOM,Yeah. On my way home now.
192859,L254249,u5628,m374,CASY,"Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?"

192863,L254672,u5645,m374,ROSASHARN,"You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?"

192866,L254866,u5630,m374,COP,"Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line."
192867,L254865,u5652,m374,TOM,What's the matter? What's happened?
192868,L254864,u5630,m374,COP,Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.

192876,L254343,u5631,m374,DAVIS,"You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place."
192877,L254342,u5643,m374,MULEY,"Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come."
192878,L254339,u5631,m374,DAVIS,*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
192879,L254338,u5643,m374,MULEY,"But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?"
192880,L254337,u5631,m374,DAVIS,"For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout."
192881,L254336,u5643,m374,MULEY,Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
192882,L254335,u5631,m374,DAVIS,I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
192883,L254246,u5652,m374,TOM,"Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you."

192989,L254521,u5640,m374,MA,"No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together."
192990,L254520,u5645,m374,ROSASHARN,Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
192991,L254519,u5640,m374,MA,Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
192992,L254518,u5645,m374,ROSASHARN,"You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?"
192993,L254517,u5640,m374,MA,They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
192994,L254516,u5645,m374,ROSASHARN,But will it--hurt the baby?
192995,L254515,u5640,m374,MA,"Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow."
192996,L254514,u5645,m374,ROSASHARN,Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.
192997,L254513,u5640,m374,MA,Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
192998,L254512,u5645,m374,ROSASHARN,"Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?"
192999,L255237,u5640,m374,MA,"I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people."
193000,L255236,u5644,m374,PA,"Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'."
193001,L255222,u5640,m374,MA,She'll be awright.
193002,L255221,u5644,m374,PA,"Make her easy, John. Watch her."
193003,L255022,u5640,m374,MA,"Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here."
193004,L255021,u5644,m374,PA,Know where we're a-goin'?
193005,L254900,u5640,m374,MA,They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
193006,L254899,u5644,m374,PA,That!
193007,L254845,u5644,m374,PA,It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
193008,L254844,u5640,m374,MA,"Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon."
193009,L254821,u5644,m374,PA,"How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?"
193010,L254820,u5640,m374,MA,Pa! Shh!
193011,L254819,u5644,m374,PA,Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
193012,L254818,u5640,m374,MA,Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
193013,L254807,u5640,m374,MA,"Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!"
193014,L254806,u5644,m374,PA,"Jus' sassy, that's all."
193015,L254803,u5644,m374,PA,"I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!"
193016,L254802,u5640,m374,MA,"Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on."
193017,L254801,u5644,m374,PA,"Now don't get sassy, Ma."
193018,L254800,u5640,m374,MA,"You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it."
193019,L254799,u5644,m374,PA,"Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--"
193020,L254798,u5640,m374,MA,"You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!"
193021,L254735,u5640,m374,MA,Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
193022,L254734,u5644,m374,PA,How 'bout it?
193023,L255213,u5640,m374,MA,"Good-by, Tommy."
193024,L255212,u5652,m374,TOM,Sure. Good-by.
193025,L255211,u5640,m374,MA,"Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?"
193026,L255210,u5652,m374,TOM,"Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by."
193027,L255209,u5640,m374,MA,"I don't understan' it, Tom."
193028,L255208,u5652,m374,TOM,"Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too."
193029,L255207,u5640,m374,MA,"Then what, Tom?"
193030,L255206,u5652,m374,TOM,"Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then..."
193031,L255205,u5640,m374,MA,How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
193032,L255204,u5652,m374,TOM,"No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough."
193033,L255203,u5640,m374,MA,"You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!"
193034,L255202,u5652,m374,TOM,"They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then..."
193035,L255201,u5640,m374,MA,"Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy."
193036,L255200,u5652,m374,TOM,"I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--"
193037,L255199,u5640,m374,MA,He was a good man.
193038,L255198,u5652,m374,TOM,"You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it."
193039,L255197,u5640,m374,MA,"Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?"
193040,L255196,u5652,m374,TOM,"I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too."
193041,L255195,u5640,m374,MA,"I could hide you, Tommy."
193042,L255194,u5652,m374,TOM,I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
193043,L255193,u5640,m374,MA,"It had to come, I reckon, soon or later."
193044,L255192,u5652,m374,TOM,"They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n."
193045,L255170,u5640,m374,MA,Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
193046,L255169,u5652,m374,TOM,"She's gettin' prettier, Ma."
193047,L255036,u5652,m374,TOM,Don't know--but it's better'n this.
193048,L255035,u5640,m374,MA,What is it?
193049,L255003,u5652,m374,TOM,I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
193050,L255002,u5640,m374,MA,It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
193051,L255001,u5640,m374,MA,Comes night we'll get outa here.
193052,L255000,u5652,m374,TOM,"That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too."
193053,L254988,u5652,m374,TOM,"Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay."
193054,L254987,u5640,m374,MA,"Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me."
193055,L254986,u5652,m374,TOM,I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
193056,L254985,u5640,m374,MA,"It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you."
193057,L254984,u5652,m374,TOM,"I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it."
193058,L254983,u5640,m374,MA,They know he got hit in the face.
193059,L254982,u5652,m374,TOM,They know what--this fella looks like?
193060,L254981,u5640,m374,MA,That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
193061,L254980,u5652,m374,TOM,They killed Casy first.
193062,L254979,u5640,m374,MA,Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
193063,L254978,u5652,m374,TOM,I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
193064,L254977,u5640,m374,MA,Looks like you done it.
193065,L254976,u5652,m374,TOM,Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
193066,L254975,u5640,m374,MA,"How's it feel, Tommy?"
193067,L254911,u5652,m374,TOM,"Okay, Ma. Don't you worry."
193068,L254910,u5640,m374,MA,"You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything."
193069,L254902,u5640,m374,MA,"Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty."
193070,L254901,u5652,m374,TOM,I ain't full.
193071,L254898,u5640,m374,MA,"No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth."
193072,L254897,u5652,m374,TOM,"Got any more, Ma?"
193073,L254857,u5640,m374,MA,"You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!"
193074,L254856,u5652,m374,TOM,"Get some sugar too, for the coffee."
193075,L254855,u5640,m374,MA,"Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk."
193076,L254836,u5652,m374,TOM,What's that--detour?
193077,L254835,u5640,m374,MA,"You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear."
193078,L254834,u5652,m374,TOM,"I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am."
193079,L254833,u5640,m374,MA,"You promised, Tommy."
193080,L254832,u5652,m374,TOM,"I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency."
193081,L254831,u5640,m374,MA,Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
193082,L254830,u5652,m374,TOM,"Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad."
193083,L254722,u5640,m374,MA,On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
193084,L254721,u5652,m374,TOM,She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
193085,L254705,u5640,m374,MA,I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
193086,L254704,u5652,m374,TOM,An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
193087,L254703,u5640,m374,MA,Since before they stopped us las' night.
193088,L254702,u5652,m374,TOM,When?
193089,L254701,u5640,m374,MA,Granma's dead.
193090,L254700,u5652,m374,TOM,Was Granma bad?
193091,L254699,u5640,m374,MA,No.
193092,L254698,u5652,m374,TOM,Didn' you get no sleep?
193093,L254697,u5640,m374,MA,Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us.
193094,L254696,u5652,m374,TOM,"Look, Ma!"
193095,L254695,u5640,m374,MA,Ya say we're acrost?
193096,L254694,u5652,m374,TOM,"Ma, you sick?"
193097,L254498,u5652,m374,TOM,"Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--"
193098,L254497,u5640,m374,MA,Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
193099,L254496,u5652,m374,TOM,"Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean."
193100,L254495,u5640,m374,MA,Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
193101,L254494,u5652,m374,TOM,"Yes'm, that was it."
193102,L254459,u5652,m374,TOM,That's right. And douse some in it.
193103,L254458,u5640,m374,MA,And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
193104,L254457,u5652,m374,TOM,Don't taste bad.
193105,L254456,u5640,m374,MA,Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
193106,L254424,u5640,m374,MA,I'm ready.
193107,L254423,u5652,m374,TOM,"How about it, Ma?"
193108,L254389,u5640,m374,MA,Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son
193109,L254388,u5652,m374,TOM,"No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that."
193110,L254387,u5640,m374,MA,"Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?"
193111,L254386,u5652,m374,TOM,"No, Ma I was at first--but not no more."
193112,L254385,u5640,m374,MA,Sometimes they do.
193113,L254384,u5652,m374,TOM,"Mad, Ma?"
193114,L254383,u5640,m374,MA,"We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?"
193115,L254382,u5652,m374,TOM,"Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?"
193116,L254381,u5652,m374,TOM,"I'd a found you, Ma."
193117,L254380,u5640,m374,MA,I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
193118,L254379,u5652,m374,TOM,"No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers."
193119,L254378,u5640,m374,MA,"Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?"

193127,L254578,u5644,m374,PA,Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
193128,L254577,u5641,m374,MAE,This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
193129,L254572,u5641,m374,MAE,You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
193130,L254571,u5644,m374,PA,"I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip."

193135,L254566,u5641,m374,MAE,Yeah?
193136,L254363,u5643,m374,MULEY,I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
193137,L254362,u5652,m374,TOM,Won't they come out here?
193138,L254361,u5643,m374,MULEY,All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
193139,L254359,u5643,m374,MULEY,You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
193140,L254358,u5652,m374,TOM,Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
193141,L254357,u5643,m374,MULEY,"Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!"
193142,L254348,u5643,m374,MULEY,"The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am."
193143,L254347,u5652,m374,TOM,But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
193144,L254346,u5643,m374,MULEY,What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
193145,L254327,u5643,m374,MULEY,They come. They come and pushed me off.
193146,L254326,u5652,m374,TOM,Well?
193147,L254308,u5652,m374,TOM,"That's what I asked you, ain't it?"
193148,L254307,u5643,m374,MULEY,Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
193149,L254306,u5652,m374,TOM,Are you crazy?
193150,L254305,u5643,m374,MULEY,"Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now."
193151,L254304,u5652,m374,TOM,But who done it?
193152,L254303,u5643,m374,MULEY,"Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off."
193153,L254302,u5652,m374,TOM,But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
193154,L254301,u5643,m374,MULEY,"Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off."
193155,L254295,u5652,m374,TOM,I know that! But *where* they gone?
193156,L254294,u5643,m374,MULEY,They gone.
193157,L254293,u5652,m374,TOM,"Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?"
193158,L254292,u5643,m374,MULEY,Tommy?
193159,L254325,u5643,m374,MULEY,"Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!"
193160,L254324,u5650,m374,THE MAN,"Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!"
193161,L254323,u5643,m374,MULEY,Then who *do* we shoot?
193162,L254318,u5650,m374,THE MAN,It ain't nobody. It's a company.
193163,L254317,u5643,m374,MULEY,Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
193164,L254314,u5650,m374,THE MAN,Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
193165,L254313,u5643,m374,MULEY,You mean get off my own land?
193166,L254312,u5650,m374,THE MAN,"I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you."
193167,L254311,u5643,m374,MULEY,"But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way."
193168,L254310,u5650,m374,THE MAN,"Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop."
193169,L255050,u5652,m374,TOM,You're tootin' we're gonna stay.
193170,L255049,u5644,m374,PA,"We gonna stay, ain't we?"
193171,L255048,u5652,m374,TOM,"Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign."
193172,L254905,u5644,m374,PA,No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
193173,L254904,u5652,m374,TOM,Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
193174,L254903,u5644,m374,PA,You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
193175,L254827,u5652,m374,TOM,Give 'im a fryin' pan.
193176,L254826,u5644,m374,PA,I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
193177,L254825,u5652,m374,TOM,Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
193178,L254637,u5652,m374,TOM,Me an' you both.
193179,L254636,u5644,m374,PA,"Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that."
193180,L254622,u5644,m374,PA,I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
193181,L254621,u5652,m374,TOM,"She's jus' wore out, that's all."
193182,L254618,u5644,m374,PA,How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
193183,L254617,u5652,m374,TOM,Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
193184,L254486,u5652,m374,TOM,"Casy, won't you say a few words?"
193185,L254485,u5644,m374,PA,"Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground."
193186,L254484,u5652,m374,TOM,"I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one."
193187,L254475,u5652,m374,TOM,"California, here we come!"
193188,L254474,u5644,m374,PA,Here we go!
193189,L254455,u5652,m374,TOM,"Ain't no whisky, is they?"
193190,L254454,u5644,m374,PA,Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
193191,L254453,u5652,m374,TOM,"Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here."
193192,L254420,u5652,m374,TOM,"Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?"
193193,L254419,u5644,m374,PA,"Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that."
193194,L254418,u5652,m374,TOM,How you get all this money?
193195,L254405,u5652,m374,TOM,"Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up."
193196,L254404,u5644,m374,PA,That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
193197,L254542,u5648,m374,SECOND MAN,"Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?"
193198,L254541,u5644,m374,PA,But what does *that* prove?
193199,L254538,u5648,m374,SECOND MAN,I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
193200,L254537,u5644,m374,PA,But what about this?
193201,L254536,u5648,m374,SECOND MAN,"Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!"
193202,L254535,u5644,m374,PA,"Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!"
193203,L254532,u5644,m374,PA,We gonna take whatever they got.
193204,L254531,u5648,m374,SECOND MAN,"Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?"
193205,L254824,u5652,m374,TOM,Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry.
193206,L254823,u5645,m374,ROSASHARN,"Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live."

193305,L256731,u5659,m375,CLUB MEMBER #2,Insane.
193306,L256730,u5658,m375,CLUB MEMBER #1,"Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way."
193307,L256729,u5659,m375,CLUB MEMBER #2,"A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane."
193308,L256728,u5658,m375,CLUB MEMBER #1,"That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff."
193309,L256725,u5658,m375,CLUB MEMBER #1,"It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value."
193310,L256724,u5659,m375,CLUB MEMBER #2,He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
193311,L256723,u5658,m375,CLUB MEMBER #1,I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
193312,L256745,u5658,m375,CLUB MEMBER #1,Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
193313,L256744,u5668,m375,MARTIN,And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?

193316,L256741,u5658,m375,CLUB MEMBER #1,"You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week."
193317,L256740,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony."
193318,L257391,u5661,m375,DEBI,Other people can't.
193319,L257390,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that."
193320,L257389,u5661,m375,DEBI,You kill people.
193321,L257345,u5661,m375,DEBI,"That's because I speak human, and you speak monster."
193322,L257344,u5668,m375,MARTIN,You don't understand...
193323,L257343,u5661,m375,DEBI,"You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate."
193324,L257341,u5661,m375,DEBI,I'll hide.
193325,L257340,u5668,m375,MARTIN,What if I come back?
193326,L257339,u5661,m375,DEBI,I'm staying here.
193327,L257338,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Will you come with me?
193328,L257337,u5661,m375,DEBI,That's probably a good idea.
193329,L257336,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I was leaving.
193330,L257335,u5661,m375,DEBI,You never could have kept this from me.
193331,L257334,u5668,m375,MARTIN,A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
193332,L257333,u5661,m375,DEBI,"Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!"
193333,L257332,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things."
193334,L257331,u5661,m375,DEBI,"Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm...."
193335,L257330,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life."
193336,L257329,u5661,m375,DEBI,Jesus Christ!
193337,L257328,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work."
193338,L257327,u5661,m375,DEBI,You're a government spook?
193339,L257326,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain ""Moral flexibility"" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called ""mechanical operations."" We sort of found each other..."
193340,L257325,u5661,m375,DEBI,Get the fuck outta here.
193341,L257324,u5668,m375,MARTIN,...About five years now.
193342,L257322,u5668,m375,MARTIN,It's something I do...
193343,L257321,u5661,m375,DEBI,Is it something you've done?
193344,L257320,u5668,m375,MARTIN,No.
193345,L257319,u5661,m375,DEBI,Not the other way around...?
193346,L257318,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Yes.
193347,L257317,u5661,m375,DEBI,"He was trying to kill you, right!"
193348,L257281,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Could be. The physical substance of love.
193349,L257280,u5661,m375,DEBI,Like love?
193350,L257279,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper."
193351,L257278,u5661,m375,DEBI,Like heroin?
193352,L257277,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood."
193353,L257269,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller."
193354,L257268,u5661,m375,DEBI,No time.
193355,L257267,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Wow. I have to give this some thought.
193356,L257266,u5661,m375,DEBI,"It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?"
193357,L257265,u5668,m375,MARTIN,--She's not dead---
193358,L257264,u5661,m375,DEBI,"Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--"
193359,L257263,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?"
193360,L257262,u5661,m375,DEBI,Which would you rather...?
193361,L257216,u5661,m375,DEBI,We haven't seen each other since high school.
193362,L257215,u5668,m375,MARTIN,--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
193363,L257168,u5661,m375,DEBI,What?
193364,L257167,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Shoulda brought my gun.
193365,L257148,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Right.
193366,L257147,u5661,m375,DEBI,I think they'll probably have booze there.
193367,L257146,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Do you want to get a drink first?
193368,L257132,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
193369,L257131,u5661,m375,DEBI,...Let me get my coat.
193370,L257130,u5661,m375,DEBI,Okay... Hold on...
193371,L257129,u5668,m375,MARTIN,You look beautiful.
193372,L257128,u5661,m375,DEBI,Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
193373,L257127,u5668,m375,MARTIN,As long as I get the laugh.
193374,L257126,u5661,m375,DEBI,Flowers. That's funny.
193375,L257095,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
193376,L257094,u5661,m375,DEBI,You're fucking psycho.
193377,L257093,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship."
193378,L257092,u5661,m375,DEBI,Hello...?
193379,L257091,u5661,m375,DEBI,Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
193380,L257090,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Yes.
193381,L257089,u5661,m375,DEBI,Are you there?
193382,L257071,u5661,m375,DEBI,I'll think about it.
193383,L257070,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Seven it is.
193384,L257069,u5661,m375,DEBI,Unbelievable.
193385,L257068,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Yes.
193386,L257067,u5661,m375,DEBI,"Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?"
193387,L257066,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
193388,L257064,u5668,m375,MARTIN,That'd be good.
193389,L257063,u5661,m375,DEBI,It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
193390,L257062,u5668,m375,MARTIN,What's that?
193391,L257061,u5661,m375,DEBI,Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
193392,L257060,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Bad television.
193393,L257059,u5661,m375,DEBI,Watched television?
193394,L257058,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Bad people.
193395,L257057,u5661,m375,DEBI,You met people.
193396,L257056,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Bad experiences.
193397,L257055,u5661,m375,DEBI,I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
193398,L257054,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Well, there's not much to tell."
193399,L257053,u5661,m375,DEBI,Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
193400,L257051,u5661,m375,DEBI,Yep.
193401,L257050,u5668,m375,MARTIN,It's always the little things.
193402,L257049,u5661,m375,DEBI,"Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view..."
193403,L257048,u5668,m375,MARTIN,That's part of it.
193404,L257047,u5661,m375,DEBI,No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
193405,L257046,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Are you going to the reunion?
193406,L256975,u5661,m375,DEBI,"Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?"
193407,L256974,u5668,m375,MARTIN,You see someone?
193408,L256973,u5661,m375,DEBI,"Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?"
193409,L256972,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really."
193410,L256971,u5661,m375,DEBI,--Torn down in the name of convenience--
193411,L256970,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--"
193412,L256969,u5661,m375,DEBI,"More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?"
193413,L256968,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Where have I been?
193414,L256967,u5661,m375,DEBI,"All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?"
193415,L256954,u5661,m375,DEBI,Okay.
193416,L256953,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back."
193417,L256951,u5661,m375,DEBI,Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
193418,L256950,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I'm a professional killer.
193419,L256949,u5661,m375,DEBI,What's your business?
193420,L256948,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Not much else.
193421,L256947,u5661,m375,DEBI,That's it?
193422,L256946,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really."
193423,L256945,u5661,m375,DEBI,Tell me about yourself.
193424,L256942,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Here is now there. There is here.
193425,L256941,u5661,m375,DEBI,"Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months."
193426,L256940,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Ten years, I think. What I miss?"
193427,L256939,u5661,m375,DEBI,Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
193428,L256938,u5668,m375,MARTIN,How long has it been?
193429,L256937,u5668,m375,MARTIN,It's nice to see you again.
193430,L256936,u5661,m375,DEBI,I just play my own collection.
193431,L257158,u5668,m375,MARTIN,This is me breating.
193432,L257157,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,"Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing."
193433,L257156,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure."
193434,L257155,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Out Loud?
193435,L257154,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,Okay. Repeat this after me.
193436,L257153,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion."
193437,L257152,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,What else? Say more.
193438,L256866,u5668,m375,MARTIN,If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
193439,L256865,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,"Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel."
193440,L256864,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Morality.
193441,L256863,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,What stuff?
193442,L256862,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway."
193443,L256861,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
193444,L256860,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys."
193445,L256857,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
193446,L256856,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
193447,L256855,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Mmm.
193448,L256854,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,Yes.
193449,L256853,u5668,m375,MARTIN,So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
193450,L256852,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,"I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, ""Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens.""  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families."
193451,L256851,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"We're both professionals, Oatman."
193452,L256850,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,You know where I live?
193453,L256849,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be ""withholding""... and I know where you live."
193454,L256848,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
193455,L256847,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  ""I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."""
193456,L256846,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,Say more.
193457,L256845,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I just know.
193458,L256844,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,How do you know?
193459,L256841,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
193460,L256840,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Shouldn't you be taking notes?
193461,L256839,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,"We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite."
193462,L256838,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Come on.
193463,L256837,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,You went to school with these people.
193464,L256836,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?"
193465,L256835,u5662,m375,DR. OATMAN,Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
193466,L256764,u5663,m375,DRIVER,"And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?"
193467,L256763,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Up on the right.
193468,L256762,u5663,m375,DRIVER,"I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain."
193469,L256761,u5663,m375,DRIVER,Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
193470,L256760,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Okay.

193536,L257166,u5666,m375,LARDNER,I love. I kill.
193537,L257165,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,One cannot love and kill.
193538,L257164,u5666,m375,LARDNER,You're wrong. Look at his face.

193542,L257102,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,"So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys."
193543,L257101,u5666,m375,LARDNER,"-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy."
193544,L257100,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,Wait a minute--
193545,L257099,u5666,m375,LARDNER,Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
193546,L257098,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,"Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here."
193547,L257097,u5666,m375,LARDNER,We can't do our job unless he does his job.
193548,L257096,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
193549,L256965,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,Whatever.
193550,L256964,u5666,m375,LARDNER,It was the PLO.
193551,L256963,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,That's strictly Bader-Meinhof stuff.
193552,L256962,u5666,m375,LARDNER,--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
193553,L256961,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,--Nooo--
193554,L256960,u5666,m375,LARDNER,"Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --"
193555,L256959,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,I don't think so.
193556,L256958,u5666,m375,LARDNER,Well?
193557,L256880,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,"In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn."
193558,L256879,u5666,m375,LARDNER,"Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?"
193559,L256878,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,"In Portugal, yes."
193560,L256877,u5666,m375,LARDNER,Lisbon?
193561,L256876,u5670,m375,MCCULLERS,"Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though."
193562,L256875,u5666,m375,LARDNER,"You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man."
193563,L257088,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,Will do.
193564,L257087,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great."
193565,L257086,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
193566,L257085,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Tell them my house exploded.
193567,L257084,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
193568,L257083,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
193569,L257082,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,You have.
193570,L257081,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I've looked at it.
193571,L257080,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,You haven't looked at the dossier.
193572,L257079,u5668,m375,MARTIN,It's fine.
193573,L257078,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,What's it look like?
193574,L257077,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I'll do it tomorrow.
193575,L257076,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,This is not good.

193577,L256832,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,Don't forget your identity.
193578,L256830,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
193579,L256829,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I have scruples. Next.
193580,L256828,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
193581,L256827,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Never enough.
193582,L256826,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,Enough?
193583,L256825,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,"Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one."
193584,L256824,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Good. What else? Anything interesting?
193585,L256823,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,"I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia."
193586,L256822,u5668,m375,MARTIN,There's nothing to be done about it.
193587,L256821,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,"And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one...."
193588,L256820,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,"Intractable, sir. You leave tonight."
193589,L256819,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Would you describe their position as inflexible?
193590,L256818,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,They were very upset.
193591,L256817,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
193592,L256816,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,In Detroit. This weekend.
193593,L256815,u5668,m375,MARTIN,And they want me to make up for it.
193594,L256814,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,They blame you for the compromise.
193595,L256813,u5668,m375,MARTIN,He didn't.
193596,L256812,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
193597,L256811,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I'm not happy.
193598,L256810,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,"They're not happy, sir."
193599,L256809,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I'll pay.
193600,L256808,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,That's going to cost.
193601,L256807,u5668,m375,MARTIN,And not show it to me. Ever again.
193602,L256806,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,All of it?
193603,L256805,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
193604,L256804,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
193605,L256803,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
193606,L256802,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,This?
193607,L256801,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Throw that away.
193608,L256776,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Patch him through....
193609,L256775,u5667,m375,MARCELLA,Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
193610,L256774,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella."
193611,L256924,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I have always thought about her and missed her.
193612,L256923,u5669,m375,MARY,And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
193613,L256922,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Yeah...
193614,L256921,u5669,m375,MARY,Take care of her. She's a keeper.
193615,L256920,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
193616,L256919,u5669,m375,MARY,Of course you will.
193617,L256918,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I think I'll go see Debi today.
193618,L256917,u5669,m375,MARY,Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
193619,L256916,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Yeah. I guess we did.
193620,L256915,u5669,m375,MARY,"We had a good laugh, didn't we?"
193621,L256914,u5669,m375,MARY,You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
193622,L256913,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"No, I don't have one."

193624,L256911,u5668,m375,MARTIN,You have a headache?
193625,L256910,u5669,m375,MARY,"Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache."
193626,L256909,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"They told me you're taking lithium, mom."
193627,L256908,u5669,m375,MARY,Nature made him then broke the mold.
193628,L256907,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
193629,L256906,u5669,m375,MARY,I spoke to your father the other day.
193630,L256905,u5668,m375,MARTIN,It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.

193636,L256899,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"That's wonderful, Mom."
193637,L256898,u5669,m375,MARY,I bought a new rug.

193643,L257310,u5668,m375,MARTIN,It didn't work out.
193644,L257308,u5672,m375,PAUL,As long as you had a good time.
193645,L257307,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
193646,L257306,u5672,m375,PAUL,What the hell happened to you?

193648,L257033,u5672,m375,PAUL,He gave me a great deal.
193649,L257032,u5668,m375,MARTIN,How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
193650,L257031,u5672,m375,PAUL,He sold me this bad boy.
193651,L257030,u5668,m375,MARTIN,He sells BMW's?
193652,L257028,u5672,m375,PAUL,Thank you.
193653,L257027,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer."
193654,L257026,u5672,m375,PAUL,Ten years. What happened!?
193655,L257025,u5668,m375,MARTIN,No.
193656,L257024,u5672,m375,PAUL,"Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?"
193657,L257023,u5668,m375,MARTIN,No. You drove us here.
193658,L257022,u5672,m375,PAUL,"Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?"
193659,L257021,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Debi's house.
193660,L257005,u5668,m375,MARTIN,You too.
193661,L257004,u5672,m375,PAUL,God it's great to see you.
193662,L257003,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Fair enough.
193663,L257002,u5672,m375,PAUL,"Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul."
193664,L257001,u5668,m375,MARTIN,So what happened to you?
193665,L256996,u5672,m375,PAUL,You're leaving me hanging here...
193666,L256995,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Paul?
193667,L256994,u5672,m375,PAUL,Marty! It's me. Paul.
193668,L257013,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Wow.
193669,L257012,u5673,m375,SOUTHTEC GUARD,"Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course..."
193670,L257011,u5668,m375,MARTIN,How did you get this job?
193671,L257010,u5673,m375,SOUTHTEC GUARD,To shoot you. Correct.
193672,L257009,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me."
193673,L257008,u5673,m375,SOUTHTEC GUARD,"Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer."
193674,L257007,u5668,m375,MARTIN,So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
193675,L257144,u5671,m375,MR. NEWBERRY,That's good.
193676,L257143,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I'm a professional killer.
193677,L257142,u5671,m375,MR. NEWBERRY,"So what are you doing with your life now, son?"
193678,L257141,u5668,m375,MARTIN,Why not?
193679,L257140,u5671,m375,MR. NEWBERRY,"Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?"
193680,L257139,u5668,m375,MARTIN,I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
193681,L257138,u5671,m375,MR. NEWBERRY,"I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek."
193682,L257137,u5668,m375,MARTIN,How's that?
193683,L257136,u5671,m375,MR. NEWBERRY,"Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong."
193684,L257135,u5668,m375,MARTIN,How are you? How's business?
193685,L257134,u5671,m375,MR. NEWBERRY,"Good evening, Mr. Blank."
193686,L257133,u5668,m375,MARTIN,"Good evening, Mr. Newberry."
193687,L258916,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Why?
193688,L258915,u5684,m376,TOM,The point was to love each other.
193689,L258914,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
193690,L258911,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Why?
193691,L258910,u5684,m376,TOM,"I don't know any other way, Annie."
193692,L258906,u5674,m376,ANNIE,How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
193693,L258905,u5684,m376,TOM,"I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set."
193694,L258903,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I can't do this. I can't leave you...
193695,L258902,u5684,m376,TOM,Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
193696,L258901,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I don't care! We'd be together.
193697,L258900,u5684,m376,TOM,"Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long."
193698,L258899,u5674,m376,ANNIE,One more time.
193699,L258898,u5684,m376,TOM,Annie!
193700,L258897,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Show me again.
193701,L258890,u5684,m376,TOM,"Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?"
193702,L258889,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --"
193703,L258888,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I won't ask you to.
193704,L258887,u5684,m376,TOM,I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
193705,L258848,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What?!
193706,L258847,u5684,m376,TOM,"Now, listen. I want you to stand on him."
193707,L258767,u5684,m376,TOM,Tom.
193708,L258766,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"This is Mr. Booker, Robert."
193709,L258616,u5684,m376,TOM,Huh?
193710,L258615,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You missed a button.
193711,L258614,u5684,m376,TOM,"Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta."
193712,L258613,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I am comfortable.
193713,L258612,u5684,m376,TOM,Just make yourself comfortable.
193714,L258611,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
193715,L258610,u5684,m376,TOM,Everything under control?
193716,L258587,u5674,m376,ANNIE,How did you find out all that?
193717,L258586,u5684,m376,TOM,"Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here."
193718,L258585,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"That's very important to you, isn't it? Home."
193719,L258584,u5684,m376,TOM,"I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em..."
193720,L258583,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be."
193721,L258582,u5684,m376,TOM,Ever think of moving there full time?
193722,L258581,u5674,m376,ANNIE,It is. It's lovely.
193723,L258580,u5684,m376,TOM,Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
193724,L258579,u5684,m376,TOM,She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
193725,L258578,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Why didn't it work out?
193726,L258576,u5684,m376,TOM,"College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was..."
193727,L258575,u5674,m376,ANNIE,How did you meet her?
193728,L258574,u5684,m376,TOM,"Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom."
193729,L258573,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Son?
193730,L258572,u5684,m376,TOM,Five years. My son was born here.
193731,L258571,u5674,m376,ANNIE,How long did you live here with your wife?
193732,L258566,u5674,m376,ANNIE,OK.
193733,L258565,u5684,m376,TOM,You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
193734,L258564,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Yeah.
193735,L258563,u5684,m376,TOM,Feel good?
193736,L258562,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Thanks.
193737,L258561,u5684,m376,TOM,"Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat."
193738,L258560,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead."
193739,L258559,u5684,m376,TOM,OK. I'll stop talking then.
193740,L258558,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas..."
193741,L258557,u5684,m376,TOM,Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
193742,L258556,u5684,m376,TOM,"No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra."
193743,L258555,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
193744,L258554,u5684,m376,TOM,"He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you."
193745,L258553,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Poor thing.
193746,L258552,u5684,m376,TOM,"You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out..."
193747,L258551,u5674,m376,ANNIE,The answer's no.
193748,L258514,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I can handle it!
193749,L258513,u5684,m376,TOM,Need a lift?
193750,L258512,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Shit.
193751,L258511,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You too.
193752,L258510,u5684,m376,TOM,Enjoy the day.
193753,L258509,u5684,m376,TOM,"Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home."
193754,L258508,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Are you shy, Mr. Booker?"
193755,L258505,u5674,m376,ANNIE,She did?
193756,L258504,u5684,m376,TOM,Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
193757,L258503,u5674,m376,ANNIE,He's beautiful.
193758,L258502,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Oh yes. I forgot.
193759,L258501,u5684,m376,TOM,It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
193760,L258500,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I have a way with animals.
193761,L258499,u5684,m376,TOM,"I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?"
193762,L258498,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I thought you lived in Chicago?
193763,L258497,u5684,m376,TOM,Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
193764,L258496,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
193765,L258494,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
193766,L258493,u5684,m376,TOM,You sleeping all right in that house?
193767,L258492,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies..."
193768,L258491,u5684,m376,TOM,Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
193769,L258490,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run."
193770,L258489,u5684,m376,TOM,"A jogger, huh?"
193771,L258488,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
193772,L258474,u5684,m376,TOM,Just who's been laughing at who here?
193773,L258473,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, I, uh... you didn't..."
193774,L258472,u5684,m376,TOM,I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
193775,L258471,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You were married to a woman in Chicago?
193776,L258470,u5684,m376,TOM,When I was first married.
193777,L258469,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You lived in Chicago?
193778,L258468,u5684,m376,TOM,Does Chicago count?
193779,L258467,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain."
193780,L258466,u5684,m376,TOM,What's that to miss?
193781,L258465,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?"
193782,L258464,u5684,m376,TOM,"Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little."
193783,L258463,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to."
193784,L258462,u5684,m376,TOM,"Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?"
193785,L258461,u5674,m376,ANNIE,That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
193786,L258460,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?"
193787,L258459,u5684,m376,TOM,You ever just stand still for a minute?
193788,L258458,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What?
193789,L258455,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
193790,L258454,u5684,m376,TOM,So how was your first and last day of branding?
193791,L258411,u5674,m376,ANNIE,It is cocktail hour yet?
193792,L258410,u5684,m376,TOM,You okay?
193793,L258391,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
193794,L258390,u5684,m376,TOM,"You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome."
193795,L258355,u5684,m376,TOM,That's up to Pilgrim.
193796,L258354,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?"
193797,L258353,u5684,m376,TOM,I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
193798,L258273,u5684,m376,TOM,"Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine."
193799,L258272,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--"
193800,L258269,u5684,m376,TOM,"You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go --  -- if you'll help.  You have a problem with that?"
193801,L258268,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, that'll be a little complicated --"
193802,L258267,u5684,m376,TOM,"When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too."
193803,L258261,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?"
193804,L258260,u5684,m376,TOM,Doesn't matter.
193805,L258259,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
193806,L258258,u5684,m376,TOM,"Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now."
193807,L258244,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Look! Please! Don't do the ""shucks, ma'am"" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?"
193808,L258243,u5684,m376,TOM,"I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --"
193809,L258242,u5684,m376,TOM,All by yourself?
193810,L258241,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
193811,L258240,u5684,m376,TOM,You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
193812,L258239,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's..."
193813,L258238,u5684,m376,TOM,Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
193814,L258237,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel..."
193815,L258236,u5684,m376,TOM,Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
193816,L258235,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs."
193817,L258093,u5684,m376,TOM,"I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now."
193818,L258092,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --"
193819,L258091,u5684,m376,TOM,"I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them."
193820,L258090,u5684,m376,TOM,"Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?"
193821,L258089,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
193822,L258088,u5684,m376,TOM,"Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of..."
193823,L258087,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner..."
193824,L258086,u5684,m376,TOM,"Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing."
193825,L258085,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --"
193826,L258084,u5684,m376,TOM,"Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems."
193827,L258083,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --"
193828,L258081,u5684,m376,TOM,Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
193829,L258080,u5674,m376,ANNIE,This is Annie MacLean.
193830,L258936,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Go ahead...
193831,L258935,u5678,m376,GRACE,Great!
193832,L258931,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Hi.
193833,L258930,u5678,m376,GRACE,Good.
193834,L258929,u5674,m376,ANNIE,How's everything?
193835,L258928,u5678,m376,GRACE,So do you.
193836,L258927,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful."
193837,L258885,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
193838,L258884,u5678,m376,GRACE,Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
193839,L258883,u5678,m376,GRACE,Tom's gone.
193840,L258882,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?"
193841,L258777,u5678,m376,GRACE,Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
193842,L258776,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Let's bring your bags inside.
193843,L258721,u5678,m376,GRACE,Sure.
193844,L258720,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?"
193845,L258719,u5678,m376,GRACE,Who is it?
193846,L258712,u5678,m376,GRACE,"So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway..."
193847,L258711,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What?
193848,L258710,u5678,m376,GRACE,"I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be..."
193849,L258709,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you."
193850,L258708,u5678,m376,GRACE,Why should they?
193851,L258707,u5674,m376,ANNIE,That's not true.
193852,L258706,u5678,m376,GRACE,Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
193853,L258705,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What?... Oh baby...
193854,L258704,u5678,m376,GRACE,Who's going to want me now?
193855,L258703,u5678,m376,GRACE,I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
193856,L258702,u5674,m376,ANNIE,When? Tonight?
193857,L258701,u5678,m376,GRACE,My period.
193858,L258700,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Started what?
193859,L258699,u5678,m376,GRACE,I said... I started.
193860,L258698,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What did you say?
193861,L258697,u5678,m376,GRACE,LEAVE ME ALONE!!
193862,L258696,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not."
193863,L258695,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Yeah, well, you've done a great job."
193864,L258694,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong."
193865,L258693,u5678,m376,GRACE,"FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!"
193866,L258692,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be."
193867,L258691,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Well, now you know what it feels like."
193868,L258690,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you."
193869,L258689,u5678,m376,GRACE,"NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom."
193870,L258688,u5674,m376,ANNIE,STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
193871,L258687,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Yeah, you know everything!!"
193872,L258686,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing..."
193873,L258685,u5678,m376,GRACE,Tom?
193874,L258684,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
193875,L258683,u5678,m376,GRACE,I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
193876,L258682,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Grace, I don't hate your father."
193877,L258681,u5678,m376,GRACE,You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
193878,L258680,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What are you talking about?
193879,L258679,u5678,m376,GRACE,... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
193880,L258678,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --"
193881,L258677,u5678,m376,GRACE,Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
193882,L258676,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Well...  So you tried riding again?
193883,L258675,u5678,m376,GRACE,About what?
193884,L258674,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
193885,L258666,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Did you go riding?
193886,L258665,u5678,m376,GRACE,Nothing.
193887,L258606,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Thanks, honey."
193888,L258605,u5678,m376,GRACE,I'll take care of it.
193889,L258604,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Does anybody out there want something to drink?
193890,L258603,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You're right. Good.
193891,L258602,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork."
193892,L258601,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, one was for salad..."
193893,L258600,u5678,m376,GRACE,I thought there were too many forks on the table.
193894,L258393,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way."
193895,L258392,u5678,m376,GRACE,I'll come.
193896,L258389,u5674,m376,ANNIE,No. I just thought... forget it.
193897,L258388,u5678,m376,GRACE,Why? There's no food in the house?
193898,L258387,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?"
193899,L258386,u5678,m376,GRACE,"If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy."
193900,L258385,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You got everything you need?
193901,L258376,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?"
193902,L258375,u5678,m376,GRACE,Did he mention it?
193903,L258374,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You already did.
193904,L258373,u5678,m376,GRACE,Did you ask him to come visit?
193905,L258358,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Hi.
193906,L258357,u5678,m376,GRACE,We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
193907,L258320,u5678,m376,GRACE,I think they call it a pasture.
193908,L258319,u5674,m376,ANNIE,He's still sitting in that damn field.
193909,L258220,u5678,m376,GRACE,I didn't see it.
193910,L258219,u5674,m376,ANNIE,There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
193911,L258218,u5678,m376,GRACE,"What would they say? ""Ten miles to big rock."" ""Twenty miles to bigger rock."""
193912,L258217,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Don't they believe in signs here?
193913,L258216,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Gee, this looks like a fun place."
193914,L258215,u5678,m376,GRACE,Little.
193915,L258214,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You buckled up?  You cold?
193916,L258209,u5678,m376,GRACE,"No, you just act like you do."
193917,L258208,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers."
193918,L258207,u5678,m376,GRACE,Then why do you want to leave?
193919,L258206,u5674,m376,ANNIE,That's not true!
193920,L258205,u5678,m376,GRACE,"He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him."
193921,L258204,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Did he tell you that?
193922,L258203,u5678,m376,GRACE,"You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to."
193923,L258202,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this."
193924,L258201,u5678,m376,GRACE,You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
193925,L258200,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I don't believe this!
193926,L258199,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!"
193927,L258198,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
193928,L258197,u5678,m376,GRACE,What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
193929,L258196,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
193930,L258195,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
193931,L258194,u5678,m376,GRACE,What?
193932,L258193,u5674,m376,ANNIE,How long is this going to go on?
193933,L258191,u5678,m376,GRACE,"You were never thirteen, Mom."
193934,L258190,u5674,m376,ANNIE,This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
193935,L258189,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I don't care.
193936,L258188,u5678,m376,GRACE,I don't care.
193937,L258187,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Would you like to see that?
193938,L258182,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You don't.
193939,L258181,u5678,m376,GRACE,I didn't know I had to.
193940,L258180,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Oh. You didn't tell me.
193941,L258179,u5678,m376,GRACE,I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
193942,L258178,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You should call your dad before it gets too late.
193943,L258175,u5678,m376,GRACE,Fine.
193944,L258174,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Fine!
193945,L258173,u5678,m376,GRACE,Whatever you want.
193946,L258172,u5674,m376,ANNIE,IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
193947,L258164,u5678,m376,GRACE,I don't care.
193948,L258163,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine."
193949,L258162,u5678,m376,GRACE,-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
193950,L258161,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --"
193951,L258160,u5678,m376,GRACE,Fine -- I'll take my bath.
193952,L258159,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
193953,L258110,u5678,m376,GRACE,"I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?"
193954,L258109,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What?
193955,L258108,u5678,m376,GRACE,Maybe they should put me down too.
193956,L258107,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Yeah?
193957,L258106,u5678,m376,GRACE,Mom?
193958,L258105,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
193959,L258104,u5678,m376,GRACE,I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
193960,L258103,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
193961,L258102,u5678,m376,GRACE,What about him?
193962,L258101,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Have you decided about Pilgrim?
193963,L258100,u5678,m376,GRACE,Doesn't matter.
193964,L258099,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Grace, I put it on the table near your --"
193965,L258098,u5678,m376,GRACE,"No, you didn't."
193966,L258097,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I brought it to you in the hospital.
193967,L258096,u5678,m376,GRACE,I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
193968,L258015,u5674,m376,ANNIE,It's still early. What's your next class?
193969,L258014,u5678,m376,GRACE,Fine!
193970,L258013,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
193971,L258012,u5678,m376,GRACE,Is that your version of a pep talk?
193972,L258011,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well..."
193973,L258010,u5678,m376,GRACE,I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
193974,L258009,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --"
193975,L258008,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all."
193976,L258007,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh, honey... What happened?"
193977,L258003,u5678,m376,GRACE,Okay.
193978,L258002,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Dad'll pick you up today, all right?"
193979,L257991,u5678,m376,GRACE,I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
193980,L257990,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Why don't you go lie down?
193981,L257982,u5678,m376,GRACE,I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
193982,L257981,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
193983,L258523,u5675,m376,DAVID GOTTSCHALK,All right. Speak to you then.
193984,L258522,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Uh, yes... Sure, David."
193985,L258520,u5675,m376,DAVID GOTTSCHALK,"If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?"
193986,L258519,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
193987,L258518,u5675,m376,DAVID GOTTSCHALK,"Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement."
193988,L258517,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything."
193989,L257890,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Exactly...
193990,L257889,u5675,m376,DAVID GOTTSCHALK,"Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud..."
193991,L257888,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?"
193992,L257887,u5675,m376,DAVID GOTTSCHALK,Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
193993,L257886,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Yes. We're suing.
193994,L257885,u5675,m376,DAVID GOTTSCHALK,Did you speak to Farlow?
193995,L257884,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
193996,L257883,u5675,m376,DAVID GOTTSCHALK,Who's there?
193997,L257882,u5674,m376,ANNIE,David?
193998,L258940,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
193999,L258939,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Where to?
194000,L258938,u5682,m376,ROBERT,You want to take a walk with me?
194001,L258937,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I have so much to tell you.
194002,L258934,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow."
194003,L258933,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Was the trip okay?
194004,L258926,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Tubab means white man.
194005,L258925,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What do you mean?
194006,L258924,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"No. I am a ""tubab."""
194007,L258923,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for ""Tubab"" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you ""Tubab""?"
194008,L258922,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Yes?
194009,L258881,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other."
194010,L258880,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I don't understa-
194011,L258879,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me."
194012,L258877,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What do you mean?
194013,L258876,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Take your time.
194014,L258875,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Yeah, what?"
194015,L258874,u5682,m376,ROBERT,May I have a suggestion?
194016,L258873,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
194017,L258872,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
194018,L258871,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
194019,L258811,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Let's not talk about that now.
194020,L258810,u5682,m376,ROBERT,How are you feeling about work?
194021,L258809,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right."
194022,L258808,u5682,m376,ROBERT,You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
194023,L258807,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
194024,L258806,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
194025,L258805,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured..."
194026,L258804,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You're allergic to hay.
194027,L258803,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
194028,L258487,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you."
194029,L258486,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
194030,L258485,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon."
194031,L258484,u5674,m376,ANNIE,About what?
194032,L258483,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried."
194033,L258482,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I wish I did.
194034,L258481,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her."
194035,L258480,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Huh-huh. You?
194036,L258479,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Everything all right.
194037,L258478,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Oh well... branding will do that to you.
194038,L258477,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off."
194039,L258476,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I thought you guys were going to call me.
194040,L258372,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Night.
194041,L258371,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Good night.
194042,L258370,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I know. We miss you too.
194043,L258369,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"I miss you, Annie."
194044,L258368,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Okay.
194045,L258367,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
194046,L258366,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know."
194047,L258365,u5682,m376,ROBERT,When are you coming home?
194048,L258364,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new."
194049,L258363,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?"
194050,L258362,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, it's good that you're there."
194051,L258361,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
194052,L258360,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?"
194053,L258152,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right."
194054,L258151,u5682,m376,ROBERT,And you think it's best if I don't come.
194055,L258150,u5674,m376,ANNIE,She will if you think she should.
194056,L258149,u5682,m376,ROBERT,What if she doesn't want to go?
194057,L258148,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!"
194058,L258147,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
194059,L258144,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I'm not pretending anything!
194060,L258143,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will."
194061,L258142,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
194062,L258141,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
194063,L258140,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
194064,L258139,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Why?!
194065,L258138,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea"
194066,L258137,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
194067,L258136,u5682,m376,ROBERT,What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
194068,L258135,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride."
194069,L258134,u5682,m376,ROBERT,You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
194070,L258133,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
194071,L258132,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
194072,L258131,u5674,m376,ANNIE,No. I was just researching. Calm down.
194073,L258130,u5682,m376,ROBERT,You've already made arrangements!?
194074,L258129,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
194075,L258128,u5682,m376,ROBERT,NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
194076,L258127,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her."
194077,L258126,u5682,m376,ROBERT,That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
194078,L258125,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"He did, but... I think I can change his mind."
194079,L258124,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I don't understand. You just said he said no.
194080,L258122,u5674,m376,ANNIE,About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
194081,L258121,u5682,m376,ROBERT,What was I saying?
194082,L258118,u5674,m376,ANNIE,No.
194083,L258117,u5682,m376,ROBERT,What did he say?
194084,L258116,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Yeah.
194085,L258115,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
194086,L258114,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there."
194087,L258113,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Why did you go?
194088,L258112,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"All our ""favorite"" people were there saying all their ""favorite"" things about their ""favorite"" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with."
194089,L258111,u5674,m376,ANNIE,How was the dinner?
194090,L257997,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
194091,L257996,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Doing what?
194092,L257995,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You've got to stop doing that?
194093,L257976,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Do you? Do you really?
194094,L257975,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I love you.
194095,L257974,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Aw... that's so sweet.
194096,L257973,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs."
194097,L257972,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
194098,L257971,u5682,m376,ROBERT,How's my pregnant chick!
194099,L257970,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Sing it to me, Frankie!"
194100,L257969,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"""... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'..."
194101,L257966,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Oh. Right. I'll call him.
194102,L257965,u5682,m376,ROBERT,... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
194103,L257964,u5682,m376,ROBERT,It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
194104,L257963,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Okay.
194105,L257962,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over..."
194106,L257961,u5682,m376,ROBERT,The funeral's on Friday.
194107,L257960,u5674,m376,ANNIE,We're very lucky.
194108,L257959,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
194109,L257958,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up."
194110,L257957,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"No, let me go."
194111,L257956,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I should go get some of her things.
194112,L257954,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
194113,L257953,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What did he say?
194114,L257930,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Tch. What are you --
194115,L257929,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I'm sorry.
194116,L257924,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Robert, you leave it up these people...!"
194117,L257923,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it."
194118,L257922,u5674,m376,ANNIE,That bag's almost empty.
194119,L257910,u5682,m376,ROBERT,She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
194120,L257909,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What about Grace?
194121,L257868,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Yeah. Bye.
194122,L257867,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Okay. We'll see you later then.
194123,L257866,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I don't know. We'll figure it out.
194124,L257865,u5682,m376,ROBERT,That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
194125,L257864,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
194126,L257863,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Riding with Judith.
194127,L257862,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Sure... What's Grace up to?
194128,L257861,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Okay. You want me to pick you up?
194129,L257860,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I should be in by two.
194130,L257859,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"So, what, uh, what train are you taking?"
194131,L257858,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Hi.
194132,L257857,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Hi.
194133,L257856,u5674,m376,ANNIE,It's me.
194134,L258853,u5677,m376,FRANK,Either fight the way things are or accept it.
194135,L258852,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What choice!!?
194136,L258851,u5677,m376,FRANK,No. He had the choice.
194137,L258850,u5674,m376,ANNIE,It's so cruel.
194138,L258631,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
194139,L258630,u5677,m376,FRANK,I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
194140,L258623,u5677,m376,FRANK,We have a business manager. The best around.
194141,L258622,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?"
194142,L258350,u5677,m376,FRANK,"Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears."
194143,L258349,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh, I don't know..."
194144,L258348,u5677,m376,FRANK,Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
194145,L258344,u5677,m376,FRANK,"Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?"
194146,L258343,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work."
194147,L258866,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"You too, Diane."
194148,L258865,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Good luck to you, Annie."
194149,L258864,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Promise.
194150,L258863,u5676,m376,DIANE,Promise?
194151,L258862,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks."
194152,L258860,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone."
194153,L258859,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing."
194154,L258799,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh, how sweet."
194155,L258798,u5676,m376,DIANE,I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
194156,L258780,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list."
194157,L258779,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Well, I am going to go after lunch."
194158,L258778,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
194159,L258764,u5676,m376,DIANE,"He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land."
194160,L258763,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
194161,L258762,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time."
194162,L258761,u5674,m376,ANNIE,What?
194163,L258760,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Yes, it does."
194164,L258759,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Sounds like something Tom would say.
194165,L258758,u5676,m376,DIANE,"They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all..."
194166,L258757,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Frank's a good man.
194167,L258756,u5676,m376,DIANE,"I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us."
194168,L258755,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
194169,L258754,u5676,m376,DIANE,Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
194170,L258753,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to."
194171,L258752,u5676,m376,DIANE,You don't seem to upset?
194172,L258751,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me."
194173,L258750,u5676,m376,DIANE,They fired you?
194174,L258749,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud."
194175,L258748,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?"
194176,L258651,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there."
194177,L258650,u5674,m376,ANNIE,You and Frank ever take a vacation?
194178,L258649,u5676,m376,DIANE,I'd love to go there one time...
194179,L258648,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe."
194180,L258647,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was..."
194181,L258646,u5676,m376,DIANE,What was it like?
194182,L258645,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"I was there for that shot, actually."
194183,L258644,u5676,m376,DIANE,I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
194184,L258643,u5676,m376,DIANE,"No reason you should, no reason you should."
194185,L258642,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to."
194186,L258641,u5676,m376,DIANE,I'll help you with the coffee.
194187,L258525,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway."
194188,L258524,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Thank you. You're all doing too much.
194189,L258445,u5674,m376,ANNIE,I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
194190,L258444,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise."
194191,L258443,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same."
194192,L258442,u5674,m376,ANNIE,She calls him Tommy...
194193,L258441,u5676,m376,DIANE,Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
194194,L258439,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow."
194195,L258438,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Where does this go, Diane?"
194196,L258346,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel."
194197,L258345,u5676,m376,DIANE,How's Peterson's holding up for you?
194198,L258332,u5676,m376,DIANE,No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
194199,L258331,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose."
194200,L258330,u5676,m376,DIANE,Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
194201,L258326,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah."
194202,L258325,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?"
194203,L258324,u5676,m376,DIANE,Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
194204,L258323,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
194205,L258322,u5676,m376,DIANE,There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
194206,L258158,u5681,m376,LIZ,Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
194207,L258157,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Of course not.
194208,L258156,u5681,m376,LIZ,"Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?"
194209,L258155,u5674,m376,ANNIE,Maybe we should give him another sedative.
194210,L257951,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please."
194211,L257950,u5681,m376,LIZ,It isn't right to make him suffer...
194212,L257949,u5674,m376,ANNIE,... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
194213,L257948,u5681,m376,LIZ,"Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same."
194214,L257947,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"- See, what you can do for him --..."
194215,L257946,u5681,m376,LIZ,"I understand, but Annie, please..."
194216,L257945,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --"
194217,L257938,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Well, of course, right..."
194218,L257937,u5681,m376,LIZ,"Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain..."
194219,L257936,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive..."
194220,L257934,u5681,m376,LIZ,"Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim."
194221,L257933,u5674,m376,ANNIE,"Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control."
194222,L257932,u5681,m376,LIZ,"Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?"
194223,L258856,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean."
194224,L258855,u5677,m376,FRANK,Diane!
194225,L258854,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter."
194226,L258743,u5676,m376,DIANE,You!
194227,L258742,u5677,m376,FRANK,Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
194228,L258352,u5677,m376,FRANK,"It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?"
194229,L258351,u5676,m376,DIANE,"They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy."
194230,L258285,u5677,m376,FRANK,"I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?"
194231,L258284,u5676,m376,DIANE,What?
194232,L258283,u5677,m376,FRANK,Mixed salad.
194233,L258280,u5676,m376,DIANE,"I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long."
194234,L258279,u5677,m376,FRANK,"Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it."
194235,L258278,u5676,m376,DIANE,"... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?"
194236,L258816,u5684,m376,TOM,No thanks.
194237,L258815,u5676,m376,DIANE,I have some brownies left over. Want one?
194238,L258626,u5676,m376,DIANE,Ain't brain surgery.
194239,L258625,u5684,m376,TOM,"Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny."
194240,L258624,u5676,m376,DIANE,Ha...
194241,L258287,u5676,m376,DIANE,"Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York."
194242,L258286,u5684,m376,TOM,"I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once."
194243,L258282,u5676,m376,DIANE,"What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger."
194244,L258281,u5684,m376,TOM,I don't believe they'll expect that.
194245,L258434,u5679,m376,JOE,"Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right."
194246,L258433,u5677,m376,FRANK,"Now son, you tell 'em when it came from."
194247,L258340,u5677,m376,FRANK,"Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink."
194248,L258339,u5679,m376,JOE,Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
194249,L258289,u5677,m376,FRANK,Weekend after next...
194250,L258288,u5679,m376,JOE,When you figure on branding?
194251,L258227,u5679,m376,JOE,"There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?"
194252,L258226,u5677,m376,FRANK,That's what some folks say.
194253,L258225,u5679,m376,JOE,"He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on."
194254,L258224,u5679,m376,JOE,There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
194255,L258223,u5677,m376,FRANK,Sure. As long as she don't mind.
194256,L258222,u5679,m376,JOE,"Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?"
194257,L258787,u5684,m376,TOM,He thought it was a ghost.
194258,L258786,u5677,m376,FRANK,"We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself."
194259,L258620,u5684,m376,TOM,I don't think Warren would go for that.
194260,L258619,u5677,m376,FRANK,It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
194261,L258436,u5677,m376,FRANK,"And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves..."
194262,L258435,u5684,m376,TOM,"Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding..."
194263,L258342,u5677,m376,FRANK,Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
194264,L258341,u5684,m376,TOM,They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
194265,L258338,u5684,m376,TOM,"We should be fine, then."
194266,L258337,u5677,m376,FRANK,Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
194267,L258295,u5684,m376,TOM,Yeah.
194268,L258294,u5677,m376,FRANK,Tom?
194269,L258233,u5677,m376,FRANK,You know her?
194270,L258232,u5684,m376,TOM,I don't believe it.
194271,L258747,u5678,m376,GRACE,"You know, you're a good kid."
194272,L258746,u5679,m376,JOE,I wouldn't let happen.
194273,L258745,u5678,m376,GRACE,I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
194274,L258744,u5679,m376,JOE,"You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?"
194275,L258593,u5679,m376,JOE,I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
194276,L258592,u5678,m376,GRACE,Of course I have.
194277,L258591,u5679,m376,JOE,Have you talked to Tom about it?
194278,L258590,u5678,m376,GRACE,Would you let me ride your horse?
194279,L258448,u5679,m376,JOE,Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
194280,L258447,u5678,m376,GRACE,Why do you always wear that hat?
194281,L258314,u5679,m376,JOE,Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
194282,L258313,u5678,m376,GRACE,Don't you go to school?
194283,L258842,u5684,m376,TOM,"Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time."
194284,L258841,u5678,m376,GRACE,No!
194285,L258840,u5684,m376,TOM,He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
194286,L258839,u5678,m376,GRACE,"No, you're only going to hurt him some more."
194287,L258838,u5684,m376,TOM,"Grace, I need you to come with me."
194288,L258826,u5678,m376,GRACE,I want to watch.
194289,L258825,u5684,m376,TOM,"It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done."
194290,L258824,u5678,m376,GRACE,What does that mean?
194291,L258823,u5684,m376,TOM,"There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?"
194292,L258820,u5678,m376,GRACE,Sure.
194293,L258819,u5684,m376,TOM,Sure?
194294,L258740,u5684,m376,TOM,There's no hurry. Take you time.
194295,L258739,u5678,m376,GRACE,I can't... not yet...
194296,L258737,u5684,m376,TOM,"I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think."
194297,L258736,u5678,m376,GRACE,I know where he goes.
194298,L258735,u5684,m376,TOM,"I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere..."
194299,L258546,u5684,m376,TOM,"Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?"
194300,L258545,u5678,m376,GRACE,Are you afraid of anything?
194301,L258544,u5684,m376,TOM,That must have been pretty special.
194302,L258543,u5678,m376,GRACE,We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
194303,L258542,u5684,m376,TOM,Where did you get Pilgrim from?
194304,L258541,u5684,m376,TOM,Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
194305,L258540,u5678,m376,GRACE,I don't know if I can.
194306,L258539,u5684,m376,TOM,Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
194307,L258536,u5684,m376,TOM,"Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas."
194308,L258535,u5678,m376,GRACE,I don't know if I can with my leg.
194309,L258534,u5684,m376,TOM,"Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake."
194310,L258533,u5684,m376,TOM,I don't have all day.
194311,L258532,u5678,m376,GRACE,I can't...
194312,L258531,u5684,m376,TOM,It's never too soon to start.
194313,L258530,u5678,m376,GRACE,Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
194314,L258529,u5684,m376,TOM,Can you drive?
194315,L258409,u5684,m376,TOM,You're catching on.
194316,L258408,u5678,m376,GRACE,"That's not a question, is it?"
194317,L258271,u5684,m376,TOM,Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
194318,L258270,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Isn't it like, obvious?"
194319,L258256,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?"
194320,L258255,u5684,m376,TOM,Mmm. An editor.
194321,L258254,u5678,m376,GRACE,She's an editor.
194322,L258253,u5684,m376,TOM,What does she do?
194323,L258252,u5678,m376,GRACE,Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
194324,L258251,u5684,m376,TOM,She gonna be long?
194325,L258248,u5684,m376,TOM,"Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?"
194326,L258247,u5678,m376,GRACE,Yeah?
194327,L257901,u5680,m376,JUDITH,I'm okay... I'm okay.
194328,L257900,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Jude, you okay?"
194329,L257894,u5678,m376,GRACE,"No, wait, it just goes... ""he said he liked to do-""..."
194330,L257893,u5680,m376,JUDITH,"""... and I said that""..."
194331,L257875,u5680,m376,JUDITH,We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
194332,L257874,u5678,m376,GRACE,You want to go down or stay along the river?
194333,L257873,u5680,m376,JUDITH,Why don't we just cut through the woods?
194334,L257872,u5678,m376,GRACE,Do you want to go around by the old road?
194335,L257871,u5680,m376,JUDITH,I just could never say it!
194336,L257870,u5678,m376,GRACE,"...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!"
194337,L257851,u5678,m376,GRACE,Can I come? I'll start a fire...
194338,L257850,u5680,m376,JUDITH,My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
194339,L257849,u5678,m376,GRACE,So?
194340,L257848,u5680,m376,JUDITH,I thought your mom's coming up?
194341,L257847,u5678,m376,GRACE,You want to go to a movie tonight?
194342,L257846,u5680,m376,JUDITH,It's warmer than I thought.
194343,L258869,u5678,m376,GRACE,I did. He said he had work to do until late.
194344,L258868,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
194345,L258773,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?"
194346,L258772,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I know. Amazing.
194347,L258771,u5678,m376,GRACE,Did you notice -- no cane?
194348,L258019,u5678,m376,GRACE,I want to see Pilgrim.
194349,L258018,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"What, sweetheart?"
194350,L258000,u5678,m376,GRACE,NO!
194351,L257999,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"Honey, you all right? Did something fall?"
194352,L257993,u5678,m376,GRACE,Maybe... look -- just...
194353,L257992,u5682,m376,ROBERT,You want to watch some television?
194354,L257989,u5678,m376,GRACE,"No, I'm just not that hungry."
194355,L257988,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?"
194356,L257986,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"OK, OK."
194357,L257985,u5678,m376,GRACE,"Dad! I can do it, OK?!"
194358,L257980,u5678,m376,GRACE,How's Pilgrim doing?
194359,L257979,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"No, not yet."
194360,L257978,u5678,m376,GRACE,Have you heard from Judith's parents?
194361,L258660,u5685,m376,TWIN,You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
194362,L258659,u5679,m376,JOE,"You shut up, stupid!"
194363,L258658,u5685,m376,TWIN,You just showing off for her!
194364,L258657,u5679,m376,JOE,Don't be such a baby!
194365,L258654,u5685,m376,TWIN,WAS SO!
194366,L258653,u5679,m376,JOE,YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
194367,L258652,u5685,m376,TWIN,IT WAS MY TURN!
194368,L258790,u5682,m376,ROBERT,"I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger."
194369,L258789,u5684,m376,TOM,"Is the poverty worse, now, you think?"
194370,L258785,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I understand...
194371,L258784,u5684,m376,TOM,"Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim."
194372,L258783,u5682,m376,ROBERT,How much longer do you think?
194373,L258782,u5684,m376,TOM,We still have a way to go.
194374,L258781,u5682,m376,ROBERT,I can't believe it's the same horse.
194375,L258769,u5684,m376,TOM,Oh yeah...
194376,L258768,u5682,m376,ROBERT,Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
194377,L258077,u5683,m376,RONA,Honey... I was always good.
194378,L258076,u5684,m376,TOM,"You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together."
194379,L258074,u5684,m376,TOM,Sometimes.
194380,L258073,u5683,m376,RONA,Does a horse miss a saddle?
194381,L258072,u5684,m376,TOM,You ever miss it?
194382,L258071,u5683,m376,RONA,Long enough.
194383,L258070,u5684,m376,TOM,How long were you married?
194384,L258069,u5683,m376,RONA,"What are you looking at, young man?"
194385,L258068,u5683,m376,RONA,The number's by the phone.
194386,L258067,u5684,m376,TOM,"I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up."
194387,L258066,u5683,m376,RONA,Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
194388,L258042,u5684,m376,TOM,Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
194389,L258041,u5683,m376,RONA,Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
194390,L258040,u5684,m376,TOM,"If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might."
194391,L258039,u5683,m376,RONA,Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
194392,L258038,u5684,m376,TOM,You're looking fit.
194393,L258037,u5683,m376,RONA,I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
194394,L258036,u5684,m376,TOM,"Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late."
194395,L258035,u5683,m376,RONA,"Hey, darlin'."
194396,L258065,u5684,m376,TOM,"Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up."
194397,L258064,u5686,m376,WOMAN,What do you mean?
194398,L258063,u5684,m376,TOM,"Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts."
194399,L258062,u5686,m376,WOMAN,About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
194400,L258061,u5684,m376,TOM,What stuff is that?
194401,L258060,u5686,m376,WOMAN,Where did you learn all this stuff?
194402,L258059,u5684,m376,TOM,"Well, that'll happen."
194403,L259271,u5687,m377,AGENT BOB,Don't move!
194404,L259270,u5688,m377,AGENT RAY,Secret Service!
194405,L259254,u5687,m377,AGENT BOB,It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
194406,L259253,u5688,m377,AGENT RAY,It's cool!
194407,L259252,u5687,m377,AGENT BOB,You think it's cool?
194408,L259251,u5688,m377,AGENT RAY,"Yeah, cool."
194409,L259250,u5687,m377,AGENT BOB,Cool?
194410,L259249,u5688,m377,AGENT RAY,Now that's cool.
194411,L259248,u5687,m377,AGENT BOB,"Listen to this bullshit.  ""This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto."" Huh, right, manifesto? ""You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."""
194412,L259193,u5688,m377,AGENT RAY,Alright sir.
194413,L259192,u5692,m377,GILL,"Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation."
194414,L259191,u5688,m377,AGENT RAY,"I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files."
194415,L259190,u5692,m377,GILL,"In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot."
194416,L259189,u5688,m377,AGENT RAY,"It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive."
194417,L259188,u5692,m377,GILL,"How's it going, Ray?"
194418,L259572,u5689,m377,BLADE,How are you going to take care of the cops?
194419,L259571,u5704,m377,RAZOR,"Hackers of the World, Unite!"
194420,L259570,u5689,m377,BLADE,"That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal."
194421,L259567,u5689,m377,BLADE,"See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show."
194422,L259566,u5704,m377,RAZOR,"She's rabid, but cute."
194423,L259562,u5704,m377,RAZOR,Waste the dude.
194424,L259561,u5689,m377,BLADE,Let's keep her.
194425,L259180,u5689,m377,BLADE,"Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!"
194426,L259179,u5704,m377,RAZOR,...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
194427,L259178,u5689,m377,BLADE,And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
194428,L259177,u5704,m377,RAZOR,Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
194429,L259176,u5689,m377,BLADE,"As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters."
194430,L259167,u5689,m377,BLADE,Hack the Planet!
194431,L259166,u5704,m377,RAZOR,Welcome to our show!
194432,L259541,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
194433,L259540,u5691,m377,DADE,What?
194434,L259444,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
194435,L259443,u5691,m377,DADE,"I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry."
194436,L259331,u5691,m377,DADE,The sensitive type.
194437,L259330,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Right.
194438,L259317,u5691,m377,DADE,Was that her top?
194439,L259316,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Shh!
194440,L259315,u5691,m377,DADE,Shit!
194441,L259256,u5691,m377,DADE,What is it with this guy?
194442,L259255,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?"
194443,L259115,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!"
194444,L259114,u5691,m377,DADE,"Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door."
194445,L259100,u5691,m377,DADE,The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
194446,L259099,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Oh yeah? What's that?
194447,L259098,u5691,m377,DADE,Dragon book. Compiler design.
194448,L259097,u5690,m377,CEREAL,What's that?
194449,L259096,u5691,m377,DADE,Devil book. The Unix Bible.
194450,L259095,u5690,m377,CEREAL,What's that?
194451,L259547,u5690,m377,CEREAL,A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
194452,L259546,u5699,m377,NIKON,Damn!
194453,L259539,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?"
194454,L259538,u5699,m377,NIKON,"Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts."
194455,L259533,u5699,m377,NIKON,...as they snoop onto us.
194456,L259532,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Snoop onto them...
194457,L259517,u5699,m377,NIKON,"Yo, brain dead, the manual!"
194458,L259516,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Ta-da!
194459,L259497,u5699,m377,NIKON,"This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!"
194460,L259496,u5690,m377,CEREAL,That's far out!
194461,L259495,u5699,m377,NIKON,"Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!"
194462,L259491,u5699,m377,NIKON,"Yo, man, you an amateur, man."
194463,L259490,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!"
194464,L259468,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Looks like a hacker wrote it.
194465,L259467,u5699,m377,NIKON,"Look at this, it's so lean and clean."
194466,L259466,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Hold on a second!
194467,L259397,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Super hero like even.
194468,L259396,u5699,m377,NIKON,Very impressive.
194469,L259311,u5699,m377,NIKON,I want it.
194470,L259310,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!"
194471,L259159,u5699,m377,NIKON,Again?  Yeah sure.
194472,L259158,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?"
194473,L259319,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Difficulty rating?
194474,L259318,u5702,m377,PHREAK,One-handed!
194475,L259314,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"Yo, hit the lights."
194476,L259313,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark."
194477,L259312,u5702,m377,PHREAK,I want it to have my children!
194478,L259259,u5702,m377,PHREAK,Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
194479,L259258,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
194480,L259257,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?"
194481,L259122,u5690,m377,CEREAL,I'm gonna hit you!
194482,L259121,u5702,m377,PHREAK,You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
194483,L259120,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"It was him, man!"
194484,L259119,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"Cereal, man, you owe me a pack."
194485,L259113,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?"
194486,L259112,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?"
194487,L259111,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit."
194488,L259110,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
194489,L259106,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Stupid, man. It's universally stupid."
194490,L259105,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?"
194491,L259085,u5702,m377,PHREAK,Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
194492,L259084,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks."
194493,L259581,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Roger.
194494,L259580,u5695,m377,KATE,Go fix the phones.
194495,L259579,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Yeah?
194496,L259578,u5695,m377,KATE,Cereal.
194497,L259577,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?"
194498,L259545,u5695,m377,KATE,"Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  ""Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers"" - they blame hackers!"
194499,L259544,u5690,m377,CEREAL,Well this hasn't happened yet.
194500,L259507,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six."
194501,L259506,u5695,m377,KATE,"Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven."
194502,L259505,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Oh wow, we are fried."
194503,L259442,u5695,m377,KATE,Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
194504,L259441,u5690,m377,CEREAL,"Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on."
194505,L259401,u5691,m377,DADE,"Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date."
194506,L259400,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round."
194507,L259395,u5691,m377,DADE,"Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus."
194508,L259394,u5702,m377,PHREAK,Dead?
194509,L259393,u5691,m377,DADE,Dead.
194510,L259309,u5691,m377,DADE,Yeah? Display?
194511,L259308,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!"
194512,L259261,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?"
194513,L259260,u5691,m377,DADE,Did you talk to him?
194514,L259149,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"No, don't know who he is.  Do you?"
194515,L259148,u5691,m377,DADE,You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
194516,L259048,u5702,m377,PHREAK,"That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day."
194517,L259047,u5691,m377,DADE,And what's he do?
194518,L259046,u5702,m377,PHREAK,Curtis.
194519,L259045,u5691,m377,DADE,Who's that?
194520,L259082,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,And unpack.
194521,L259081,u5691,m377,DADE,"Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass."
194522,L259079,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,"Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out?"
194523,L259078,u5691,m377,DADE,No. No one special.
194524,L259077,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
194525,L259076,u5691,m377,DADE,Revenge.
194526,L259075,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,What did we learn in school today?
194527,L259074,u5691,m377,DADE,Hmmm.
194528,L259073,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,How was school?
194529,L258987,u5691,m377,DADE,"Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!"
194530,L258986,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,"You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!"
194531,L258985,u5691,m377,DADE,"Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet."
194532,L258984,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,"Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?"
194533,L258983,u5691,m377,DADE,"Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?"
194534,L258982,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,"Up all night again, huh?"
194535,L258981,u5691,m377,DADE,Mm-hmm.
194536,L258980,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
194537,L258954,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,"Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday."
194538,L258953,u5691,m377,DADE,I'm taking over a TV network.
194539,L258952,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,What are you doing?
194540,L258951,u5691,m377,DADE,"Yeah, mom?"
194541,L258950,u5698,m377,MRS. MURPHY,Dade?
194542,L259618,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,"This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!"
194543,L259617,u5691,m377,DADE,I found it! I found it!
194544,L259608,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,Give it up! Just give it up.
194545,L259607,u5691,m377,DADE,"Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole."
194546,L259606,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,"Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit."
194547,L259462,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,"Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?"
194548,L259461,u5691,m377,DADE,"I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone."
194549,L259460,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,Talk to me.
194550,L259459,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,"Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!"
194551,L259458,u5691,m377,DADE,You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
194552,L259457,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,"What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched."
194553,L259456,u5691,m377,DADE,That's bullshit.
194554,L259455,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,"Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears."
194555,L259454,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
194556,L259453,u5691,m377,DADE,"I told you, I don't play well with others."
194557,L259452,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
194558,L259292,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,Thank you!
194559,L259291,u5691,m377,DADE,Blow me.
194560,L259290,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,"I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?"
194561,L259288,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,"Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love."
194562,L259287,u5691,m377,DADE,Shit! Come on!
194563,L259286,u5691,m377,DADE,Nah. I don't play well with others.
194564,L259285,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,"I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?"
194565,L259284,u5691,m377,DADE,I'm sorry. Who are you?
194566,L259283,u5703,m377,PLAGUE,"Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you."
194567,L259636,u5691,m377,DADE,We did it!
194568,L259635,u5699,m377,NIKON,Yes!
194569,L259620,u5699,m377,NIKON,Joey's getting stupid busy.
194570,L259619,u5691,m377,DADE,"Oh, shit! He got me."
194571,L259509,u5691,m377,DADE,Okay. Let's go shopping.
194572,L259508,u5699,m377,NIKON,"Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man."
194573,L259504,u5699,m377,NIKON,"Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes."
194574,L259503,u5691,m377,DADE,"Fucked if I care, man."
194575,L259502,u5699,m377,NIKON,"They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun."
194576,L259482,u5691,m377,DADE,"And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about..."
194577,L259481,u5699,m377,NIKON,Two days.
194578,L259474,u5691,m377,DADE,It nibbles. You see this?
194579,L259473,u5699,m377,NIKON,What's this one eat?
194580,L259472,u5691,m377,DADE,This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
194581,L259321,u5691,m377,DADE,Burn!
194582,L259320,u5699,m377,NIKON,Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
194583,L259299,u5699,m377,NIKON,I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!
194584,L259298,u5691,m377,DADE,How did you know that?
194585,L259297,u5699,m377,NIKON,"Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!"
194586,L259173,u5691,m377,DADE,Razor and Blade.
194587,L259172,u5699,m377,NIKON,That's Razor and Blade.
194588,L259164,u5691,m377,DADE,What's going on?
194589,L259163,u5699,m377,NIKON,"Yo, showtime, showtime!"
194590,L259153,u5691,m377,DADE,No.
194591,L259152,u5699,m377,NIKON,Never heard of you. Done anything?
194592,L259151,u5691,m377,DADE,Crash Override.
194593,L259690,u5695,m377,KATE,Dreams?
194594,L259689,u5691,m377,DADE,"You know, I've been having these really weird.."
194595,L259686,u5695,m377,KATE,"Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble."
194596,L259685,u5691,m377,DADE,"They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite."
194597,L259684,u5695,m377,KATE,I can't believe they decided you won.
194598,L259683,u5691,m377,DADE,Wanna go for a swim?
194599,L259682,u5695,m377,KATE,You would have looked better.
194600,L259681,u5691,m377,DADE,You look good in a dress.
194601,L259662,u5691,m377,DADE,Yeah.
194602,L259661,u5695,m377,KATE,"Oh, wow, she's great."
194603,L259653,u5695,m377,KATE,Thanks for your help.
194604,L259652,u5691,m377,DADE,What?
194605,L259651,u5695,m377,KATE,Dade.
194606,L259650,u5691,m377,DADE,I'm trying to help you.
194607,L259649,u5695,m377,KATE,Are you crazy? What are you doing?
194608,L259604,u5691,m377,DADE,"Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time."
194609,L259603,u5695,m377,KATE,"It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast."
194610,L259587,u5695,m377,KATE,"Alright, let's boot up."
194611,L259586,u5691,m377,DADE,Yeah.
194612,L259585,u5695,m377,KATE,Ready?
194613,L259565,u5695,m377,KATE,We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
194614,L259564,u5691,m377,DADE,It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
194615,L259563,u5695,m377,KATE,A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
194616,L259553,u5695,m377,KATE,They're elite! Let's get 'em.
194617,L259552,u5691,m377,DADE,Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
194618,L259551,u5695,m377,KATE,There they are!
194619,L259537,u5691,m377,DADE,"Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson."
194620,L259536,u5695,m377,KATE,"Alright, so what have we got?"
194621,L259514,u5695,m377,KATE,It's my subway defense system.
194622,L259513,u5691,m377,DADE,Shit!!
194623,L259501,u5691,m377,DADE,I'll hack the Gibson.
194624,L259500,u5695,m377,KATE,How?
194625,L259499,u5691,m377,DADE,I'll make it up to you!
194626,L259498,u5695,m377,KATE,Well that's great. There goes MIT.
194627,L259493,u5691,m377,DADE,I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
194628,L259492,u5695,m377,KATE,Why did he come to you?
194629,L259489,u5691,m377,DADE,I didn't know what was on it.
194630,L259488,u5695,m377,KATE,You what?
194631,L259487,u5691,m377,DADE,This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
194632,L259486,u5695,m377,KATE,What?
194633,L259485,u5691,m377,DADE,"I know, I know who wrote it."
194634,L259484,u5695,m377,KATE,"Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it."
194635,L259480,u5695,m377,KATE,"Right, and at this rate it ends its run in..."
194636,L259479,u5691,m377,DADE,"Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started."
194637,L259478,u5695,m377,KATE,"Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks."
194638,L259477,u5691,m377,DADE,And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
194639,L259476,u5695,m377,KATE,The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
194640,L259475,u5691,m377,DADE,"This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas."
194641,L259465,u5691,m377,DADE,I have to tell you something.
194642,L259464,u5695,m377,KATE,"Uh, hold on..."
194643,L259463,u5691,m377,DADE,"Kate, listen."
194644,L259451,u5695,m377,KATE,"Okay, thank you."
194645,L259450,u5691,m377,DADE,Okay. I'll copy it.
194646,L259449,u5695,m377,KATE,Thank you.
194647,L259447,u5695,m377,KATE,"Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?"
194648,L259446,u5691,m377,DADE,"I'm sorry, I can't."
194649,L259445,u5695,m377,KATE,"What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help."
194650,L259440,u5691,m377,DADE,Do my ears deceive me?
194651,L259439,u5695,m377,KATE,We need your help.
194652,L259370,u5695,m377,KATE,"I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on."
194653,L259369,u5691,m377,DADE,And you have to smile.
194654,L259368,u5695,m377,KATE,You're not gonna win.
194655,L259367,u5691,m377,DADE,Make it our first date.
194656,L259366,u5695,m377,KATE,Make it my first born.
194657,L259365,u5691,m377,DADE,And if I win?
194658,L259364,u5695,m377,KATE,"You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want."
194659,L259363,u5691,m377,DADE,Your slave?
194660,L259362,u5695,m377,KATE,"If I win, you become my slave."
194661,L259361,u5691,m377,DADE,Name your stakes.

194888,L260318,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,"Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search."
194889,L260317,u5707,m378,COP,I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
194890,L260313,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,"Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone."

194896,L260426,u5719,m378,RACHEL,"I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard."
194897,L260425,u5708,m378,DARLENE,We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.

194911,L260581,u5708,m378,DARLENE,We should call the fire department.

194913,L260579,u5708,m378,DARLENE,Because the lights are all out.

194917,L260268,u5720,m378,RICHARD,Why not?
194918,L260267,u5708,m378,DARLENE,"Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight."
194919,L260266,u5720,m378,RICHARD,Found it.
194920,L260263,u5720,m378,RICHARD,"Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck."
194921,L260262,u5708,m378,DARLENE,Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
194922,L260258,u5720,m378,RICHARD,It's okay..it's okay.
194923,L260257,u5708,m378,DARLENE,"Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream."
194924,L260321,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will."
194925,L260320,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,Now where are you going?
194926,L260311,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,How many bodies did you find?
194927,L260310,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,Four plus Myers.
194928,L260309,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,How many people in the bus?
194929,L260308,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,Why shouldn't I?
194930,L260297,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
194931,L260296,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
194932,L260295,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,I can see this is useless.
194933,L260294,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
194934,L260293,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,"For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law."
194935,L260292,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
194936,L260291,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,About what?
194937,L260290,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Why wasn't I notified?
194938,L260229,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,Drive Carefully.

194940,L260227,u5717,m378,MAN,Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
194941,L260226,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
194942,L260225,u5717,m378,MAN,Watch it.
194943,L260223,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,"If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die."
194944,L260222,u5717,m378,MAN,I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
194945,L260221,u5717,m378,MAN,Check him out.
194946,L260220,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,Outside.

194949,L260217,u5717,m378,MAN,Has he been prepped?
194950,L260216,u5709,m378,DR. HOFFMAN,"I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator."
194951,L260215,u5717,m378,MAN,Yes.
194952,L260780,u5710,m378,EARL,"Okay, out."

194954,L260778,u5710,m378,EARL,"Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?"
194955,L260585,u5710,m378,EARL,"You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers."
194956,L260584,u5711,m378,GUY,"Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster."
194957,L260567,u5711,m378,GUY,Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
194958,L260566,u5710,m378,EARL,Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?

194962,L260518,u5710,m378,EARL,We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
194963,L260511,u5710,m378,EARL,Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
194964,L260510,u5711,m378,GUY,Who you calling?
194965,L260509,u5710,m378,EARL,"Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun."
194966,L260508,u5711,m378,GUY,Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
194967,L260749,u5712,m378,JAMIE,Rachel!

195031,L260760,u5712,m378,JAMIE,Then we'll be safe?
195032,L260759,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,We'll hear sirens soon.
195033,L260756,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
195034,L260755,u5712,m378,JAMIE,Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
195035,L260754,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,What are you doing out here alone?
195036,L260633,u5713,m378,KELLY,All right.
195037,L260632,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Why don't you go make some coffee.
195038,L260629,u5718,m378,MEEKER,All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
195039,L260628,u5713,m378,KELLY,"That's all the windows, Dad."
195040,L260600,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Just do it.
195041,L260599,u5713,m378,KELLY,Why?
195042,L260598,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows."
195043,L260597,u5713,m378,KELLY,"Dad, what's going on?"
195044,L260596,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right."
195045,L260669,u5713,m378,KELLY,"Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman."
195046,L260668,u5719,m378,RACHEL,Don't you mean what you do best?
195047,L260667,u5713,m378,KELLY,"He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me."
195048,L260666,u5719,m378,RACHEL,You knew. You just didn't care.
195049,L260665,u5713,m378,KELLY,I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
195050,L260486,u5719,m378,RACHEL,Hi.
195051,L260485,u5713,m378,KELLY,Hi Rachel.
195052,L260374,u5714,m378,LINDSAY,"Okay, bye."
195053,L260373,u5719,m378,RACHEL,Call me.
195054,L260360,u5719,m378,RACHEL,Jamie?
195055,L260359,u5714,m378,LINDSAY,Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
195056,L260358,u5719,m378,RACHEL,I don't know.
195057,L260357,u5714,m378,LINDSAY,"Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit."
195058,L260356,u5719,m378,RACHEL,Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
195059,L260355,u5714,m378,LINDSAY,You won't come on too strong.
195060,L260354,u5719,m378,RACHEL,Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
195061,L260353,u5714,m378,LINDSAY,You won't look pushy.
195062,L260352,u5719,m378,RACHEL,I don't want to look pushy.
195063,L260351,u5714,m378,LINDSAY,I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
195064,L260350,u5719,m378,RACHEL,No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
195065,L260349,u5714,m378,LINDSAY,"You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes."
195066,L260344,u5714,m378,LINDSAY,Hi Jamie.
195067,L260343,u5719,m378,RACHEL,You remember Lindsay don't you?
195068,L260663,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try."
195069,L260662,u5715,m378,LOGAN,Do you?
195070,L260661,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,The state police won't know how to stop him.
195071,L260660,u5715,m378,LOGAN,Leave Myers for the state boys.
195072,L260659,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go."
195073,L260658,u5715,m378,LOGAN,Where are you going?
195074,L260657,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Its not over yet.
195075,L260656,u5715,m378,LOGAN,Hell of a night.
195076,L260683,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
195077,L260682,u5715,m378,LOGAN,Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
195078,L260681,u5718,m378,MEEKER,I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
195079,L260631,u5715,m378,LOGAN,Got it Ben.
195080,L260630,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?"
195081,L260619,u5718,m378,MEEKER,If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
195082,L260618,u5715,m378,LOGAN,Isn't this all a little paranoid?
195083,L260617,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Making sure that no one can get in here.
195084,L260616,u5715,m378,LOGAN,What are we doing?
195085,L260615,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Get the outside shutters.
195086,L260609,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Go get it.
195087,L260608,u5715,m378,LOGAN,Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
195088,L260607,u5718,m378,MEEKER,You got your riot gun?
195089,L260576,u5715,m378,LOGAN,I'll be there in 5 minutes.
195090,L260575,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
195091,L260574,u5715,m378,LOGAN,Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
195092,L260573,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"This is 132, over."
195093,L260572,u5715,m378,LOGAN,132 to 133 this is 134.
195094,L260529,u5715,m378,LOGAN,"No problem, Sheriff."
195095,L260528,u5718,m378,MEEKER,You look sharp. You understand?
195096,L260527,u5715,m378,LOGAN,"Right here, Ben."
195097,L260526,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back."
195098,L260800,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory."
195099,L260799,u5718,m378,MEEKER,These kids aren't likely to forget.
195100,L260798,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs."
195101,L260797,u5718,m378,MEEKER,It's over.
195102,L260639,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
195103,L260638,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,How's it powered?
195104,L260602,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?"
195105,L260601,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Where's the radio?
195106,L260595,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Be here in a minute.
195107,L260594,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Where's that Deputy?
195108,L260570,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
195109,L260569,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob."
195110,L260565,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
195111,L260564,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
195112,L260558,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Evil.
195113,L260557,u5718,m378,MEEKER,What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
195114,L260556,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,It isn't a man.
195115,L260555,u5718,m378,MEEKER,How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
195116,L260554,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,They didn't know what they were fighting.
195117,L260553,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
195118,L260548,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Dear God.
195119,L260547,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Oh Christ. Doc...
195120,L260546,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Yes.
195121,L260545,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Is that him? Is that him?
195122,L260525,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Least I'm not alone.
195123,L260524,u5718,m378,MEEKER,This is starting to spook me.
195124,L260523,u5718,m378,MEEKER,How do you know?
195125,L260522,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,He's been here.
195126,L260521,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Something?
195127,L260467,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl."
195128,L260466,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,When he makes that call.
195129,L260463,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors."
195130,L260462,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?"
195131,L260461,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"Its true, Sheriff."
195132,L260460,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true.."
195133,L260459,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way."
195134,L260458,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
195135,L260457,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger."
195136,L260456,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
195137,L260455,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter."
195138,L260454,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Why?
195139,L260453,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"He's here, Sheriff."
195140,L260452,u5718,m378,MEEKER,That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
195141,L260451,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
195142,L260450,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
195143,L260449,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ..."
195144,L260448,u5718,m378,MEEKER,I am. Ben Meeker.
195145,L260418,u5721,m378,SAYER,Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink?
195146,L260417,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,I know that Mr. Sayer.
195147,L260416,u5721,m378,SAYER,"Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name."
195148,L260415,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?"
195149,L260414,u5721,m378,SAYER,"Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me."
195150,L260413,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Sort of.
195151,L260412,u5721,m378,SAYER,Car trouble?
195152,L260411,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Loomis. Haddonfield.
195153,L260410,u5721,m378,SAYER,"Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah"
195154,L260409,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,"How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?"
195155,L260408,u5721,m378,SAYER,"Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts."
195156,L260407,u5716,m378,LOOMIS,Thank you.
195157,L260794,u5719,m378,RACHEL,Don't touch him Jamie!
195158,L260793,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Jamie! Get away!
195159,L260791,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
195160,L260790,u5719,m378,RACHEL,"Sheriff Meeker, we killed him."
195161,L260680,u5719,m378,RACHEL,Uh huh.
195162,L260679,u5718,m378,MEEKER,Now you understand?
195163,L260678,u5719,m378,RACHEL,Okay.
195164,L260677,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan."
195165,L260676,u5719,m378,RACHEL,"Sheriff, what is going on out there?"
195166,L260543,u5719,m378,RACHEL,What's going on?
195167,L260542,u5718,m378,MEEKER,"Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!"
195168,L259912,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"He shouts, too."
195169,L259911,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,You're going to be late!
195170,L259910,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Huh?
195171,L259909,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,"You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie."
195172,L259907,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,"The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?"
195173,L259906,u5722,m379,ANNIE,You blame everything on kids.
195174,L259905,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
195175,L259904,u5722,m379,ANNIE,What happened?
195176,L259903,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,What?
195177,L259902,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Hi, Dad. What happened?"
195178,L259901,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,"Hi, Annie, Laurie..."
195179,L259832,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Fun-ny. See you.
195180,L259831,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Saving the treats for Bob?
195181,L259830,u5729,m379,LYNDA,I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
195182,L259829,u5722,m379,ANNIE,What time?
195183,L259826,u5722,m379,ANNIE,All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
195184,L259825,u5729,m379,LYNDA,"Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week."
195185,L259824,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda."
195186,L259823,u5729,m379,LYNDA,"Well, are we still on for tonight?"
195187,L259809,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
195188,L259808,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Sure.
195189,L259807,u5722,m379,ANNIE,We just talked.
195190,L259806,u5729,m379,LYNDA,It's been totally charted.
195191,L259802,u5722,m379,ANNIE,That's not true. Here I am.
195192,L259801,u5729,m379,LYNDA,We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
195193,L259800,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Why didn't you wait for me?
195194,L260045,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so."
195195,L260044,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded."
195196,L260043,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning."
195197,L260042,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Wait a minute here...
195198,L260041,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul."
195199,L260040,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Yes, you can."
195200,L260039,u5722,m379,ANNIE,I can't.
195201,L260038,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
195202,L260037,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window..."
195203,L260036,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Fancy.
195204,L259970,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Annie!
195205,L259969,u5722,m379,ANNIE,You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
195206,L259966,u5722,m379,ANNIE,You guys will make a fabulous couple.
195207,L259965,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't."
195208,L259964,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him."
195209,L259963,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I'd say you must have the wrong number.
195210,L259962,u5722,m379,ANNIE,What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
195211,L259961,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"What's this big, big news?"
195212,L259960,u5722,m379,ANNIE,I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
195213,L259899,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her."
195214,L259898,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Thanks.
195215,L259897,u5722,m379,ANNIE,I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
195216,L259896,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
195217,L259895,u5722,m379,ANNIE,What's the pumpkin for?
195218,L259894,u5722,m379,ANNIE,That's probably all he can do.
195219,L259893,u5726,m379,LAURIE,He can still watch.
195220,L259892,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven."
195221,L259891,u5726,m379,LAURIE,He was watching me.
195222,L259890,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Probably Mister Riddle.
195223,L259889,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
195224,L259888,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Lies.
195225,L259887,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I wasn't spooked.
195226,L259886,u5722,m379,ANNIE,You still spooked?
195227,L259872,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Bye.
195228,L259871,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Sure, see you later."
195229,L259870,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30."
195230,L259869,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I've already lost it.
195231,L259868,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie."
195232,L259867,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I thought it was an obscene phone call.
195233,L259866,u5722,m379,ANNIE,I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
195234,L259865,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
195235,L259864,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Of course.
195236,L259863,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Annie, was that you?"
195237,L259862,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Why did you hang up on me?
195238,L259861,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Hello?
195239,L259848,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Okay. Bye.
195240,L259847,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later."
195241,L259845,u5726,m379,LAURIE,The guys think I'm too smart.
195242,L259844,u5722,m379,ANNIE,It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
195243,L259843,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Cute.
195244,L259842,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
195245,L259841,u5726,m379,LAURIE,He was standing right here.
195246,L259838,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!"
195247,L259837,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at."
195248,L259836,u5722,m379,ANNIE,I don't see anything.
195249,L259835,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Behind that bush there.
195250,L259834,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Look where?
195251,L259833,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Look.
195252,L259828,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you."
195253,L259827,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
195254,L259814,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I forgot my chemistry book.
195255,L259813,u5722,m379,ANNIE,I have a place for that.
195256,L259812,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Shit!
195257,L259805,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Exploring uncharted territory?
195258,L259804,u5722,m379,ANNIE,I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
195259,L259803,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling."
195260,L260033,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Come with me.
195261,L260032,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,Yes.
195262,L260030,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,I want to stay here and watch this.
195263,L260029,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other..."
195264,L260028,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,I don't want to.
195265,L260027,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul."
195266,L260026,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,I don't know.
195267,L260025,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
195268,L260024,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,I'm scared.
195269,L260019,u5722,m379,ANNIE,I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
195270,L260018,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,You locked yourself in.
195271,L260017,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!"
195272,L260016,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,"Annie, Paul's on the phone!"
195273,L259977,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,"No, he's not."
195274,L259976,u5722,m379,ANNIE,"Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again."
195275,L259959,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,"Here, Lester."
195276,L259958,u5722,m379,ANNIE,Get him out of here!
195277,L260125,u5729,m379,LYNDA,YEAH?
195278,L260124,u5723,m379,BOB,I thought you were gonna get one for me.
195279,L260123,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Go get me a beer.
195280,L260122,u5723,m379,BOB,Yeah.
195281,L260121,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Is that all you say?
195282,L260120,u5723,m379,BOB,Yeah.
195283,L260119,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Want a beer?
195284,L260118,u5723,m379,BOB,Yeah.
195285,L260117,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Fantastic. Totally.
195286,L260115,u5729,m379,LYNDA,I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
195287,L260114,u5723,m379,BOB,Just answer the damn phone.
195288,L260113,u5729,m379,LYNDA,That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
195289,L260112,u5729,m379,LYNDA,And I can't keep you interested?
195290,L260111,u5723,m379,BOB,I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
195291,L260090,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
195292,L260089,u5723,m379,BOB,I wonder where they went.
195293,L260086,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Totally...
195294,L260085,u5723,m379,BOB,...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
195295,L260084,u5729,m379,LYNDA,You idiot!
195296,L260083,u5723,m379,BOB,Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
195297,L260082,u5729,m379,LYNDA,"Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?"
195298,L259705,u5724,m379,BOYFRIEND,Yeah.
195299,L259704,u5732,m379,SISTER,Promise?
195300,L259703,u5724,m379,BOYFRIEND,"Yeah, sure."
195301,L259702,u5732,m379,SISTER,Will you call me tomorrow?
195302,L259701,u5724,m379,BOYFRIEND,I gotta go.
195303,L259699,u5732,m379,SISTER,Michael's around someplace...
195304,L259698,u5724,m379,BOYFRIEND,"We're all alone, aren't we?"
195305,L259697,u5724,m379,BOYFRIEND,Are you sure?
195306,L259696,u5732,m379,SISTER,My parents won't be back till ten.
195307,L260174,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
195308,L260173,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,Where?
195309,L260172,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,I found the car! He's here!
195310,L260171,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
195311,L260081,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,"I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out."
195312,L260080,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,They could be.
195313,L260079,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,"More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse."
195314,L260078,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,"I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it."
195315,L260077,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,"Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes."
195316,L260076,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Exactly what do you need?
195317,L260075,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
195318,L260074,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,You have the wrong feeling.
195319,L260073,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,"Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this..."
195320,L260072,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Sure...
195321,L260071,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,You all right?
195322,L260070,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Jesus!
195323,L259944,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,I'll check back in an hour.
195324,L259943,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,"If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes."
195325,L259942,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
195326,L259941,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,"He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him."
195327,L259940,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,What do we do?
195328,L259939,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,"I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil."
195329,L259938,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
195330,L259937,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
195331,L259932,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,He isn't a man.
195332,L259931,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,A man wouldn't do that...
195333,L259930,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Could have...
195334,L259929,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
195335,L259924,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,They may be right.
195336,L259923,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,"Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted."
195337,L259922,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Anybody live here?
195338,L259921,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,I'll be here.
195339,L259920,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,Ten minutes.
195340,L259919,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,It's important.
195341,L259918,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
195342,L259917,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,"I'd like to talk to you, if I could."
195343,L259916,u5725,m379,BRACKETT,Lee Brackett.
195344,L259915,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
195345,L260106,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Have a good time.
195346,L260105,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Okay. Later.
195347,L260104,u5726,m379,LAURIE,They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
195348,L260103,u5729,m379,LYNDA,"Well, she's totally not here."
195349,L260102,u5726,m379,LAURIE,No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
195350,L260101,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Is Annie around?
195351,L260100,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
195352,L260099,u5729,m379,LYNDA,"Hi, Laurie, what's up?"
195353,L259821,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Totally.
195354,L259820,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble."
195355,L259817,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I don't think so...
195356,L259816,u5729,m379,LYNDA,Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
195357,L259811,u5729,m379,LYNDA,The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
195358,L259810,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I thought you were babysitting tonight.
195359,L259798,u5729,m379,LYNDA,It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
195360,L259797,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"As usual, I don't have anything to do."
195361,L259796,u5729,m379,LYNDA,TOTALLY!
195362,L259795,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
195363,L259794,u5729,m379,LYNDA,"It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!"
195364,L260191,u5726,m379,LAURIE,No! Do as I say.
195365,L260190,u5733,m379,TOMMY,"Laurie, you come with us..."
195366,L260184,u5733,m379,TOMMY,But you can't kill the bogyman.
195367,L260183,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I killed him...
195368,L260182,u5733,m379,TOMMY,How?
195369,L260181,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Yes.
195370,L260180,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Are you sure?
195371,L260177,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Was it the bogyman?
195372,L260176,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside."
195373,L260169,u5726,m379,LAURIE,HURRY!
195374,L260168,u5733,m379,TOMMY,"It's the bogyman, isn't it?"
195375,L260167,u5726,m379,LAURIE,DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
195376,L260166,u5733,m379,TOMMY,I'm scared...
195377,L260165,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
195378,L260164,u5733,m379,TOMMY,"What is it, Laurie?"
195379,L260163,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs..."
195380,L260162,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Tommy, let me in!"
195381,L260161,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Who is it?
195382,L260059,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed."
195383,L260058,u5733,m379,TOMMY,I saw him...
195384,L260057,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey."
195385,L259999,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
195386,L259998,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I promise.
195387,L259997,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Promise?
195388,L259996,u5726,m379,LAURIE,And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
195389,L259995,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Right.
195390,L259994,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?"
195391,L259993,u5733,m379,TOMMY,The bogyman!
195392,L259992,u5726,m379,LAURIE,What did he look like?
195393,L259991,u5733,m379,TOMMY,There WAS.
195394,L259990,u5726,m379,LAURIE,There was no one outside.
195395,L259989,u5733,m379,TOMMY,I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
195396,L259988,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe."
195397,L259987,u5733,m379,TOMMY,No...
195398,L259986,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
195399,L259985,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
195400,L259984,u5726,m379,LAURIE,There is no such thing.
195401,L259983,u5733,m379,TOMMY,What about the bogyman?
195402,L259982,u5726,m379,LAURIE,After the Jack-O-Lantern.
195403,L259981,u5733,m379,TOMMY,What about the rest of my comic books?
195404,L259980,u5726,m379,LAURIE,After the movie.
195405,L259979,u5733,m379,TOMMY,What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
195406,L259968,u5726,m379,LAURIE,I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
195407,L259967,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Laurie...
195408,L259952,u5733,m379,TOMMY,"Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?"
195409,L259951,u5726,m379,LAURIE,'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
195410,L259950,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Mom doesn't like me to have them.
195411,L259949,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Why are they under there?
195412,L259948,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Not any more.
195413,L259947,u5726,m379,LAURIE,But king Arthur was always your favorite.
195414,L259946,u5733,m379,TOMMY,I don't like that story.
195415,L259945,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"...""how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."""
195416,L259760,u5726,m379,LAURIE,See you.
195417,L259759,u5733,m379,TOMMY,I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
195418,L259758,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
195419,L259757,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
195420,L259756,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Just watch.
195421,L259755,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
195422,L259754,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Yes, I am."
195423,L259752,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Sure. Sure.
195424,L259751,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
195425,L259750,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Sure.
195426,L259749,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Can we watch the monster movies?
195427,L259748,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Sure.
195428,L259747,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
195429,L259746,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Same time, same place."
195430,L259745,u5733,m379,TOMMY,Are you coming over tonight?
195431,L259744,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Hi, Tommy."
195432,L259743,u5733,m379,TOMMY,"Hey, Laurie..."
195433,L260189,u5726,m379,LAURIE,Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
195434,L260188,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,You're coming with us...
195435,L260187,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door."
195436,L260179,u5726,m379,LAURIE,There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
195437,L260178,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,I'm scared!
195438,L260097,u5726,m379,LAURIE,You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
195439,L260096,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,Let's make more popcorn.
195440,L260095,u5726,m379,LAURIE,"Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?"
195441,L260015,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,Okay.
195442,L260014,u5731,m379,PAUL,"Well, go tell her it's me, okay?"
195443,L260013,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,She's washing her clothes.
195444,L260012,u5731,m379,PAUL,Will you get her for me?
195445,L260011,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,"Yes, she is."
195446,L260010,u5731,m379,PAUL,"Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?"
195447,L260009,u5727,m379,LINDSEY,Hello.
195448,L259774,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
195449,L259773,u5734,m379,WYNN,"Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive."
195450,L259772,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,I'm wasting time.
195451,L259771,u5734,m379,WYNN,PROBABLY going.
195452,L259770,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
195453,L259769,u5734,m379,WYNN,There's nothing else I can do.
195454,L259768,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
195455,L259767,u5734,m379,WYNN,"He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified..."
195456,L259766,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
195457,L259765,u5734,m379,WYNN,I've given them his profile.
195458,L259764,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Of course not.
195459,L259763,u5734,m379,WYNN,"I'm not responsible, Sam."
195460,L259735,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,"He said something else. ""It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."""
195461,L259734,u5730,m379,MARION,I don't think this is any time to be funny...
195462,L259733,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
195463,L259732,u5730,m379,MARION,What did he say?
195464,L259731,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Move it!
195465,L259730,u5730,m379,MARION,Shouldn't we pick him up?
195466,L259729,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Pull up to the entrance!
195467,L259727,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
195468,L259726,u5730,m379,MARION,The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
195469,L259725,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,I couldn't if I tried.
195470,L259724,u5730,m379,MARION,You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
195471,L259723,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,It means... I see.
195472,L259722,u5730,m379,MARION,What does that mean?
195473,L259721,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,I see.
195474,L259720,u5730,m379,MARION,Only minimum security.
195475,L259719,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Ever done anything like this before?
195476,L259718,u5730,m379,MARION,"Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor."
195477,L259717,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,If you say so.
195478,L259716,u5730,m379,MARION,I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
195479,L259715,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
195480,L259714,u5730,m379,MARION,Are there any special instructions?
195481,L259713,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
195482,L259712,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,That's the idea. Here we are.
195483,L259711,u5730,m379,MARION,He'll barely be able to sit up.
195484,L259710,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,Thorazin.
195485,L259709,u5730,m379,MARION,What did you use before?
195486,L259708,u5728,m379,LOOMIS,"...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way."
195487,L261892,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I can't believe it!
195488,L261891,u5735,m380,APRIL,I love that.  That's my type.
195489,L261890,u5735,m380,APRIL,He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
195490,L261889,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Mmm?
195491,L261888,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil."
195492,L261884,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, listen..."
195493,L261883,u5735,m380,APRIL,...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
195494,L261882,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Come in, come in."
195495,L261881,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Oh, good..."
195496,L261879,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Mm-mm!
195497,L261878,u5735,m380,APRIL,...any sister talk?
195498,L262289,u5735,m380,APRIL,Great.
195499,L262288,u5737,m380,DAVID,"And then, uh, April...huh?"
195500,L262287,u5735,m380,APRIL,Yeah.
195501,L262269,u5735,m380,APRIL,Uh --
195502,L262268,u5737,m380,DAVID,"Uh, who gets dropped first?"
195503,L262262,u5735,m380,APRIL,A lot of works.
195504,L262261,u5737,m380,DAVID,Yeah.
195505,L262252,u5737,m380,DAVID,Look at this.
195506,L262251,u5735,m380,APRIL,That's just --
195507,L262240,u5735,m380,APRIL,Great.
195508,L262239,u5737,m380,DAVID,"Well, let's do it."
195509,L262238,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Oh, yeah."
195510,L262237,u5737,m380,DAVID,You want to see some?
195511,L262236,u5735,m380,APRIL,"What are your favorite buildings, David?"
195512,L262234,u5735,m380,APRIL,Oh--
195513,L262233,u5737,m380,DAVID,"You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment."
195514,L262218,u5735,m380,APRIL,Yeah.
195515,L262217,u5737,m380,DAVID,Are you really interested?
195516,L262216,u5735,m380,APRIL,Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
195517,L262201,u5735,m380,APRIL,Oh.
195518,L262200,u5737,m380,DAVID,Hi.
195519,L262195,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Well, let's hope so."
195520,L262194,u5737,m380,DAVID,And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
195521,L262193,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crpes caviar."
195522,L262192,u5737,m380,DAVID,I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
195523,L262191,u5735,m380,APRIL,"We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi."
195524,L262856,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?"
195525,L262855,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say."
195526,L262854,u5735,m380,APRIL,"I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing."
195527,L262853,u5747,m380,HOLLY,But I'm seeing him.
195528,L262852,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me."
195529,L262851,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"And you, you-you're going?"
195530,L262850,u5735,m380,APRIL,He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
195531,L262849,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"I, uh, I'm very surprised."
195532,L262848,u5735,m380,APRIL,"No, he called late last night."
195533,L262847,u5747,m380,HOLLY,You're joking.
195534,L262846,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say."
195535,L262845,u5747,m380,HOLLY,What?
195536,L262844,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Oh, uh, listen, David called me up."
195537,L262843,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health."
195538,L262842,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money."
195539,L262841,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised."
195540,L262282,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um..."
195541,L262281,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Well, sometimes, some, uh..."
195542,L262278,u5735,m380,APRIL,"If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?"
195543,L262277,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Uh...
195544,L262276,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Well, wait.  You know what?  I know."
195545,L262275,u5747,m380,HOLLY,It depends on what way you want to go.
195546,L262274,u5735,m380,APRIL,Uh...
195547,L262273,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, I, we both live downtown."
195548,L262272,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Well, I live downtown."
195549,L262267,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Okay.
195550,L262266,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Oh, geez, yeah."
195551,L262260,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah.
195552,L262259,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though."
195553,L262255,u5747,m380,HOLLY,It's really terrible.
195554,L262254,u5735,m380,APRIL,...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
195555,L262253,u5747,m380,HOLLY,That's disgusting!
195556,L262246,u5735,m380,APRIL,It feels like you're in France.
195557,L262245,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah.
195558,L262244,u5735,m380,APRIL,"It's French, though.  It really is."
195559,L262232,u5735,m380,APRIL,"It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes."
195560,L262231,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Right.
195561,L262230,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know."
195562,L262229,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Oh, is that what it is?"
195563,L262228,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Oh!
195564,L262222,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Oh, it's magnificent!"
195565,L262221,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Wow, it's the red one?"
195566,L262180,u5735,m380,APRIL,"Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit."
195567,L262179,u5747,m380,HOLLY,We're a big hit.
195568,L261896,u5735,m380,APRIL,Mmm.
195569,L261895,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
195570,L261894,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"No, really, we mustn't get discouraged."
195571,L261893,u5735,m380,APRIL,"No, really, I really like him a lot."
195572,L261886,u5735,m380,APRIL,"I mean, I've looked everywhere."
195573,L261885,u5747,m380,HOLLY,I know.  It's terrible!
195574,L262434,u5752,m380,NORMAN,And maybe my lawyer.
195575,L262433,u5736,m380,CAROL,"Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine."
195576,L262432,u5752,m380,NORMAN,"I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor."
195577,L262407,u5736,m380,CAROL,"Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks."
195578,L262406,u5752,m380,NORMAN,Hmm?
195579,L262405,u5736,m380,CAROL,Right.
195580,L262404,u5752,m380,NORMAN,We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
195581,L262403,u5736,m380,CAROL,"Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm."
195582,L262402,u5752,m380,NORMAN,Mm-hm.
195583,L262400,u5752,m380,NORMAN,"No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for."
195584,L262399,u5736,m380,CAROL,"Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote."
195585,L262286,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, okay."
195586,L262285,u5737,m380,DAVID,"Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first."
195587,L262284,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yes.
195588,L262283,u5737,m380,DAVID,"Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?"
195589,L262280,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?"
195590,L262279,u5737,m380,DAVID,We could...we could do that.
195591,L262271,u5737,m380,DAVID,Well...
195592,L262270,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um..."
195593,L262265,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Fast.
195594,L262264,u5737,m380,DAVID,"Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?"
195595,L262263,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah.
195596,L262258,u5737,m380,DAVID,It does.
195597,L262257,u5747,m380,HOLLY,And it ruins everything else.
195598,L262256,u5737,m380,DAVID,It's really sad.
195599,L262250,u5737,m380,DAVID,"They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then..."
195600,L262249,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah.
195601,L262248,u5737,m380,DAVID,And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
195602,L262243,u5747,m380,HOLLY,...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
195603,L262242,u5737,m380,DAVID,Yes.
195604,L262241,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown..."
195605,L262227,u5737,m380,DAVID,And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite.
195606,L262226,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Uh-huh.
195607,L262225,u5737,m380,DAVID,"The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions."
195608,L262224,u5747,m380,HOLLY,It's terrific!
195609,L262223,u5737,m380,DAVID,Yeah.
195610,L262220,u5737,m380,DAVID,What time do you get off?
195611,L262219,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah.
195612,L262215,u5737,m380,DAVID,I'm an architect.
195613,L262214,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, what, what do you do?"
195614,L262211,u5737,m380,DAVID,I cry at the opera.
195615,L262210,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried..."
195616,L262206,u5747,m380,HOLLY,What makes you think we're more interesting?
195617,L262205,u5737,m380,DAVID,Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
195618,L262204,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company."
195619,L262203,u5737,m380,DAVID,You're Holly.
195620,L262197,u5737,m380,DAVID,Ah! HOLLY  Now.
195621,L262196,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams."
195622,L262190,u5737,m380,DAVID,Oh no.  Not at all.
195623,L262189,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Really?  Is the food that bad?
195624,L262188,u5737,m380,DAVID,Is this your first job?
195625,L262187,u5747,m380,HOLLY,We're actresses.
195626,L262186,u5737,m380,DAVID,"Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong."
195627,L262185,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
195628,L262184,u5737,m380,DAVID,I can't resist.
195629,L262183,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
195630,L262182,u5737,m380,DAVID,"Excuse me, are there any more claims?"
195631,L262125,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
195632,L262124,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Like what?
195633,L262123,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,"You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things."
195634,L262122,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera."
195635,L262121,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,"Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing."
195636,L262120,u5750,m380,MICKEY,The hospital?  What kind of tests?
195637,L262119,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,"What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests."
195638,L262118,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?"
195639,L262117,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,And it's just in one ear?
195640,L262116,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?"
195641,L262115,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,"You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?"
195642,L262114,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?"
195643,L262113,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,When did you first notice this?
195644,L262112,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I always, I-I always imagine that I have things."
195645,L262111,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me."
195646,L262110,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,"Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?"
195647,L262109,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Really?!
195648,L262108,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,"Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear."
195649,L262107,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,Let's take a look.
195650,L262106,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Now I ca-can't remember.
195651,L262105,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear."
195652,L262104,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
195653,L262103,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--"
195654,L262102,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,"...and, uh, he complained of chest pains."
195655,L262101,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Mm-hm.
195656,L262100,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,"You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus..."
195657,L262099,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--"
195658,L262097,u5750,m380,MICKEY,This time I really think I have something.
195659,L262096,u5738,m380,DR. ABEL,"So what's the, uh, problem this time?"
195660,L262510,u5739,m380,DUSTY,"Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead."
195661,L262509,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead."
195662,L262508,u5739,m380,DUSTY,It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
195663,L262507,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
195664,L262506,u5739,m380,DUSTY,What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
195665,L262445,u5739,m380,DUSTY,"Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's very beautiful.  Big, weird...you know.  If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird."
195666,L262444,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"I told him about your work, and he's very excited."
195667,L262443,u5739,m380,DUSTY,"How ya doin', man?"
195668,L262441,u5739,m380,DUSTY,"Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space."
195669,L262440,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
195670,L262457,u5739,m380,DUSTY,'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
195671,L262456,u5749,m380,LEE,"Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big."
195672,L262455,u5739,m380,DUSTY,"Well, are...are they big?"
195673,L262454,u5749,m380,LEE,Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
195674,L262449,u5749,m380,LEE,Uh-huh.
195675,L262448,u5739,m380,DUSTY,"I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid."
195676,L262447,u5749,m380,LEE,Yeah?
195677,L262446,u5749,m380,LEE,Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
195678,L262439,u5739,m380,DUSTY,Hi.
195679,L262438,u5749,m380,LEE,"Hi, Dusty."
195680,L262019,u5740,m380,ED,...cannot go on the air.
195681,L262018,u5750,m380,MICKEY,We--
195682,L262015,u5750,m380,MICKEY,We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
195683,L262014,u5740,m380,ED,"Yes, but you name names."
195684,L262013,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
195685,L262012,u5740,m380,ED,...with the affiliates.
195686,L262011,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Could you--
195687,L262010,u5740,m380,ED,Child molestation is a touchy subject...
195688,L262009,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?"
195689,L262008,u5740,m380,ED,"Ed Smythe, yes."
195690,L262007,u5750,m380,MICKEY,You--  Standards and Practices?
195691,L263053,u5749,m380,LEE,"Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!"
195692,L263052,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,Lee...
195693,L263051,u5749,m380,LEE,"I care a great deal about him, yes."
195694,L263050,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,And you're in love overnight?
195695,L263046,u5749,m380,LEE,"Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else."
195696,L263045,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Yeah, but we-we made so many plans."
195697,L263044,u5749,m380,LEE,"It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know."
195698,L263043,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,But it hasn't been forever.
195699,L263042,u5749,m380,LEE,I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
195700,L263041,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
195701,L263040,u5749,m380,LEE,"Look, I'm just as much at fault."
195702,L263039,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
195703,L263038,u5749,m380,LEE,"It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore."
195704,L263011,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, not here.  There are too many people around."
195705,L263010,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,Is something wrong?
195706,L263009,u5749,m380,LEE,No.
195707,L263008,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,You've been very cold to me tonight.
195708,L262632,u5749,m380,LEE,I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
195709,L262631,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me."
195710,L262630,u5749,m380,LEE,I know she must be a really passionate person.
195711,L262629,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, all the time."
195712,L262628,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"You really do have those thoughts, don't you?"
195713,L262627,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Oh, my God."
195714,L262626,u5749,m380,LEE,I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
195715,L262625,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
195716,L262624,u5749,m380,LEE,That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
195717,L262623,u5749,m380,LEE,I know it isn't.
195718,L262622,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,This is not an easy situation.
195719,L262619,u5749,m380,LEE,I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
195720,L262618,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
195721,L262616,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"No, no-no-no, I'm sure."
195722,L262615,u5749,m380,LEE,I didn't sleep all night.
195723,L262614,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,Lee... uh...
195724,L262613,u5749,m380,LEE,I almost didn't.
195725,L262612,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,I thought you weren't coming.
195726,L262544,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned."
195727,L262543,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,Your guilt is because you feel the same.
195728,L262542,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!"
195729,L262541,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Yes, but you, you do care about me."
195730,L262540,u5749,m380,LEE,"Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close."
195731,L262539,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out."
195732,L262538,u5749,m380,LEE,"Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?"
195733,L262537,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad."
195734,L262536,u5749,m380,LEE,I can't say anything!
195735,L262535,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?"
195736,L262534,u5749,m380,LEE,Poor Hannah.
195737,L262533,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions."
195738,L262532,u5749,m380,LEE,But not over me?
195739,L262531,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Tch, w-well, for a million reasons."
195740,L262530,u5749,m380,LEE,Why?
195741,L262529,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway."
195742,L262528,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--"
195743,L262527,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you."
195744,L262526,u5749,m380,LEE,"Not because of me, I hope."
195745,L262525,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her."
195746,L262524,u5749,m380,LEE,"Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing."
195747,L262523,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,Hannah and I are in the last stages.
195748,L262522,u5749,m380,LEE,What do you expect me to say?
195749,L262521,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize."
195750,L262520,u5749,m380,LEE,"Why, you know the situation."
195751,L262519,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible."
195752,L262518,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, don't say those words!"
195753,L262517,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you."
195754,L262516,u5749,m380,LEE,"Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?"
195755,L262515,u5741,m380,ELLIOT,"I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up."
195756,L262514,u5749,m380,LEE,I was looking for you.

195933,L263224,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"It's on the table, Dad."
195934,L263223,u5742,m380,EVAN,"I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is."
195935,L262553,u5742,m380,EVAN,"We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman..."
195936,L262552,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?"
195937,L262551,u5742,m380,EVAN,Always.
195938,L262550,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Don't make it worse, Dad."
195939,L262548,u5742,m380,EVAN,I am glad to see you.
195940,L262547,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Hi.  How's she doing?
195941,L261957,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest."
195942,L261956,u5742,m380,EVAN,Yeah.
195943,L261955,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage..."
195944,L261950,u5742,m380,EVAN,"And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!"
195945,L261949,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I am... I did slave all day.
195946,L261940,u5742,m380,EVAN,This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
195947,L261939,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Get his wine away.
195948,L261938,u5742,m380,EVAN,...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
195949,L262889,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Mom, come out!"
195950,L262888,u5743,m380,FATHER,"I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious."
195951,L262886,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, it certainly doesn't look promising."
195952,L262885,u5743,m380,FATHER,How do you know?
195953,L262884,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!"
195954,L262883,u5743,m380,FATHER,Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
195955,L262882,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
195956,L262881,u5743,m380,FATHER,"Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead."
195957,L262880,u5750,m380,MICKEY,That thought doesn't terrify you?
195958,L262879,u5743,m380,FATHER,So?
195959,L262878,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
195960,L262877,u5743,m380,FATHER,Why should I be afraid?
195961,L262874,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision."
195962,L262873,u5743,m380,FATHER,But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
195963,L262872,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try."
195964,L262871,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?"
195965,L262870,u5743,m380,FATHER,But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
195966,L262869,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought."
195967,L262868,u5743,m380,FATHER,How can we be happy?
195968,L262867,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
195969,L262681,u5749,m380,LEE,"Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--"
195970,L262680,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Oh...
195971,L262679,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, God, I don't even know what I want."
195972,L262678,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Jesus...Jesus!
195973,L262677,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late."
195974,L262676,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"You are, you are my only connection to the world!"
195975,L262675,u5749,m380,LEE,It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
195976,L262674,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,But who?  Where did you meet him?
195977,L262673,u5749,m380,LEE,What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
195978,L262672,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Who is it?
195979,L262671,u5749,m380,LEE,"But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!"
195980,L262670,u5749,m380,LEE,Yeah.
195981,L262669,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,So you met somebody else?
195982,L262668,u5749,m380,LEE,I'm saying it now!
195983,L262667,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!"
195984,L262666,u5749,m380,LEE,I'm sorry.
195985,L262665,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!"
195986,L262662,u5749,m380,LEE,Stop accusing me!
195987,L262661,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,You've been with someone!
195988,L262660,u5749,m380,LEE,No.
195989,L262659,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"Oh, yes, you have!"
195990,L262658,u5749,m380,LEE,No.
195991,L262657,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!"
195992,L262656,u5749,m380,LEE,"Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try."
195993,L262655,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?"
195994,L262654,u5749,m380,LEE,"I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while."
195995,L262653,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,What are you going to use for money?!
195996,L262652,u5749,m380,LEE,Because I have to!
195997,L262651,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Why?
195998,L262650,u5749,m380,LEE,"Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out."
195999,L262649,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
196000,L262648,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!"
196001,L262647,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Like what?
196002,L262645,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world."
196003,L262644,u5749,m380,LEE,"I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not."
196004,L262643,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
196005,L262642,u5749,m380,LEE,I can't take this anymore.
196006,L262641,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"You know, you've been very nervous lately."
196007,L262635,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
196008,L262634,u5749,m380,LEE,"Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten."
196009,L262501,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!"
196010,L262500,u5749,m380,LEE,What's the problem?
196011,L262459,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, Frederick!"
196012,L262458,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,I don't sell my work by the yard!
196013,L262453,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,They're in the basement.
196014,L262452,u5749,m380,LEE,"Big.  Frederick, show him the oils."
196015,L261989,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent."
196016,L261988,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,...or films you must see or...
196017,L261986,u5749,m380,LEE,Based on what?  You never even see him.
196018,L261985,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Elliot lusts after you.
196019,L261984,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Yeah.
196020,L261983,u5749,m380,LEE,Me?
196021,L261982,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Because he likes you.
196022,L261981,u5749,m380,LEE,Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
196023,L261978,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
196024,L261977,u5749,m380,LEE,Mm-hm.
196025,L261976,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music."
196026,L261975,u5749,m380,LEE,...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
196027,L261974,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Hmm?
196028,L261973,u5749,m380,LEE,Mmm...
196029,L261972,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Isn't it enough that I can love you?
196030,L261970,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with.
196031,L261969,u5749,m380,LEE,You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
196032,L261968,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
196033,L261967,u5749,m380,LEE,God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
196034,L261966,u5749,m380,LEE,"Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?"
196035,L261965,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,Absolutely.
196036,L261964,u5749,m380,LEE,Are you sure?
196037,L261963,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"No, nothing."
196038,L261962,u5749,m380,LEE,How about something to eat?
196039,L261961,u5744,m380,FREDERICK,"No, thank you."
196040,L261960,u5749,m380,LEE,Want some coffee or tea?
196041,L262611,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic."
196042,L262610,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?"
196043,L262609,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap."
196044,L262608,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Yes!
196045,L262607,u5745,m380,GAIL,"I know, I know, and your hamster."
196046,L262606,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!"
196047,L262605,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything..."
196048,L262604,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us."
196049,L262603,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath."
196050,L262602,u5745,m380,GAIL,No.
196051,L262601,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"A week ago, I bought a rifle."
196052,L262600,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Yes, please."
196053,L262599,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
196054,L262598,u5745,m380,GAIL,Yeah.  What?
196055,L262596,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind..."
196056,L262595,u5745,m380,GAIL,You're just realizing this now?
196057,L262594,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position."
196058,L262593,u5745,m380,GAIL,Yeah...but you're not dying!
196059,L262592,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless."
196060,L262591,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating."
196061,L262590,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
196062,L262168,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy."
196063,L262167,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious..."
196064,L262164,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
196065,L262163,u5745,m380,GAIL,It was on your shirt!
196066,L262162,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!"
196067,L262161,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma."
196068,L262160,u5750,m380,MICKEY,You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
196069,L262159,u5745,m380,GAIL,But you don't have any symptoms!
196070,L262158,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
196071,L262157,u5745,m380,GAIL,"I don't know.  Cancer, I--"
196072,L262156,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Like what?!  What?
196073,L262155,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Well, he has to rule out certain things."
196074,L262154,u5750,m380,MICKEY,If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
196075,L262153,u5745,m380,GAIL,But there's nothing wrong with you.
196076,L262152,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I can't keep my mind on the show.
196077,L262151,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!"
196078,L262150,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?"
196079,L262149,u5745,m380,GAIL,But not you.
196080,L262148,u5745,m380,GAIL,"You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em."
196081,L262145,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Like--
196082,L262144,u5745,m380,GAIL,Hello?
196083,L262143,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"N-n-no, not that."
196084,L262041,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes."
196085,L262040,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Oh, Jesus!"
196086,L262038,u5745,m380,GAIL,Yeah?
196087,L262037,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Look at this guy.
196088,L262034,u5750,m380,MICKEY,No--
196089,L262033,u5745,m380,GAIL,"In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?"
196090,L262032,u5750,m380,MICKEY,You know...
196091,L262031,u5745,m380,GAIL,"Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen."
196092,L263228,u5749,m380,LEE,Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
196093,L263227,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"I know, she...she really writes good dialogue."
196094,L263226,u5749,m380,LEE,"Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed."
196095,L262981,u5749,m380,LEE,I think we need to eat.
196096,L262980,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Yeah?
196097,L262979,u5749,m380,LEE,"I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache."
196098,L262978,u5746,m380,HANNAH,What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
196099,L262969,u5749,m380,LEE,She's going through a really rough time right now.
196100,L262968,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, now--"
196101,L262967,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!"
196102,L262955,u5749,m380,LEE,"You are, Holly.  Stop it."
196103,L262954,u5746,m380,HANNAH,What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
196104,L262919,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that."
196105,L262918,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but..."
196106,L262917,u5749,m380,LEE,Like what?
196107,L262916,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions."
196108,L262915,u5749,m380,LEE,Oh...
196109,L262914,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
196110,L262913,u5749,m380,LEE,Really?
196111,L262912,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months."
196112,L262911,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Y-yeah.
196113,L262910,u5749,m380,LEE,"You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot."
196114,L262909,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I'm okay.
196115,L262908,u5749,m380,LEE,How are you?
196116,L262907,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--"
196117,L262906,u5749,m380,LEE,No.
196118,L262905,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Do you miss Frederick?
196119,L262904,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, me, I'm okay."
196120,L262903,u5746,m380,HANNAH,So how are you?
196121,L262902,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all."
196122,L262901,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive."
196123,L262900,u5749,m380,LEE,Why?
196124,L262899,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I hope you tell her it was your idea...
196125,L262897,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?"
196126,L262896,u5749,m380,LEE,Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
196127,L262895,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Hi.  Where's Holly?
196128,L261926,u5749,m380,LEE,"He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test."
196129,L261925,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, yeah?"
196130,L261922,u5749,m380,LEE,I bumped into your...
196131,L261921,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Doesn't she look pretty?
196132,L261920,u5749,m380,LEE,Come on.
196133,L261919,u5746,m380,HANNAH,You look so beautiful.
196134,L261918,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, great."
196135,L261859,u5749,m380,LEE,Okay.
196136,L261858,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere."
196137,L261837,u5746,m380,HANNAH,You've outdone yourself.
196138,L261836,u5749,m380,LEE,I think they're fantastic.
196139,L261835,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?"
196140,L262421,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and..."
196141,L262420,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that."
196142,L262418,u5746,m380,HANNAH,W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
196143,L262417,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
196144,L262398,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
196145,L262397,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"With a, with a stranger?  With a--"
196146,L262396,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I want to experience childbirth.
196147,L262395,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
196148,L262394,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen."
196149,L262393,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"What, by a st-stranger?"
196150,L262392,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor."
196151,L262391,u5750,m380,MICKEY,What are you talking about?
196152,L262390,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Well, what about artificial insemination?"
196153,L262389,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--"
196154,L262388,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!"
196155,L262387,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
196156,L262386,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?"
196157,L262385,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
196158,L262384,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
196159,L262381,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, then a third opinion."
196160,L262380,u5746,m380,HANNAH,This is the second opinion.
196161,L262375,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Is there no chance?
196162,L262374,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Gee.
196163,L262092,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this."
196164,L262091,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Wow!
196165,L262090,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
196166,L262089,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Football!
196167,L262088,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Go right over there.
196168,L262087,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Oh!
196169,L262086,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Isn't that great?
196170,L262085,u5746,m380,HANNAH,That's a beauty!
196171,L262084,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Mh-hm.
196172,L262083,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Thanks, thanks."
196173,L262082,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"You've always had good taste in husbands, so..."
196174,L262081,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"You know, he's been wanting a mitt."
196175,L262080,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"...you know?  I, uh..."
196176,L262079,u5746,m380,HANNAH,That's really nice!
196177,L262078,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person..."
196178,L262077,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"I know, I know."
196179,L262076,u5750,m380,MICKEY,H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
196180,L262075,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Ohh!
196181,L262072,u5750,m380,MICKEY,The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?
196182,L262071,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Yeah.
196183,L262070,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
196184,L262069,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I think so.
196185,L262068,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think."
196186,L262067,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I think he'll find that satisfying.
196187,L262066,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Oh!
196188,L262065,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play."
196189,L262064,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Yeah?
196190,L262063,u5746,m380,HANNAH,He's fine.
196191,L262062,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
196192,L262061,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Here, you guys.  Open them up."
196193,L262060,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now."
196194,L262059,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
196195,L262058,u5750,m380,MICKEY,How is everything?
196196,L262057,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?"
196197,L262056,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Huh?
196198,L262055,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yeah, aren't you like, you know..."
196199,L262052,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you."
196200,L262051,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--"
196201,L262049,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Very good.
196202,L262048,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I got two minutes.
196203,L262047,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Glad you could put in an appearance.
196204,L262046,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I know...I know.
196205,L262045,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Hi!  Hi!
196206,L262581,u5751,m380,NORMA,I'd have been a great dope addict.
196207,L262580,u5746,m380,HANNAH,True.
196208,L262579,u5751,m380,NORMA,"No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me."
196209,L262578,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Now, Holly's not shy."
196210,L262577,u5751,m380,NORMA,"Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage."
196211,L262576,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things."
196212,L262571,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!"
196213,L262570,u5751,m380,NORMA,"Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test."
196214,L262569,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Okay, okay."
196215,L262568,u5751,m380,NORMA,He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
196216,L262567,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Okay, stop being so dramatic."
196217,L262566,u5751,m380,NORMA,"The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!"
196218,L262565,u5746,m380,HANNAH,You promised to stay on the wagon.
196219,L262564,u5751,m380,NORMA,"No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart."
196220,L262563,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting."
196221,L261944,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"...from Mavis, also."
196222,L261943,u5751,m380,NORMA,Hey!
196223,L263037,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry."
196224,L263036,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
196225,L263035,u5747,m380,HOLLY,That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
196226,L263034,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
196227,L263033,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Well, why don't you share them with us?"
196228,L263032,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!"
196229,L263031,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
196230,L263030,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong."
196231,L263029,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"You're grateful, but you resent me."
196232,L263028,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. ""You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."""
196233,L263027,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?"
196234,L263026,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Wow, I guess I hit a nerve."
196235,L263021,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?"
196236,L263020,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Well--
196237,L263019,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"No, not ""Oh, so loosely""!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?"
196238,L263018,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, so loosely."
196239,L263017,u5746,m380,HANNAH,It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
196240,L263016,u5747,m380,HOLLY,My script?
196241,L263015,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I'm real upset about what you wrote.
196242,L263014,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Hey, what's the matter?"
196243,L262977,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play."
196244,L262976,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Good.
196245,L262975,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
196246,L262974,u5747,m380,HOLLY,What's the matter?
196247,L262973,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
196248,L262972,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?"
196249,L262966,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre."
196250,L262965,u5746,m380,HANNAH,You're crazy!  That's not true.
196251,L262964,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!"
196252,L262963,u5746,m380,HANNAH,You're too demanding.
196253,L262962,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Uh, losers!  All losers!"
196254,L262961,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
196255,L262960,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Hmm!
196256,L262959,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice."
196257,L262958,u5747,m380,HOLLY,You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
196258,L262957,u5746,m380,HANNAH,How?
196259,L262956,u5747,m380,HOLLY,You treat me like a loser.
196260,L262949,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, you mean not at my age."
196261,L262948,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, ""Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer.""  I mean--"
196262,L262947,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging."
196263,L262946,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things."
196264,L262945,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, that's clerical."
196265,L262944,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?"
196266,L262943,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Well-well, like what?"
196267,L262942,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively..."
196268,L262940,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even."
196269,L262939,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Well, that...th-that's fine."
196270,L262938,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money."
196271,L262937,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, God..."
196272,L262932,u5747,m380,HOLLY,You got it.
196273,L262931,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, gosh."
196274,L262928,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, what do they know?"
196275,L262927,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means."
196276,L262926,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Boy--
196277,L262925,u5747,m380,HOLLY,So what's new?
196278,L262924,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Awwww...
196279,L262921,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Well, I just came from an audition..."
196280,L262920,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Hey, hi!"
196281,L262831,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Look, everything's going your way."
196282,L262830,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
196283,L262828,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!"
196284,L262827,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?"
196285,L262826,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Boy, you really know how to cut me down."
196286,L262825,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I hope.
196287,L262824,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it."
196288,L262823,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?"
196289,L262822,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah.
196290,L262821,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take..."
196291,L262820,u5747,m380,HOLLY,W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
196292,L262819,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Easily.
196293,L262818,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Uh-huh.
196294,L262817,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song."
196295,L262816,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that."
196296,L262815,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--"
196297,L262814,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"I know, no--  I know."
196298,L262813,u5747,m380,HOLLY,You know.
196299,L262812,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Ohh!
196300,L262810,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing."
196301,L262809,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?"
196302,L262808,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung."
196303,L262807,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh..."
196304,L262806,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Really?
196305,L262805,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, can you believe it?"
196306,L262804,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Singing?
196307,L262803,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it."
196308,L262802,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?"
196309,L262801,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"You found all this, all this out on one date?"
196310,L262800,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so..."
196311,L262799,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Oh?
196312,L262798,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean..."
196313,L262797,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Oooo.
196314,L262796,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Sometimes she's terrific...
196315,L262795,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic."
196316,L262794,u5747,m380,HOLLY,He's married...
196317,L262791,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, yeah."
196318,L262790,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you."
196319,L262789,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Well, how about this?"
196320,L262788,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all."
196321,L261901,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Oh!
196322,L261900,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Ouch!
196323,L261899,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's."
196324,L261898,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Here.  Be careful with those.
196325,L261897,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Not this Thanksgiving, you know."
196326,L261875,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything."
196327,L261874,u5746,m380,HANNAH,He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
196328,L261873,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, he's such a loser!"
196329,L261872,u5746,m380,HANNAH,He's not a loser at all!
196330,L261871,u5747,m380,HOLLY,He's such a loser!
196331,L261870,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"It's, uh, you never know--"
196332,L261869,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, Hannah!"
196333,L261865,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, your kids are so adorable."
196334,L261864,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!"
196335,L261862,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
196336,L261861,u5746,m380,HANNAH,When does Frederick ever come with her?
196337,L261860,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Frederick didn't come with her.
196338,L261854,u5747,m380,HOLLY,I should get a garter belt.
196339,L261853,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around."
196340,L261850,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"She really does, though."
196341,L261849,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Don't you think she does?
196342,L261847,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah.
196343,L261846,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
196344,L261841,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Uh-oh.
196345,L261840,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Ohh?
196346,L261831,u5747,m380,HOLLY,I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
196347,L261830,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Are we talking about cocaine again?
196348,L261829,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Okay.
196349,L261828,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Will you just tell me one thing?
196350,L261827,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding."
196351,L261826,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Yeah.
196352,L261825,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"You admit that we're great cooks, right?"
196353,L261824,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great."
196354,L261823,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Uh-huh.
196355,L261822,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Two thousand dollars.
196356,L261821,u5746,m380,HANNAH,I know.  H-how much do you need?
196357,L261820,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Someday, I'll pay it all back."
196358,L261819,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Holly, please.  Don't insult me."
196359,L261818,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts."
196360,L261817,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?"
196361,L261816,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset."
196362,L261814,u5746,m380,HANNAH,"Oh, sure."
196363,L261813,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
196364,L261808,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties."
196365,L261807,u5746,m380,HANNAH,Perfect!
196366,L261806,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"No, no, we decided!"
196367,L261805,u5746,m380,HANNAH,What?  You're kidding!
196368,L263263,u5747,m380,HOLLY,I'm pregnant.
196369,L263262,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Mmm, what?"
196370,L263261,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Mickey?
196371,L263260,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I don't know how you're gonna top that.
196372,L263259,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Tch.
196373,L263258,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a..."
196374,L263257,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Thanks.
196375,L263256,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Oh.  You look so beautiful.
196376,L263255,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Just a few minutes ago.
196377,L263254,u5750,m380,MICKEY,When'd you get here?
196378,L263253,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Okay.
196379,L263252,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Hi.  How you doin'?
196380,L263251,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Hi.
196381,L263250,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
196382,L263222,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah.
196383,L263221,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?"
196384,L263220,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Sure.  Sure, uh, yes."
196385,L263219,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or..."
196386,L263218,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I--"
196387,L263217,u5747,m380,HOLLY,It's all right.
196388,L263216,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous."
196389,L263215,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself."
196390,L263214,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Oh, yeah?  What?"
196391,L263213,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this."
196392,L263192,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
196393,L263191,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now."
196394,L263190,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!"
196395,L263189,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Oh, who cares?"
196396,L263188,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life."
196397,L263187,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it."
196398,L263186,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh..."
196399,L263185,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff."
196400,L263184,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, wow!"
196401,L263183,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I am.  You-you made my day.
196402,L263182,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, God!"
196403,L263181,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed."
196404,L263180,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Oh!
196405,L263179,u5750,m380,MICKEY,...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
196406,L263178,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Right.
196407,L263177,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but..."
196408,L263176,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?"
196409,L263175,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know..."
196410,L263174,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, it just came to me one day."
196411,L263173,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?"
196412,L263172,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Really?
196413,L263171,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great."
196414,L263170,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think."
196415,L263166,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and..."
196416,L263165,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, well."
196417,L263164,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, what about me?"
196418,L263163,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
196419,L263162,u5750,m380,MICKEY,You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
196420,L263161,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
196421,L263160,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?"
196422,L263159,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it."
196423,L263158,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one."
196424,L263157,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Really?
196425,L263156,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know."
196426,L263155,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote."
196427,L263154,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--"
196428,L263153,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Yeah.
196429,L263152,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh..."
196430,L263151,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Hmm.
196431,L263150,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script."
196432,L263149,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing."
196433,L263148,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion."
196434,L263147,u5750,m380,MICKEY,What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
196435,L263146,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, I'm fine."
196436,L263145,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?"
196437,L263144,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"You're okay, though, huh?"
196438,L263143,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--"
196439,L263142,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Oh.  Oh.
196440,L263141,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year..."
196441,L263140,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I've done no television whatsoever. No.
196442,L263139,u5747,m380,HOLLY,You're kidding me.
196443,L263138,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year."
196444,L263137,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--"
196445,L263136,u5750,m380,MICKEY,You have.
196446,L263135,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"No, I haven't."
196447,L263134,u5750,m380,MICKEY,You've always hated my taste in the past.
196448,L263133,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"No, the reason I ask is--"
196449,L263132,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would."
196450,L263131,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?"
196451,L263130,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Really?
196452,L263129,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Nobody ever said it.
196453,L263128,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, ""Hey, I have something I just wrote,"" right?"
196454,L263127,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"No, I am.  I am."
196455,L263126,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Come on.
196456,L263125,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"No, you can tell me."
196457,L263124,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this."
196458,L263123,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?"
196459,L263122,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah.
196460,L263121,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Have you?
196461,L263120,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"No, well...I've been trying to write."
196462,L263119,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Are you, are you out of work or something?"
196463,L263118,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Probably not.
196464,L263117,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
196465,L263116,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all."
196466,L263115,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Well...
196467,L263114,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, nothing much.  You know..."
196468,L263113,u5750,m380,MICKEY,You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
196469,L263112,u5747,m380,HOLLY,I'm okay.
196470,L263111,u5750,m380,MICKEY,So how are you?
196471,L263110,u5750,m380,MICKEY,...namely a personality.
196472,L263109,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed."
196473,L263108,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired..."
196474,L263107,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, I hope you've changed."
196475,L263106,u5747,m380,HOLLY,People change...you know.
196476,L263105,u5750,m380,MICKEY,You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
196477,L263104,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, well, that was a long time ago."
196478,L263103,u5750,m380,MICKEY,...in a really horrible way.
196479,L263102,u5747,m380,HOLLY,I'd never do that.
196480,L263101,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a..."
196481,L263100,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, it was."
196482,L263099,u5750,m380,MICKEY,It was a terrible evening.
196483,L263098,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah?
196484,L263097,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yeah, really.  You do.  You do."
196485,L263096,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, no."
196486,L263095,u5750,m380,MICKEY,You look wonderful.
196487,L263094,u5747,m380,HOLLY,I'm fine.
196488,L263093,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Good.  How are you?
196489,L263092,u5747,m380,HOLLY,How are you?
196490,L263091,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots."
196491,L263090,u5747,m380,HOLLY,We didn't hit it off.
196492,L263089,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh..."
196493,L263088,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Yeah.
196494,L263087,u5750,m380,MICKEY,I was walking past and I saw you in here...
196495,L263086,u5747,m380,HOLLY,I recall you.
196496,L263085,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yes, you do recall, right?"
196497,L263084,u5747,m380,HOLLY,I remember you.
196498,L263083,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together."
196499,L262744,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials."
196500,L262743,u5747,m380,HOLLY,God!
196501,L262742,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
196502,L262741,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately."
196503,L262740,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yeah.  Me, too."
196504,L262739,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out."
196505,L262738,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really."
196506,L262737,u5747,m380,HOLLY,This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
196507,L262736,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?"
196508,L262735,u5747,m380,HOLLY,At least I'm open to new concepts!
196509,L262734,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!"
196510,L262733,u5747,m380,HOLLY,I was so bored!
196511,L262732,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing."
196512,L262731,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Thanks for a swell time.
196513,L262726,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me."
196514,L262725,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Eh, Mickey, it's getting late."
196515,L262724,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
196516,L262723,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
196517,L262722,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong."
196518,L262721,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
196519,L262720,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?"
196520,L262718,u5750,m380,MICKEY,My--uh...
196521,L262717,u5747,m380,HOLLY,No!
196522,L262716,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Can we, can we go?"
196523,L262715,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please."
196524,L262714,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Come on, Mickey.  Come on."
196525,L262711,u5747,m380,HOLLY,You want some?
196526,L262710,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't..."
196527,L262708,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!"
196528,L262707,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything."
196529,L262706,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Listen, you are witnessing genius!"
196530,L262705,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--"
196531,L262704,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, why are you making those faces?"
196532,L262971,u5749,m380,LEE,"You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating."
196533,L262970,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Why are you so upset?
196534,L262953,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?"
196535,L262952,u5749,m380,LEE,Boy...Holly...Holly.
196536,L262951,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?"
196537,L262950,u5749,m380,LEE,"Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?"
196538,L262936,u5749,m380,LEE,Hmm.
196539,L262935,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe."
196540,L262930,u5749,m380,LEE,April?
196541,L262929,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
196542,L262923,u5747,m380,HOLLY,...which I did not get.
196543,L262922,u5749,m380,LEE,Hi.
196544,L261935,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Dad!
196545,L261934,u5749,m380,LEE,Oh...
196546,L261933,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Dad...
196547,L261857,u5749,m380,LEE,Where are the antihistamines?
196548,L261856,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
196549,L261855,u5749,m380,LEE,Yeah.
196550,L261852,u5747,m380,HOLLY,God.
196551,L261851,u5749,m380,LEE,"Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here."
196552,L261845,u5747,m380,HOLLY,Mm-hm.
196553,L261844,u5749,m380,LEE,At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
196554,L261843,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning."
196555,L261839,u5749,m380,LEE,"I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so..."
196556,L261838,u5747,m380,HOLLY,"Oh, my God.  Thank you."
196557,L262997,u5748,m380,KRISHNA LEADER,You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
196558,L262996,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, okay.  Thank you very much."
196559,L262995,u5748,m380,KRISHNA LEADER,"...read it over, and think about it."
196560,L262994,u5750,m380,MICKEY,Uh-huh.
196561,L262993,u5748,m380,KRISHNA LEADER,Take our literature...
196562,L262992,u5748,m380,KRISHNA LEADER,"You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?"
196563,L262991,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--"
196564,L262990,u5748,m380,KRISHNA LEADER,"Yeah, well, what's your religion?"
196565,L262989,u5750,m380,MICKEY,"Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me."
196566,L262988,u5748,m380,KRISHNA LEADER,What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
196567,L265441,u5753,m381,ANNA,I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
196568,L265440,u5768,m381,PAZZI,Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
196569,L265439,u5753,m381,ANNA,...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
196570,L265438,u5768,m381,PAZZI,I <u>swear</u> to you...

196572,L265436,u5768,m381,PAZZI,...I was <u>working</u>...
196573,L265435,u5753,m381,ANNA,"You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>..."
196574,L265434,u5768,m381,PAZZI,"<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?"
196575,L265433,u5753,m381,ANNA,...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
196576,L265432,u5768,m381,PAZZI,They're offering...
196577,L265431,u5753,m381,ANNA,And?
196578,L265430,u5768,m381,PAZZI,Some museum director disappeared.
196579,L265429,u5753,m381,ANNA,A reward for what?
196580,L265428,u5768,m381,PAZZI,I'm going to tell you later....
196581,L265427,u5753,m381,ANNA,A reward...
196582,L265426,u5768,m381,PAZZI,"I'm on the track of a reward, which..."
196583,L265425,u5753,m381,ANNA,We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
196584,L265424,u5768,m381,PAZZI,...you don't have to think.
196585,L265423,u5753,m381,ANNA,I can't think.
196586,L265420,u5753,m381,ANNA,Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
196587,L265419,u5768,m381,PAZZI,Aren't you glad to see me?
196588,L265634,u5754,m381,BARNEY,And have <u>you</u> found Peace..?
196589,L265633,u5771,m381,STARLING,"Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken."
196590,L265632,u5754,m381,BARNEY,"Oh, yes.  He's found Peace."
196591,L265631,u5771,m381,STARLING,"No, you're wrong about Verger."
196592,L265630,u5754,m381,BARNEY,"Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?"
196593,L265629,u5771,m381,STARLING,Who would that be.
196594,L265628,u5754,m381,BARNEY,Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
196595,L265627,u5771,m381,STARLING,And why is it a vacant exercise?
196596,L265626,u5754,m381,BARNEY,"Rich, comic book freaks."
196597,L265625,u5771,m381,STARLING,<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
196598,L265623,u5754,m381,BARNEY,"Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif..."
196599,L265622,u5771,m381,STARLING,...they did it for a lark.
196600,L265621,u5754,m381,BARNEY,...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
196601,L265620,u5771,m381,STARLING,"Let's keep it to business, shall we?"
196602,L265619,u5754,m381,BARNEY,"You said ""here's what <u>they</u> want you to do.""  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?"
196603,L265616,u5754,m381,BARNEY,I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
196604,L265615,u5771,m381,STARLING,You want me to be?
196605,L265614,u5754,m381,BARNEY,...aren't you afraid of me...?
196606,L265613,u5771,m381,STARLING,<u>That's</u> the spirit...
196607,L265612,u5754,m381,BARNEY,"There's one or two freaks, and, for a ""<u>Pass</u>,"" I'll rat them out to you..."
196608,L265611,u5771,m381,STARLING,Then who's buying it?
196609,L265610,u5754,m381,BARNEY,"Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his ""mind,"" do you see...?"
196610,L265609,u5771,m381,STARLING,Say it in English.
196611,L265608,u5754,m381,BARNEY,We could skip the Gavotte.
196612,L265607,u5771,m381,STARLING,"Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income."
196613,L265606,u5754,m381,BARNEY,That would adversely impact my income.
196614,L265605,u5771,m381,STARLING,"Now, whyn't you help us?"
196615,L265604,u5754,m381,BARNEY,"You said ""here's what <u>they</u> want you to do...""  Why?"
196616,L265603,u5771,m381,STARLING,Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
196617,L265602,u5754,m381,BARNEY,...why?
196618,L265601,u5771,m381,STARLING,Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
196619,L265600,u5754,m381,BARNEY,...very good.
196620,L265599,u5771,m381,STARLING,"Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?"
196621,L265598,u5754,m381,BARNEY,Why me?

197469,L271328,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice...."
197470,L271327,u5788,m383,BRAD,Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
197471,L271326,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Hey really, I don't feel so great."
197472,L271325,u5788,m383,BRAD,"How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>."
197473,L271321,u5788,m383,BRAD,"Hey, don't run away now."
197474,L271320,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?"
197475,L271319,u5788,m383,BRAD,Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
197476,L271318,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
197477,L271309,u5788,m383,BRAD,"It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask ""What's your major?"" I hate that."
197478,L271308,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Gee, thanks."
197479,L271307,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one."
197480,L271306,u5788,m383,BRAD,"So, are you a cheerleader?"
197481,L271561,u5789,m383,COURTNEY,You did last night.
197482,L271560,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I'm sorry? I don't get it.
197483,L271559,u5789,m383,COURTNEY,"Like last night, Veronica?"
197484,L271558,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
197485,L271474,u5800,m383,VERONICA,What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
197486,L271473,u5789,m383,COURTNEY,"In my heart, Heather's still alive."
197487,L271472,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Oh, I have to hear this."
197488,L271156,u5800,m383,VERONICA,You're beautiful.
197489,L271155,u5789,m383,COURTNEY,"If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent."
197490,L271803,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep."
197491,L271802,u5790,m383,DAD,"Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?"
197492,L271499,u5790,m383,DAD,"Oh yeah, that's it."
197493,L271498,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Because you're an idiot.
197494,L271497,u5790,m383,DAD,Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
197495,L271494,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"I don't know, it was okay, I guess."
197496,L271493,u5790,m383,DAD,So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
197497,L271492,u5800,m383,VERONICA,All right.
197498,L271276,u5790,m383,DAD,"Oh yeah, that's it."
197499,L271275,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Because you're an idiot.
197500,L271274,u5790,m383,DAD,Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
197501,L271269,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"I don't know, it was okay, I guess."
197502,L271268,u5790,m383,DAD,So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
197503,L271267,u5800,m383,VERONICA,All right.
197504,L271266,u5790,m383,DAD,"Take a break Veronica, sit down."
197505,L271731,u5791,m383,EARL,Uh-huh.
197506,L271730,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Things are going to change, Earl."
197507,L271729,u5791,m383,EARL,"I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile."
197508,L271728,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
197509,L271727,u5791,m383,EARL,"Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd."
197510,L271726,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Something like that. Will you do it?
197511,L271725,u5791,m383,EARL,"Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is."
197512,L271903,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
197513,L271902,u5800,m383,VERONICA,What are you doing here?!
197514,L271901,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing ""Kumbaya"" one more time..."
197515,L271900,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Heather? Wha...
197516,L271899,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
197517,L271389,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
197518,L271388,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night."
197519,L271387,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
197520,L271339,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games."
197521,L271338,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up."
197522,L271337,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!"
197523,L271336,u5800,m383,VERONICA,You goddamn bitch!
197524,L271335,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,You stupid cunt!
197525,L271333,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,No. Hell no.
197526,L271332,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?"
197527,L271331,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
197528,L271261,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
197529,L271260,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
197530,L271244,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Never say never.
197531,L271243,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
197532,L271213,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Geez, don't listen to them."
197533,L271212,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
197534,L271202,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
197535,L271201,u5800,m383,VERONICA,We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
197536,L271200,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day."
197537,L271199,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
197538,L271198,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing."
197539,L271195,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?"
197540,L271194,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
197541,L271193,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest."
197542,L271168,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
197543,L271167,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
197544,L271166,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior."
197545,L271165,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
197546,L271162,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad."
197547,L271161,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?"
197548,L271160,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,If you're going to openly be a bitch....
197549,L271146,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
197550,L271145,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I was talking with someone!
197551,L271138,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks."
197552,L271137,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......"
197553,L271133,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
197554,L271132,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Sawyer. Guess what today is?
197555,L271120,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Don't think.
197556,L271119,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I'll think about it.
197557,L271118,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks."
197558,L271117,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock."
197559,L271116,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
197560,L271259,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
197561,L271258,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
197562,L271252,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram ""Wham-bam- thank-you-maam"" Sweeney."
197563,L271251,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,King David.
197564,L271250,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David."
197565,L271241,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
197566,L271240,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,"God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something."
197567,L271209,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,Color me nauseous.
197568,L271208,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86."
197569,L271204,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,"Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm."
197570,L271203,u5792,m383,HEATHER CHANDLER,"Ku-urt, let's pa-arty."
197571,L271854,u5795,m383,J.D.,Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
197572,L271853,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
197573,L271723,u5795,m383,J.D.,Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
197574,L271722,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,Very very. The photographs?
197575,L271721,u5795,m383,J.D.,"I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself."
197576,L271720,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,But she couldn't handle it.
197577,L271719,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but..."
197578,L271718,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,What do you want from me?
197579,L271717,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?"
197580,L271716,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,Where did you get these?
197581,L271957,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town."
197582,L271956,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,What are you doing?
197583,L271955,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Yeah, I just got back."
197584,L271954,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"Veronica, you look like hell."
197585,L271867,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!"
197586,L271866,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?"
197587,L271865,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,Jealous much?
197588,L271864,u5800,m383,VERONICA,No.
197589,L271863,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
197590,L271862,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Don't talk to me like that.
197591,L271861,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"So some people need different kinds of ""convincing"" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!"
197592,L271860,u5800,m383,VERONICA,People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
197593,L271859,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!"
197594,L271825,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"Oh shit, yeah."
197595,L271824,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
197596,L271823,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
197597,L271822,u5800,m383,VERONICA,You're not funny. Ouch!
197598,L271821,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers."
197599,L271820,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I said I was sorry.
197600,L271819,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?"
197601,L271818,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Is she dead?
197602,L271817,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car."
197603,L271733,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Heather.
197604,L271732,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,Guess who?
197605,L271684,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
197606,L271683,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,Don't worry. We'll work something out.
197607,L271216,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed."
197608,L271215,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense."
197609,L271211,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"Yeah, maybe."
197610,L271210,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Maybe you should see a doctor.
197611,L271114,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus..."
197612,L271113,u5793,m383,HEATHER DUKE,"Yeah, she really wants to talk to you."
197613,L271851,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Sure.
197614,L271850,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
197615,L271849,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host."
197616,L271848,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,Probably....
197617,L271847,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?"
197618,L271846,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
197619,L271845,u5800,m383,VERONICA,You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
197620,L271844,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,Suicide is a private thing.
197621,L271843,u5800,m383,VERONICA,What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
197622,L271760,u5800,m383,VERONICA,So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
197623,L271759,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,Shit.
197624,L271514,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,"Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it."
197625,L271513,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D."
197626,L271512,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,"Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date."
197627,L271511,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
197628,L271510,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
197629,L271462,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Uh-huh.
197630,L271461,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,"That was seriously warped, Veronica."
197631,L271444,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,"Yeah, where's your urge to purge?"
197632,L271443,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food."
197633,L271255,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Give it up girl!
197634,L271254,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,"No way, no day!"
197635,L271218,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Give me the clipboard.
197636,L271217,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,"God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History."
197637,L271131,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent."
197638,L271130,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,"God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?"
197639,L271112,u5794,m383,HEATHER MCNAMARA,"God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather."
197640,L271111,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my..."
197641,L271951,u5795,m383,J.D.,"You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean."
197642,L271950,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I thought I...you..
197643,L271949,u5795,m383,J.D.,"You really fucked me up, Veronica."
197644,L271945,u5795,m383,J.D.,What?
197645,L271944,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"You know what I want, babe?"
197646,L271943,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?"
197647,L271942,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"The bomb, asshole!"
197648,L271941,u5795,m383,J.D.,"You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge."
197649,L271940,u5800,m383,VERONICA,How do you turn the fucker off?
197650,L271939,u5795,m383,J.D.,"You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven."
197651,L271938,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it."
197652,L271932,u5795,m383,J.D.,You didn't say Simon Says.
197653,L271931,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head."
197654,L271930,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground."
197655,L271929,u5795,m383,J.D.,"I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!"
197656,L271895,u5800,m383,VERONICA,No-o!
197657,L271894,u5795,m383,J.D.,If you'll excuse me......
197658,L271892,u5795,m383,J.D.,"You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?"
197659,L271891,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note."
197660,L271889,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless."
197661,L271888,u5795,m383,J.D.,What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
197662,L271887,u5800,m383,VERONICA,This knife is filthy.
197663,L271886,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag."
197664,L271885,u5800,m383,VERONICA,You're still not listening! I'm not..
197665,L271884,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
197666,L271883,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious..."
197667,L271882,u5795,m383,J.D.,"""You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!"
197668,L271881,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!"
197669,L271873,u5795,m383,J.D.,"I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!"
197670,L271872,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"It's over, J.D.  Over!"
197671,L271871,u5795,m383,J.D.,"I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?"
197672,L271870,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
197673,L271869,u5795,m383,J.D.,Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
197674,L271714,u5795,m383,J.D.,Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
197675,L271713,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
197676,L271712,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you."
197677,L271711,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you."
197678,L271710,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor."
197679,L271709,u5800,m383,VERONICA,We're breaking up. I am out!
197680,L271702,u5800,m383,VERONICA,May<u>be</u>.
197681,L271701,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?"
197682,L271700,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
197683,L271691,u5795,m383,J.D.,You kids are making too much damn noise.
197684,L271690,u5800,m383,VERONICA,You can be so immature!
197685,L271688,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
197686,L271687,u5795,m383,J.D.,She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
197687,L271686,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience."
197688,L271678,u5795,m383,J.D.,I was just making it more special.
197689,L271677,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Can't you see this is a special moment?
197690,L271657,u5795,m383,J.D.,How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
197691,L271656,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Your son's dead and you love him.
197692,L271654,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
197693,L271653,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes."
197694,L271649,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Did not.
197695,L271648,u5795,m383,J.D.,Did to.
197696,L271647,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Did not.
197697,L271646,u5795,m383,J.D.,Did to.
197698,L271645,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
197699,L271644,u5795,m383,J.D.,You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
197700,L271642,u5795,m383,J.D.,Of course.
197701,L271641,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"We killed them, didn't we?"
197702,L271622,u5795,m383,J.D.,Remember he's left-handed.
197703,L271621,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Kurt doesn't look too good.
197704,L271617,u5795,m383,J.D.,Don't move! I'll get him back!
197705,L271616,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on...."
197706,L271615,u5795,m383,J.D.,Did you miss him completely?
197707,L271598,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?"
197708,L271597,u5795,m383,J.D.,This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
197709,L271596,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
197710,L271595,u5795,m383,J.D.,Perrier water!
197711,L271594,u5795,m383,J.D.,"You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up..."
197712,L271593,u5800,m383,VERONICA,You must have had fun.
197713,L271592,u5795,m383,J.D.,"We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick."
197714,L271591,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed."
197715,L271590,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Oh.
197716,L271589,u5795,m383,J.D.,It doesn't work on small animals!
197717,L271588,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
197718,L271587,u5795,m383,J.D.,"They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce."
197719,L271586,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play."
197720,L271585,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word."
197721,L271584,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
197722,L271583,u5795,m383,J.D.,Incredible similarity.
197723,L271582,u5800,m383,VERONICA,First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
197724,L271580,u5800,m383,VERONICA,So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
197725,L271579,u5795,m383,J.D.,"These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm."
197726,L271578,u5800,m383,VERONICA,French.
197727,L271577,u5795,m383,J.D.,Do you take German?
197728,L271576,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over."
197729,L271575,u5795,m383,J.D.,Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
197730,L271574,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
197731,L271547,u5795,m383,J.D.,Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
197732,L271546,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!"
197733,L271543,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
197734,L271542,u5795,m383,J.D.,What is this shit?
197735,L271488,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?"
197736,L271487,u5800,m383,VERONICA,My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
197737,L271486,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner."
197738,L271476,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Yeah. Scary stuff.
197739,L271475,u5795,m383,J.D.,Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
197740,L271470,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Next channel, darling."
197741,L271469,u5795,m383,J.D.,Mute!
197742,L271416,u5800,m383,VERONICA,That's good. Have you done this before?
197743,L271415,u5795,m383,J.D.,"""I die knowing no one knew the real me."""
197744,L271414,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"You're probably right...""People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."""
197745,L271413,u5795,m383,J.D.,That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
197746,L271412,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"She missed ""myriad"" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?"
197747,L271411,u5795,m383,J.D.,This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
197748,L271410,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"That's good, but Heather would never use the word ""myriad."""
197749,L271409,u5795,m383,J.D.,"""To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."""
197750,L271408,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"""You might think what I've done is shocking..."""
197751,L271407,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
197752,L271406,u5795,m383,J.D.,Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
197753,L271405,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Like a suicide thing?
197754,L271404,u5795,m383,J.D.,"We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing....."
197755,L271403,u5800,m383,VERONICA,It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
197756,L271402,u5795,m383,J.D.,"I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know."
197757,L271401,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
197758,L271400,u5795,m383,J.D.,"What are we going to tell the cops? ""Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."""
197759,L271399,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna..."
197760,L271398,u5795,m383,J.D.,And your worst enemy.
197761,L271397,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend."
197762,L271396,u5795,m383,J.D.,Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
197763,L271383,u5800,m383,VERONICA,You're not funny.
197764,L271382,u5795,m383,J.D.,Chick-en.
197765,L271381,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely."
197766,L271380,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Yeah, great."
197767,L271379,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
197768,L271377,u5795,m383,J.D.,Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
197769,L271376,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that."
197770,L271375,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue."
197771,L271374,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?"
197772,L271373,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
197773,L271372,u5795,m383,J.D.,"I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself."
197774,L271370,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue."
197775,L271369,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
197776,L271364,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out."
197777,L271363,u5795,m383,J.D.,Good plan.
197778,L271362,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die."
197779,L271361,u5795,m383,J.D.,I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
197780,L271360,u5800,m383,VERONICA,There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
197781,L271359,u5795,m383,J.D.,Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
197782,L271358,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky."
197783,L271357,u5795,m383,J.D.,"See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby."
197784,L271356,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Well then, I'll pray for rain."
197785,L271355,u5795,m383,J.D.,"A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift."
197786,L271354,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Killing her won't solve anything.
197787,L271353,u5795,m383,J.D.,Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
197788,L271352,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
197789,L271348,u5800,m383,VERONICA,You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
197790,L271347,u5795,m383,J.D.,"That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you."
197791,L271342,u5795,m383,J.D.,I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
197792,L271341,u5800,m383,VERONICA,S'okay....
197793,L271340,u5795,m383,J.D.,Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
197794,L271296,u5795,m383,J.D.,Maybe it's time for a vacation.
197795,L271295,u5800,m383,VERONICA,It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
197796,L271294,u5795,m383,J.D.,I don't really like your friends either.
197797,L271293,u5800,m383,VERONICA,It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
197798,L271292,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University."
197799,L271291,u5795,m383,J.D.,Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
197800,L271290,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
197801,L271289,u5795,m383,J.D.,"My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? ""Bringing every State to a Higher State."""
197802,L271288,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I don't know. Should you?
197803,L271287,u5795,m383,J.D.,Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
197804,L271285,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I didn't. Cherry.
197805,L271284,u5795,m383,J.D.,"The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?"
197806,L271283,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
197807,L271282,u5795,m383,J.D.,"I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane."
197808,L271281,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well."
197809,L271280,u5795,m383,J.D.,You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
197810,L271230,u5800,m383,VERONICA,How very.
197811,L271229,u5795,m383,J.D.,"Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach."
197812,L271224,u5795,m383,J.D.,That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
197813,L271223,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?"
197814,L271222,u5795,m383,J.D.,There are no stupid questions.
197815,L271601,u5799,m383,RAM,"Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!"
197816,L271600,u5796,m383,KURT,"Shut the fuck up, all right."
197817,L271599,u5799,m383,RAM,Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
197818,L271537,u5799,m383,RAM,Punch it in!
197819,L271536,u5796,m383,KURT,"Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest."
197820,L271535,u5799,m383,RAM,"I think so, man."
197821,L271534,u5796,m383,KURT,"Is it sleeping, dude?"
197822,L271521,u5799,m383,RAM,Goddamn Geek!
197823,L271520,u5796,m383,KURT,"Cool off, we're seniors."
197824,L271519,u5799,m383,RAM,Let's kick his ass.
197825,L271518,u5796,m383,KURT,That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
197826,L271517,u5796,m383,KURT,Pretty weird.
197827,L271516,u5799,m383,RAM,"I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?"
197828,L271515,u5796,m383,KURT,We on tonight man?
197829,L271236,u5796,m383,KURT,"Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?"
197830,L271235,u5799,m383,RAM,Answer him dick!
197831,L271234,u5796,m383,KURT,"What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?"
197832,L271233,u5799,m383,RAM,You going to eat this?
197833,L271228,u5796,m383,KURT,"Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though."
197834,L271227,u5799,m383,RAM,Let's kick his ass.
197835,L271226,u5796,m383,KURT,Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
197836,L271225,u5799,m383,RAM,Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
197837,L271812,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized."
197838,L271811,u5797,m383,MOM,"I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?"
197839,L271810,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
197840,L271807,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life."
197841,L271806,u5797,m383,MOM,Turn that back on!
197842,L271659,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Superb.
197843,L271658,u5797,m383,MOM,How was the funeral?
197844,L271501,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow."
197845,L271500,u5797,m383,MOM,You two....
197846,L271496,u5800,m383,VERONICA,May<u>be</u>.
197847,L271495,u5797,m383,MOM,Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
197848,L271278,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight."
197849,L271277,u5797,m383,MOM,You two....
197850,L271273,u5800,m383,VERONICA,May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
197851,L271272,u5797,m383,MOM,Any contestants worth mentioning?
197852,L271271,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I guess.
197853,L271270,u5797,m383,MOM,"Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?"
197854,L271921,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Get a job.
197855,L271920,u5798,m383,PAULINE,We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
197856,L271919,u5800,m383,VERONICA,Where is he? Where's J.D.?
197857,L271918,u5798,m383,PAULINE,Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
197858,L271790,u5798,m383,PAULINE,"What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?"
197859,L271789,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right."
197860,L271788,u5798,m383,PAULINE,Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
197861,L271439,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness."
197862,L271438,u5798,m383,PAULINE,"Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share."
197863,L271787,u5801,m383,WHITNEY JAMES,Sure. Ciao.
197864,L271786,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up."
197865,L271785,u5801,m383,WHITNEY JAMES,"Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda."
197866,L271784,u5800,m383,VERONICA,"The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness."
197867,L271781,u5801,m383,WHITNEY JAMES,"Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up."
197868,L271780,u5800,m383,VERONICA,I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
197869,L271779,u5801,m383,WHITNEY JAMES,"People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?"
197870,L271778,u5800,m383,VERONICA,But my name's not...
197871,L271777,u5801,m383,WHITNEY JAMES,"I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too."
197872,L271663,u5801,m383,WHITNEY JAMES,"It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary."
197873,L271662,u5800,m383,VERONICA,That's three things.
197874,L271661,u5801,m383,WHITNEY JAMES,"Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert ""Ram"" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope."
197875,L272921,u5802,m384,HERBERT,Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
197876,L272920,u5804,m384,JULIET,"Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based."
197877,L272919,u5802,m384,HERBERT,This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
197878,L272913,u5802,m384,HERBERT,I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
197879,L272912,u5804,m384,JULIET,"Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head."
197880,L272911,u5802,m384,HERBERT,"I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood."
197881,L272910,u5802,m384,HERBERT,"We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?"
197882,L272909,u5804,m384,JULIET,I adore anything to do with the arts.
197883,L272903,u5804,m384,JULIET,I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
197884,L272902,u5802,m384,HERBERT,What's that?
197885,L272901,u5804,m384,JULIET,"Mummy has a special technique called ""Deep Therapy."""
197886,L273282,u5803,m384,HONORA,Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
197887,L273281,u5802,m384,HERBERT,wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
197888,L273278,u5802,m384,HERBERT,"Have a nice outing, you lot."
197889,L273277,u5803,m384,HONORA,Bye.
197890,L273276,u5802,m384,HERBERT,pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
197891,L273275,u5802,m384,HERBERT,"I'd better be getting back. Bye, love."
197892,L273222,u5803,m384,HONORA,breaks down into heavy sobs.
197893,L273221,u5802,m384,HERBERT,accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
197894,L273212,u5803,m384,HONORA,She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
197895,L273211,u5802,m384,HERBERT,What now?
197896,L273210,u5803,m384,HONORA,I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
197897,L273209,u5802,m384,HERBERT,is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
197898,L273109,u5803,m384,HONORA,"Is it hurting, dear?"
197899,L273108,u5802,m384,HERBERT,"waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern."
197900,L273089,u5803,m384,HONORA,frowns at Henry.
197901,L273088,u5802,m384,HERBERT,"No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!"
197902,L273087,u5802,m384,HERBERT,"sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand."
197903,L273086,u5803,m384,HONORA,"Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing."
197904,L272986,u5802,m384,HERBERT,Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
197905,L272985,u5803,m384,HONORA,pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
197906,L272984,u5803,m384,HONORA,I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
197907,L272889,u5803,m384,HONORA,whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
197908,L272888,u5802,m384,HERBERT,Look who I've found!
197909,L272887,u5803,m384,HONORA,"and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery."
197910,L272886,u5802,m384,HERBERT,Come on through.
197911,L272885,u5803,m384,HONORA,Come on! Sausage rolls.
197912,L272809,u5802,m384,HERBERT,sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
197913,L272808,u5803,m384,HONORA,I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
197914,L272807,u5803,m384,HONORA,playfully shoves his hand away.
197915,L272806,u5802,m384,HERBERT,"Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?"
197916,L273298,u5803,m384,HONORA,looks down at the ground in front of her.
197917,L273297,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"Look, Mother!"
197918,L273290,u5803,m384,HONORA,"Oh, no. I'm watching my figure."
197919,L273289,u5805,m384,PAULINE,You have it.
197920,L273272,u5803,m384,HONORA,"That's enough, Yvonne!"
197921,L273271,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!"
197922,L273197,u5803,m384,HONORA,"Love, you can still write to each other."
197923,L273196,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out."
197924,L273193,u5803,m384,HONORA,stands and walks toward the door.
197925,L273192,u5805,m384,PAULINE,You have to let me go!
197926,L273191,u5803,m384,HONORA,You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
197927,L273190,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
197928,L273189,u5803,m384,HONORA,"Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us."
197929,L273188,u5805,m384,PAULINE,The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
197930,L273168,u5803,m384,HONORA,Open this door!
197931,L273167,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!"
197932,L273128,u5803,m384,HONORA,All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
197933,L273127,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I don't wanna be in bloody school!
197934,L273126,u5803,m384,HONORA,You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
197935,L273125,u5803,m384,HONORA,is very angry.
197936,L273124,u5805,m384,PAULINE,What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
197937,L273123,u5803,m384,HONORA,These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
197938,L273122,u5803,m384,HONORA,snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
197939,L273121,u5803,m384,HONORA,You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
197940,L273120,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I'm educating myself!
197941,L273119,u5803,m384,HONORA,I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
197942,L273118,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Who cares!
197943,L273117,u5803,m384,HONORA,She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
197944,L273116,u5805,m384,PAULINE,What does old Stew want?
197945,L273115,u5803,m384,HONORA,It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
197946,L273114,u5805,m384,PAULINE,My name is Gina!
197947,L273061,u5803,m384,HONORA,steps back.
197948,L273060,u5805,m384,PAULINE,You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
197949,L273059,u5803,m384,HONORA,whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
197950,L273058,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"Well, I guess I take after you then!"
197951,L273057,u5803,m384,HONORA,"My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!"
197952,L273055,u5803,m384,HONORA,grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
197953,L273054,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Can I go now?
197954,L273053,u5803,m384,HONORA,sighs.
197955,L273052,u5803,m384,HONORA,"If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?"
197956,L273051,u5803,m384,HONORA,"From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you."
197957,L273050,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture."
197958,L272982,u5803,m384,HONORA,Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
197959,L272981,u5805,m384,PAULINE,But she'll have no one to look after her!
197960,L272980,u5803,m384,HONORA,Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
197961,L272979,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
197962,L272978,u5803,m384,HONORA,holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
197963,L272977,u5803,m384,HONORA,"You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!"
197964,L272976,u5803,m384,HONORA,starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
197965,L272975,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I just want to be on my own for a while.
197966,L272974,u5803,m384,HONORA,"You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill."
197967,L272973,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I'm not hungry.
197968,L272972,u5803,m384,HONORA,"Come on, sit up."
197969,L272971,u5803,m384,HONORA,"comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast."
197970,L272970,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too."
197971,L272915,u5803,m384,HONORA,leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
197972,L272914,u5805,m384,PAULINE,He's the manager!
197973,L272820,u5803,m384,HONORA,glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
197974,L272819,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"Got an A, Mum!"
197975,L272818,u5803,m384,HONORA,Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
197976,L272817,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Hello!
197977,L273292,u5803,m384,HONORA,I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
197978,L273291,u5804,m384,JULIET,"But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!"
197979,L273258,u5803,m384,HONORA,Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
197980,L273257,u5804,m384,JULIET,Fruit.
197981,L273256,u5803,m384,HONORA,turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
197982,L273255,u5803,m384,HONORA,"is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently."
197983,L273254,u5804,m384,JULIET,"Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper."
197984,L273253,u5803,m384,HONORA,Oh-what a nice outfit!
197985,L273252,u5803,m384,HONORA,"Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket."
197986,L273251,u5804,m384,JULIET,Hello!
197987,L273017,u5804,m384,JULIET,"Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?"
197988,L273016,u5803,m384,HONORA,stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
197989,L273015,u5803,m384,HONORA,"We don't want to tire you out, dear."
197990,L273014,u5804,m384,JULIET,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued."
197991,L273013,u5803,m384,HONORA,looks startled at the outburst.
197992,L273012,u5804,m384,JULIET,"They sent me off to the Bahamas ""for the good of my health."" They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands ""for the good of my health."""
197993,L273011,u5803,m384,HONORA,"I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health."
197994,L273010,u5803,m384,HONORA,gives her a sympathetic look.
197995,L273009,u5804,m384,JULIET,I'm saving them for a rainy day.
197996,L273004,u5804,m384,JULIET,I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
197997,L273003,u5803,m384,HONORA,That's coming along well!
197998,L273002,u5804,m384,JULIET,Thank you so much!
197999,L273001,u5803,m384,HONORA,"It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit."
198000,L273000,u5803,m384,HONORA,hurries over.
198001,L272999,u5804,m384,JULIET,I'm so happy to see you!
198002,L272899,u5804,m384,JULIET,"Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it."
198003,L272898,u5803,m384,HONORA,I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
198004,L272895,u5804,m384,JULIET,"Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council."
198005,L272894,u5803,m384,HONORA,I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
198006,L272893,u5803,m384,HONORA,and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
198007,L272892,u5804,m384,JULIET,"And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!"
198008,L273285,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!"
198009,L273284,u5804,m384,JULIET,Isn't it beautiful!
198010,L273280,u5804,m384,JULIET,"Goodbye, Mr. Rieper."
198011,L273279,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"Bye, Dad."
198012,L273266,u5804,m384,JULIET,I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
198013,L273265,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
198014,L273264,u5804,m384,JULIET,Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
198015,L273263,u5805,m384,PAULINE,It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
198016,L273261,u5804,m384,JULIET,"All right, then."
198017,L273260,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night."
198018,L273244,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Mummy!
198019,L273243,u5804,m384,JULIET,Mummy!
198020,L273232,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I know what to do about mother.
198021,L273231,u5804,m384,JULIET,Yes . . .
198022,L273230,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I'm coming with you.
198023,L273204,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I need my sodding parents' consent.
198024,L273203,u5804,m384,JULIET,But that's not true! I've got one.
198025,L273159,u5804,m384,JULIET,"Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other."
198026,L273158,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Poor Father . . .
198027,L273157,u5804,m384,JULIET,Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
198028,L273156,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
198029,L273155,u5804,m384,JULIET,Poor Mother was completely taken in.
198030,L273152,u5804,m384,JULIET,That was what we were led to believe . . .
198031,L273151,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
198032,L273145,u5804,m384,JULIET,That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
198033,L273144,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
198034,L273143,u5804,m384,JULIET,This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
198035,L273142,u5804,m384,JULIET,They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
198036,L273141,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
198037,L273140,u5804,m384,JULIET,"I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!"
198038,L273139,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Just a couple more . . .
198039,L273138,u5804,m384,JULIET,Hurry up! I'm freezing!
198040,L273137,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
198041,L273133,u5804,m384,JULIET,You mean travel by ourselves?
198042,L273132,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Let's go overseas . . .
198043,L273131,u5804,m384,JULIET,"No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!"
198044,L273130,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I think I'm going crazy.
198045,L273028,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
198046,L273027,u5804,m384,JULIET,How do you know? Did he tell you?
198047,L273026,u5804,m384,JULIET,That idiot boarder?
198048,L273025,u5805,m384,PAULINE,John has fallen in love with me!
198049,L273024,u5804,m384,JULIET,What??
198050,L273023,u5805,m384,PAULINE,You'll never guess what's happened!!
198051,L272953,u5804,m384,JULIET,"I couldn't have done it without you, Charles."
198052,L272952,u5805,m384,PAULINE,You're such an incredible woman.
198053,L272951,u5804,m384,JULIET,I shall call him Diello.
198054,L272944,u5805,m384,PAULINE,What???
198055,L272943,u5804,m384,JULIET,It's so beautiful!
198056,L272942,u5805,m384,PAULINE,What?
198057,L272929,u5804,m384,JULIET,"God, yes!"
198058,L272928,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!"
198059,L272874,u5805,m384,PAULINE,That . . .
198060,L272873,u5804,m384,JULIET,That.
198061,L272872,u5805,m384,PAULINE,This . . .
198062,L272871,u5804,m384,JULIET,This.
198063,L272870,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Him . . .
198064,L272869,u5804,m384,JULIET,Him.
198065,L272868,u5805,m384,PAULINE,He . . .
198066,L272867,u5804,m384,JULIET,To be known as He!
198067,L272866,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Saint Mario!
198068,L272865,u5804,m384,JULIET,James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
198069,L272863,u5804,m384,JULIET,"I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians."
198070,L272862,u5805,m384,PAULINE,"But, we're all going to Heaven!"
198071,L272861,u5804,m384,JULIET,Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
198072,L272860,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
198073,L272853,u5804,m384,JULIET,"Don't . . . please! Please, don't!"
198074,L272852,u5805,m384,PAULINE,I think I'm dying . . .
198075,L272844,u5804,m384,JULIET,Of course it matters! It's Mario!
198076,L272843,u5805,m384,PAULINE,It doesn't matter.
198077,L272842,u5804,m384,JULIET,"0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!"
198078,L272771,u5804,m384,JULIET,Somebody's got to help us!
198079,L272770,u5805,m384,PAULINE,She's terribly hurt . . .
198080,L272768,u5805,m384,PAULINE,Mummy!
198081,L272767,u5804,m384,JULIET,Mummy!
198082,L276401,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
198083,L276400,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
198084,L276399,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad."
198085,L276301,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Just get better okay?
198086,L276300,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
198087,L276299,u5806,m385,ALLISON,No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
198088,L276298,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I understand... I won't-
198089,L276297,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients."
198090,L276296,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Sorry.
198091,L276293,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What was it?
198092,L276292,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over"
198093,L276291,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
198094,L276290,u5806,m385,ALLISON,No.
198095,L276289,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Did I ever talk about the accident?
198096,L276288,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
198097,L276287,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Well?
198098,L276286,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Sure plenty of times.
198099,L276284,u5820,m385,TREVOR,No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
198100,L276283,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
198101,L276282,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
198102,L276281,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
198103,L276280,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I did more then that.
198104,L276279,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing."
198105,L276278,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew."
198106,L276277,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"I understand, I think. Other women?"
198107,L276276,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words."
198108,L276274,u5806,m385,ALLISON,You just made that up.
198109,L276273,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Pitbull attacks.
198110,L276272,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Eighty third most common.
198111,L276271,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Skin cancer.
198112,L276270,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Second most common?
198113,L276269,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
198114,L276268,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
198115,L276267,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
198116,L276266,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Okay so... what's the safest place?
198117,L276265,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
198118,L276264,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Bull...
198119,L276263,u5820,m385,TREVOR,It's inside a moving car.
198120,L276262,u5806,m385,ALLISON,I'm stumped.
198121,L276261,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Hint. It's not a geographical location.
198122,L276259,u5806,m385,ALLISON,All finished.
198123,L276258,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"So, I'm done. Thats it for today?"
198124,L276257,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"I know, my bedside manner's horrendous."
198125,L276256,u5820,m385,TREVOR,The way you just looked at me...
198126,L276255,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"Of course, yes."
198127,L276253,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity."
198128,L276252,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round."
198129,L276249,u5806,m385,ALLISON,I'm all over it.
198130,L276248,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
198131,L276247,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
198132,L276202,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I miss her. I miss my wife.
198133,L276201,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
198134,L276200,u5820,m385,TREVOR,If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
198135,L276199,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
198136,L276198,u5820,m385,TREVOR,These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
198137,L276105,u5806,m385,ALLISON,You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
198138,L276104,u5820,m385,TREVOR,No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
198139,L276103,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
198140,L276102,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
198141,L276098,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"No wisdom, no insight, no plan."
198142,L276097,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Your insight is enlightening.
198143,L276096,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on."
198144,L276095,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
198145,L276094,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
198146,L276092,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor."
198147,L276091,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What's happening to me? What are you doing?
198148,L275995,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Your wife...?
198149,L275994,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
198150,L275993,u5806,m385,ALLISON,"It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open."
198151,L275992,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
198152,L275991,u5806,m385,ALLISON,Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
198153,L275990,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Are you a dream too?
198154,L276430,u5807,m385,BRET,"I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed."
198155,L276429,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
198156,L276428,u5807,m385,BRET,We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
198157,L276427,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Bret. What the hell is going on?
198158,L276426,u5807,m385,BRET,"Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it."
198159,L276425,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Bret... what the fuck...?
198160,L276332,u5807,m385,BRET,Someone special.
198161,L276331,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Yeah? You and who else?
198162,L276330,u5807,m385,BRET,Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
198163,L276329,u5820,m385,TREVOR,So you're just packing it up just like that?
198164,L276327,u5807,m385,BRET,As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
198165,L276326,u5820,m385,TREVOR,How much time off?
198166,L276325,u5807,m385,BRET,"I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work."
198167,L276324,u5807,m385,BRET,I quit. Today's my last day.
198168,L276323,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What's the occasion?
198169,L276322,u5807,m385,BRET,Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
198170,L276124,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
198171,L276123,u5807,m385,BRET,You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
198172,L276122,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
198173,L276121,u5807,m385,BRET,GWEN?
198174,L276120,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Gwen.
198175,L276119,u5807,m385,BRET,Really? Do tell.
198176,L276118,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I have my connections
198177,L276117,u5807,m385,BRET,"Yeah, how's that?"
198178,L276116,u5820,m385,TREVOR,The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
198179,L276112,u5807,m385,BRET,Getting paid for doing shit.
198180,L276111,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What?
198181,L276110,u5807,m385,BRET,Must be nice.
198182,L276007,u5807,m385,BRET,Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
198183,L276006,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Since what?
198184,L276005,u5807,m385,BRET,Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
198185,L276004,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
198186,L276003,u5807,m385,BRET,Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
198187,L276002,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut."
198188,L276001,u5807,m385,BRET,Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
198189,L276386,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Allison Dormere. Your intern.
198190,L276385,u5808,m385,DR. AMBROSE,Who's Allison?
198191,L276384,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Where's Allison?
198192,L276383,u5808,m385,DR. AMBROSE,Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
198193,L276381,u5808,m385,DR. AMBROSE,Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
198194,L276380,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I've been in here before.
198195,L276379,u5808,m385,DR. AMBROSE,Have we met?
198196,L276378,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Ambrose. I know.
198197,L276377,u5808,m385,DR. AMBROSE,Hello I'm Dr...
198198,L276451,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What's that?
198199,L276450,u5809,m385,GIVENS,Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
198200,L276162,u5809,m385,GIVENS,How many zeros was your wife worth?
198201,L276161,u5820,m385,TREVOR,As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
198202,L276160,u5809,m385,GIVENS,Zero's a number right?
198203,L276159,u5820,m385,TREVOR,You could say that.
198204,L276158,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"I saw her drowning inside the car, detective."
198205,L276157,u5809,m385,GIVENS,Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
198206,L276156,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What's the difference?
198207,L276155,u5809,m385,GIVENS,No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
198208,L276154,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I said she's been missing for-
198209,L276153,u5809,m385,GIVENS,What did you just say?
198210,L276082,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
198211,L276081,u5810,m385,GWEN,Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
198212,L276080,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What?
198213,L276079,u5810,m385,GWEN,Good boy.  Where's is it?
198214,L276025,u5810,m385,GWEN,"No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold."
198215,L276024,u5820,m385,TREVOR,That was cold...
198216,L276023,u5810,m385,GWEN,Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
198217,L276022,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Gwen, my wife's dead."
198218,L276021,u5810,m385,GWEN,YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
198219,L276020,u5810,m385,GWEN,And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
198220,L276019,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-"
198221,L276018,u5810,m385,GWEN,"What's wrong, Trev?"
198222,L276017,u5810,m385,GWEN,"How do you think you got this job, cock?  Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim."
198223,L276016,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me."
198224,L276015,u5810,m385,GWEN,"Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking."
198225,L276013,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
198226,L276012,u5810,m385,GWEN,"Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks."
198227,L276361,u5820,m385,TREVOR,It's perfect.
198228,L276360,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,"Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?"
198229,L276359,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
198230,L276358,u5820,m385,TREVOR,You're alive...
198231,L276357,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
198232,L276356,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Kirsty... Kirsty?
198233,L276073,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,"For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you."
198234,L276072,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding."
198235,L276070,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,I only married you for your body.
198236,L276069,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Really, why's that?"
198237,L276068,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,"And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money."
198238,L276067,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,"There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan"
198239,L276066,u5820,m385,TREVOR,But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
198240,L276065,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Really? Why?
198241,L276064,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,Never to put you in my will.
198242,L276063,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What?
198243,L276062,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
198244,L276061,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
198245,L276060,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
198246,L276059,u5820,m385,TREVOR,In a word? Lucrative.
198247,L276058,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
198248,L275979,u5820,m385,TREVOR,This isn't happening.
198249,L275978,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,"OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out."
198250,L275976,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
198251,L275975,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What?
198252,L275974,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,Oh my God. It's coming out.
198253,L275970,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
198254,L275969,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
198255,L275968,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,You've been cheating on me haven't you?
198256,L275967,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
198257,L275965,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
198258,L275964,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
198259,L275961,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
198260,L275960,u5820,m385,TREVOR,But... I thought...
198261,L275959,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,You win! Okay pull over.
198262,L275958,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Eighty four.
198263,L275957,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,Uh... eighty two?

198265,L275955,u5811,m385,KIRSTY,Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
198266,L275954,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
198267,L276456,u5812,m385,LANGE,That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
198268,L276455,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Morgue...?
198269,L276319,u5812,m385,LANGE,We're all here for you Trevor.

198271,L276317,u5812,m385,LANGE,The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?

198273,L276315,u5812,m385,LANGE,"Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges."

198275,L276311,u5812,m385,LANGE,You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
198276,L276310,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
198277,L276309,u5812,m385,LANGE,I thought you loved games.
198278,L276307,u5820,m385,TREVOR,No please make yourself at home.

198281,L276036,u5820,m385,TREVOR,It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
198282,L276035,u5812,m385,LANGE,"For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally."
198283,L276034,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What evidence?
198284,L276033,u5812,m385,LANGE,Okay then. Here's the scoop.
198285,L276032,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Where's my wife?
198286,L276031,u5812,m385,LANGE,Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
198287,L276243,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
198288,L276242,u5813,m385,LARRY,Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
198289,L276241,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
198290,L276240,u5813,m385,LARRY,"Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city."

198292,L276238,u5813,m385,LARRY,Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
198293,L276237,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
198294,L276233,u5820,m385,TREVOR,How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
198295,L276232,u5813,m385,LARRY,"And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this."
198296,L276231,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-"
198297,L276230,u5813,m385,LARRY,Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
198298,L276229,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
198299,L276228,u5813,m385,LARRY,A little? Try unbelievably.
198300,L276227,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
198301,L276406,u5814,m385,OLD MAN,Who the hell are you talking to?
198302,L276405,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What do you want?!
198303,L276404,u5814,m385,OLD MAN,Hey buddy!
198304,L276403,u5820,m385,TREVOR,... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
198305,L276402,u5814,m385,OLD MAN,Hey buddy!
198306,L276396,u5814,m385,OLD MAN,Music to my ears.
198307,L276395,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I don't work here.
198308,L276394,u5814,m385,OLD MAN,Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
198309,L276373,u5815,m385,PARAMEDIC,Wow you are out of it.
198310,L276372,u5820,m385,TREVOR,You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
198311,L276371,u5815,m385,PARAMEDIC,Can you follow them?
198312,L276370,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Two.
198313,L276369,u5815,m385,PARAMEDIC,Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
198314,L276367,u5815,m385,PARAMEDIC,We're just gonna take some blood here.
198315,L276366,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Ambulance.
198316,L276365,u5815,m385,PARAMEDIC,Do you know where you are?
198317,L276466,u5816,m385,PINHEAD,You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
198318,L276465,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What's under that sheet...?
198319,L276461,u5816,m385,PINHEAD,Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
198320,L276460,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
198321,L276459,u5816,m385,PINHEAD,How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
198322,L276423,u5816,m385,PINHEAD,I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
198323,L276422,u5820,m385,TREVOR,This game is over do you hear me?
198324,L276421,u5816,m385,PINHEAD,Poor Trevor.
198325,L276418,u5817,m385,PRIEST,Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
198326,L276417,u5820,m385,TREVOR,But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
198327,L276416,u5817,m385,PRIEST,All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
198328,L276415,u5820,m385,TREVOR,But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
198329,L276411,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
198330,L276410,u5817,m385,PRIEST,What things do you think you've done?
198331,L276409,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out..."
198332,L276355,u5818,m385,SAGE,Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
198333,L276354,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Wait... what the hell is this...
198334,L276353,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I surrender...
198335,L276352,u5818,m385,SAGE,Are you ready?
198336,L276351,u5818,m385,SAGE,"You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again."
198337,L276350,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
198338,L276349,u5818,m385,SAGE,It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
198339,L276348,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop."
198340,L276347,u5818,m385,SAGE,"My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity."
198341,L276346,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
198342,L276345,u5818,m385,SAGE,Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
198343,L276139,u5818,m385,SAGE,You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
198344,L276138,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
198345,L276137,u5818,m385,SAGE,Dreams?
198346,L276210,u5819,m385,TAWNY,WHAT?!
198347,L276209,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night."
198348,L276208,u5819,m385,TAWNY,Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
198349,L276207,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on..."
198350,L276206,u5819,m385,TAWNY,"Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?"
198351,L276194,u5819,m385,TAWNY,Well now there's a compliment.
198352,L276193,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
198353,L276189,u5819,m385,TAWNY,It's getting hot in here.
198354,L276188,u5820,m385,TREVOR,You must have been very proud of yourselves...
198355,L276187,u5819,m385,TAWNY,"If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid."
198356,L276185,u5819,m385,TAWNY,"For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew."
198357,L276184,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?"
198358,L276182,u5819,m385,TAWNY,God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
198359,L276181,u5820,m385,TREVOR,I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
198360,L276180,u5819,m385,TAWNY,I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
198361,L276179,u5819,m385,TAWNY,Really?
198362,L276178,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually."
198363,L276177,u5819,m385,TAWNY,You okay?
198364,L276176,u5819,m385,TAWNY,YOU!
198365,L276175,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
198366,L276174,u5819,m385,TAWNY,You.
198367,L276173,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"Uh... sure, Tawny... what?"
198368,L276172,u5819,m385,TAWNY,Hey. Can I borrow something?
198369,L276056,u5819,m385,TAWNY,Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
198370,L276055,u5820,m385,TREVOR,It's not that kind of date.
198371,L276054,u5819,m385,TAWNY,The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
198372,L276053,u5820,m385,TREVOR,Last week...
198373,L276052,u5820,m385,TREVOR,What do you mean?
198374,L276051,u5819,m385,TAWNY,Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
198375,L276050,u5820,m385,TREVOR,-Tawny.
198376,L276049,u5820,m385,TREVOR,"No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-"
198377,L276048,u5819,m385,TAWNY,"... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac."
198378,L278466,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John."
198379,L278465,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there."
198380,L278444,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up."
198381,L278443,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine."
198382,L278442,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"There was this kid there saying, ""Go in there and save my father, mister."" And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself."
198383,L278441,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe."
198384,L278440,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes."
198385,L278433,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"That's good enough for me.  You better take that ""letter"" there and get rid of it."
198386,L278432,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie."
198387,L278431,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison."
198388,L278430,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to..."
198389,L278429,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man."
198390,L278428,u5822,m386,BUBBER,And give a deposition to the jUdge.
198391,L278427,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee..."
198392,L278401,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half."
198393,L278400,u5821,m386,BERNIE,Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
198394,L278399,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La..."
198395,L278398,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?"
198396,L278397,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me."
198397,L278395,u5822,m386,BUBBER,Allen?  He... he's okay?
198398,L278394,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him."
198399,L278393,u5822,m386,BUBBER,It was you!  I thought I heard...
198400,L278392,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards ."
198401,L278391,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!"
198402,L278390,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!"
198403,L278389,u5822,m386,BUBBER,Huh?  Whadda you mean?
198404,L278388,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John."
198405,L278387,u5821,m386,BERNIE,Right.
198406,L278386,u5822,m386,BUBBER,And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
198407,L278385,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy."
198408,L278384,u5822,m386,BUBBER,You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
198409,L278378,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?"
198410,L278377,u5822,m386,BUBBER,What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
198411,L278376,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump."
198412,L278375,u5822,m386,BUBBER,You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
198413,L278374,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here."
198414,L278373,u5822,m386,BUBBER,The bathroom!  For two days?
198415,L278372,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"I was in the can, for Chrissake."
198416,L278371,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me..."
198417,L278370,u5821,m386,BERNIE,I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
198418,L278369,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems."
198419,L278368,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!"
198420,L278367,u5822,m386,BUBBER,That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
198421,L278365,u5821,m386,BERNIE,In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
198422,L278364,u5822,m386,BUBBER,Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
198423,L278363,u5821,m386,BERNIE,I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
198424,L278360,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights."
198425,L278359,u5822,m386,BUBBER,LaPlante!
198426,L278358,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy."
198427,L277952,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  ""Keep a low profile,"" that's my motto."
198428,L277951,u5822,m386,BUBBER,They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
198429,L277950,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay."
198430,L277949,u5822,m386,BUBBER,I know a guy who only has one leg.
198431,L277948,u5821,m386,BERNIE,One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
198432,L277947,u5822,m386,BUBBER,You should give it to someone with only one leg.
198433,L277945,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up."
198434,L277944,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!"
198435,L277943,u5822,m386,BUBBER,I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
198436,L277942,u5821,m386,BERNIE,You got a drinking problem or what?
198437,L277940,u5821,m386,BERNIE,Try stupid.
198438,L277939,u5822,m386,BUBBER,A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
198439,L277938,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid."
198440,L277937,u5822,m386,BUBBER,And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
198441,L278189,u5826,m386,DONNA,You mean John Bubber?
198442,L278188,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double."
198443,L278187,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!"
198444,L278186,u5826,m386,DONNA,"I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but.."
198445,L278185,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Hey, you could call me ""Bernie,"" forget the ""Mister LaPlante"" stuff.  You are naive."
198446,L278184,u5826,m386,DONNA,"So you can call me ""naive,"" Mister LaPlante."
198447,L278183,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?"

198590,L278509,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about ""truth."" Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?"
198591,L278494,u5821,m386,BERNIE,JOEY!
198592,L278493,u5831,m386,JOEY,"Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo."

198595,L277701,u5831,m386,JOEY,I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
198596,L277700,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff..."

198604,L277683,u5831,m386,JOEY,Were you in it?  In the war?
198605,L277682,u5821,m386,BERNIE,It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.

198608,L277679,u5831,m386,JOEY,Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
198609,L277678,u5821,m386,BERNIE,"This guy, this ""friend"" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?"

198614,L278350,u5822,m386,BUBBER,Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
198615,L278240,u5829,m386,GALE,"It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time."
198616,L278239,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"It's not right, Gale..."
198617,L278237,u5822,m386,BUBBER,Bodybuilding!
198618,L278236,u5829,m386,GALE,I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.

198622,L278232,u5829,m386,GALE,You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.

198641,L278129,u5829,m386,GALE,"John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you."
198642,L278128,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and..."
198643,L278116,u5829,m386,GALE,"You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both."
198644,L278115,u5822,m386,BUBBER,Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
198645,L278111,u5829,m386,GALE,...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
198646,L278110,u5822,m386,BUBBER,Yes.
198647,L278109,u5829,m386,GALE,"Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud..."
198648,L278106,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --"
198649,L278105,u5829,m386,GALE,"All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?"
198650,L278104,u5822,m386,BUBBER,"Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect..."
198651,L278103,u5829,m386,GALE,You were saying you don't want a million dollars.

198653,L278337,u5829,m386,GALE,"Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when ""good sense"" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?"
198654,L278336,u5824,m386,CHUCKY,He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
198655,L278335,u5829,m386,GALE,"And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John."
198656,L278334,u5824,m386,CHUCKY,Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!

198670,L277731,u5824,m386,CHUCKY,"Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop."
198671,L277730,u5829,m386,GALE,"Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?"
198672,L278174,u5829,m386,GALE,He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.

198674,L278013,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
198675,L278012,u5829,m386,GALE,There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?

198682,L277759,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,That too.
198683,L277758,u5829,m386,GALE,"The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean."
198684,L277757,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,"She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis."

198686,L277750,u5829,m386,GALE,You just can't bear the idea of good news.
198687,L277749,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,Unprofessional.

198690,L278507,u5834,m386,WALLACE,The Presidency.  The public loves him.
198691,L278506,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,What?
198692,L278505,u5834,m386,WALLACE,It's not unthinkable.
198693,L278414,u5834,m386,WALLACE,"No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars."
198694,L278413,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,Helluva story!

It's unprofessional!"
198702,L278172,u5834,m386,WALLACE,"We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings."
198703,L278171,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,She's talking to him now.
198704,L278170,u5834,m386,WALLACE,"He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?"
198705,L278169,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,Said he's not an actor.
198706,L278168,u5834,m386,WALLACE,Upset!  What's he upset about?
198707,L278095,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,"Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background."
198708,L278094,u5834,m386,WALLACE,Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
198709,L278093,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,"Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out."
198710,L278092,u5834,m386,WALLACE,"I thought they'd all go ""It's him! It's him!"" and hug the guy or something."
198711,L278011,u5834,m386,WALLACE,What about a reward for coming forward?
198712,L278010,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,"We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive..."
198713,L278009,u5834,m386,WALLACE,It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
198714,L278008,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,"Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally."
198715,L277754,u5834,m386,WALLACE,A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!

198718,L277743,u5834,m386,WALLACE,"You wouldn't push the guy, would you?"
198719,L277742,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
198720,L277739,u5834,m386,WALLACE,"If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself."
198721,L277738,u5825,m386,DEAKINS,He's right.  It's unprofessional.

198740,L277737,u5829,m386,GALE,"Hello, Mister Wallace."
198741,L277736,u5834,m386,WALLACE,Never reach out!
198742,L277735,u5829,m386,GALE,"Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?"
198743,L278285,u5829,m386,GALE,"I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston..."
198744,L278284,u5835,m386,WINSTON,No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
198745,L278281,u5835,m386,WINSTON,"Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!"
198746,L278280,u5829,m386,GALE,Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
198747,L278278,u5829,m386,GALE,"We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but..."
198748,L278277,u5835,m386,WINSTON,"""This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!""  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?"
198749,L278276,u5829,m386,GALE,"We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --"
198750,L278275,u5835,m386,WINSTON,"LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?"
198751,L278157,u5829,m386,GALE,Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
198752,L278156,u5830,m386,JOAN,Reporters don't have hormones?
198753,L278155,u5829,m386,GALE,Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
198754,L278154,u5830,m386,JOAN,You didn't... get it on with him?
198755,L278153,u5829,m386,GALE,He's pretty... remarkable.
198756,L278152,u5830,m386,JOAN,Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
198757,L277998,u5829,m386,GALE,Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
198758,L277997,u5830,m386,JOAN,"There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get."
198759,L278099,u5829,m386,GALE,"Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?"
198760,L278098,u5832,m386,PARKER,"Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants..."
198761,L278097,u5829,m386,GALE,Who?
198762,L278096,u5832,m386,PARKER,"Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants..."
198763,L278064,u5829,m386,GALE,Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
198764,L278063,u5832,m386,PARKER,I didn't ask him.
198765,L278062,u5829,m386,GALE,What about?
198766,L278061,u5832,m386,PARKER,"Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him."
198767,L278843,u5836,m387,BERT,"Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal."
198768,L278842,u5838,m387,HIDER,"So this really does the trick, eh?"
198769,L278841,u5836,m387,BERT,They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
198770,L278840,u5838,m387,HIDER,How are they with kids?
198771,L278839,u5836,m387,BERT,Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
198772,L278838,u5836,m387,BERT,"Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out."
198773,L278837,u5838,m387,HIDER,Safety?
198774,L278836,u5836,m387,BERT,"You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?"
198775,L278835,u5838,m387,HIDER,You test each one thoroughly?
198776,L278978,u5837,m387,BULLY,What toys do you have?
198777,L278977,u5841,m387,NEIL,A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
198778,L278976,u5837,m387,BULLY,Where are these toys of yours?
198779,L278975,u5841,m387,NEIL,Let's watch some TV.
198780,L278974,u5837,m387,BULLY,So where are all your toys?
198781,L278964,u5841,m387,NEIL,"Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor."
198782,L278963,u5837,m387,BULLY,Was that your dad?
198783,L278771,u5837,m387,BULLY,"Whoa, check it out."
198784,L278770,u5841,m387,NEIL,"Give it here, Bernard."
198785,L278661,u5837,m387,BULLY,They're really white.
198786,L278660,u5841,m387,NEIL,"Hey, c'mon."
198787,L278659,u5837,m387,BULLY,"I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?"
198788,L278658,u5841,m387,NEIL,Okay.
198789,L278657,u5837,m387,BULLY,"So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?"
198790,L278628,u5838,m387,HIDER,Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
198791,L278627,u5846,m387,SALESGIRL,"Wife, girlfriend or mother?"
198792,L278626,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Well, it's for a woman."
198793,L278625,u5846,m387,SALESGIRL,Any particular brand?
198794,L278624,u5838,m387,HIDER,I'm looking for some perfume.
198795,L278623,u5846,m387,SALESGIRL,"Are you being helped, sir?"
198796,L279017,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"Well, you'll just have to <u>make</u> her understand."
198797,L279016,u5838,m387,HIDER,"There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --"
198798,L279015,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
198799,L279014,u5838,m387,HIDER,I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
198800,L279013,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport."
198801,L278918,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
198802,L278917,u5838,m387,HIDER,Right.
198803,L278916,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
198804,L278915,u5838,m387,HIDER,I should.
198805,L278914,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
198806,L278913,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her."
198807,L278912,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection."
198808,L278911,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words."
198809,L278910,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself."
198810,L278909,u5838,m387,HIDER,I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
198811,L278908,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,Who doesn't?
198812,L278907,u5838,m387,HIDER,Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
198813,L278833,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,A sense of proportion.
198814,L278832,u5838,m387,HIDER,-- a sense of proportion.
198815,L278831,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
198816,L278830,u5838,m387,HIDER,That would be stupid.
198817,L278829,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --"
198818,L278828,u5838,m387,HIDER,"No, no, no, no."
198819,L278827,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --"
198820,L278826,u5838,m387,HIDER,I understand that.
198821,L278825,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life."
198822,L278824,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing."
198823,L278823,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,As long as you keep remembering why.
198824,L278822,u5838,m387,HIDER,I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
198825,L278821,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
198826,L278820,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her."
198827,L278819,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?"
198828,L278670,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control."
198829,L278669,u5838,m387,HIDER,"I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever."
198830,L278667,u5838,m387,HIDER,When I was a child... I got used to the closets.  The boxes.  The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip.  I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood.  Cardboard.  I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard.  That smelled like rust and decay.  It was safe in the boxes.  It was when they took me out --
198831,L278666,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be."
198832,L278665,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky."
198833,L278545,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time."
198834,L278544,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like."
198835,L278543,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people."
198836,L278542,u5838,m387,HIDER,-- institution.
198837,L278541,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,-- hospital.
198838,L278540,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --"
198839,L278539,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?"
198840,L278538,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing."
198841,L278537,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
198842,L278536,u5838,m387,HIDER,Right.
198843,L278535,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,"All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an ""up"" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon."
198844,L278534,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place."
198845,L278533,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,And the rent is okay?
198846,L278532,u5838,m387,HIDER,"It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along."
198847,L278531,u5848,m387,THERAPIST,How's the new place?
198848,L279076,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home."
198849,L279075,u5838,m387,HIDER,About us.
198850,L279074,u5840,m387,JULIE,About what?
198851,L279073,u5838,m387,HIDER,I think we should talk first.
198852,L279072,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed."
198853,L279071,u5838,m387,HIDER,It is tomorrow.
198854,L279070,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor."
198855,L279069,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do."
198856,L279068,u5840,m387,JULIE,Uh huh.
198857,L279067,u5838,m387,HIDER,I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
198858,L279052,u5840,m387,JULIE,Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
198859,L279051,u5838,m387,HIDER,What happened?
198860,L279050,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night."
198861,L279049,u5838,m387,HIDER,I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
198862,L279012,u5838,m387,HIDER,Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
198863,L279011,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty."
198864,L279010,u5838,m387,HIDER,"I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you."
198865,L279009,u5840,m387,JULIE,It's nice that you can make that choice.
198866,L279008,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people."
198867,L279007,u5840,m387,JULIE,You must value your independence.
198868,L279006,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down."
198869,L279005,u5840,m387,JULIE,Do you have a family?
198870,L279004,u5838,m387,HIDER,It's a living.
198871,L279003,u5840,m387,JULIE,I bet.  Going into people's homes.
198872,L279002,u5838,m387,HIDER,"An occupational hazard, I'm afraid."
198873,L279001,u5840,m387,JULIE,I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
198874,L278954,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Oh, that's fine."
198875,L278953,u5838,m387,HIDER,"-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning."
198876,L278952,u5840,m387,JULIE,"So, you're just kind of a roving --"
198877,L278951,u5838,m387,HIDER,Isn't that always the way?
198878,L278950,u5840,m387,JULIE,Everything breaks at once.
198879,L278949,u5838,m387,HIDER,Just show me the way.
198880,L278948,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Do you do washing machines, too?"
198881,L278947,u5838,m387,HIDER,"Yeah, that was easy."
198882,L278946,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Oh, great."
198883,L278945,u5838,m387,HIDER,Maybe I could take a look at it now.
198884,L278944,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Well, can I make an appointment?"
198885,L278943,u5838,m387,HIDER,Sure.
198886,L278942,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?"
198887,L279031,u5840,m387,JULIE,"It's okay, baby, the police are coming."
198888,L279030,u5839,m387,HOLLY,Mommy!
198889,L278959,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line."
198890,L278958,u5839,m387,HOLLY,"""Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!""  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him."
198891,L278935,u5840,m387,JULIE,Holly -- that's not so.
198892,L278934,u5839,m387,HOLLY,Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
198893,L278931,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do."
198894,L278930,u5839,m387,HOLLY,Did Daddy tease you?
198895,L278929,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Well, that's what happens with grownups, too."
198896,L278928,u5839,m387,HOLLY,Uh huh.
198897,L278927,u5840,m387,JULIE,You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
198898,L278926,u5839,m387,HOLLY,Why are you mad at each other?
198899,L278925,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart."
198900,L278741,u5839,m387,HOLLY,Uh huh.
198901,L278740,u5840,m387,JULIE,A man?  Was it a dream?
198902,L278739,u5839,m387,HOLLY,A man scared me.
198903,L278738,u5840,m387,JULIE,"It's the middle of the night, sweetie."
198904,L278737,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Aw, okay."
198905,L278736,u5839,m387,HOLLY,I'm thirsty.
198906,L278735,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Baby, what is it?"
198907,L278655,u5839,m387,HOLLY,"Bye, Neil!"
198908,L278654,u5840,m387,JULIE,Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
198909,L278622,u5839,m387,HOLLY,"'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'"
198910,L278621,u5840,m387,JULIE,"'""... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!"" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '"
198911,L278584,u5840,m387,JULIE,"""Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"""
198912,L278583,u5839,m387,HOLLY,I found a cent!
198913,L278718,u5845,m387,RITA,He'll never appreciate it more.
198914,L278717,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Rita, he's only twelve years old,"
198915,L278714,u5845,m387,RITA,Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
198916,L278713,u5840,m387,JULIE,I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
198917,L278712,u5845,m387,RITA,"I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation."
198918,L278711,u5840,m387,JULIE,"The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss."
198919,L278710,u5845,m387,RITA,And?
198920,L278709,u5840,m387,JULIE,I've asked him what's wrong.
198921,L278708,u5845,m387,RITA,Have you just plain asked him?
198922,L278707,u5840,m387,JULIE,"No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt."
198923,L278706,u5845,m387,RITA,So you don't have anything concrete?
198924,L278705,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today."
198925,L278704,u5845,m387,RITA,You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
198926,L279062,u5841,m387,NEIL,"That's okay, Mom."
198927,L279061,u5840,m387,JULIE,Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
198928,L279060,u5841,m387,NEIL,"No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now."
198929,L279059,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?"
198930,L279025,u5841,m387,NEIL,"Mom, I heard someone downstairs!"
198931,L279024,u5840,m387,JULIE,Honey --
198932,L279023,u5841,m387,NEIL,"Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!"
198933,L279022,u5840,m387,JULIE,Neil -- what --
198934,L278933,u5840,m387,JULIE,"He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school."
198935,L278932,u5841,m387,NEIL,Where'd he go?
198936,L278890,u5841,m387,NEIL,I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
198937,L278889,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Neil, you could have burned the house down!"
198938,L278783,u5841,m387,NEIL,"Thanks, Mom."
198939,L278782,u5840,m387,JULIE,"The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?"
198940,L278781,u5841,m387,NEIL,Whew.
198941,L278780,u5840,m387,JULIE,I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
198942,L278779,u5841,m387,NEIL,Thank God.
198943,L278766,u5841,m387,NEIL,I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
198944,L278765,u5840,m387,JULIE,He doesn't have a temperature.
198945,L278744,u5841,m387,NEIL,RUDOLF!
198946,L278743,u5840,m387,JULIE,"No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?"
198947,L278742,u5841,m387,NEIL,Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
198948,L278678,u5841,m387,NEIL,"But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!"
198949,L278677,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Here, take this out to the table."
198950,L278676,u5841,m387,NEIL,I could take a cab on the way home.
198951,L278675,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?"
198952,L278674,u5841,m387,NEIL,Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
198953,L278630,u5841,m387,NEIL,"""We don't want to be late for our first day of school."""
198954,L278629,u5840,m387,JULIE,"C'mon, kids, let's go."
198955,L279047,u5840,m387,JULIE,We'll talk in the morning.
198956,L279046,u5843,m387,PHIL,Should I come home when I'm finished there?
198957,L279042,u5843,m387,PHIL,Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
198958,L279041,u5840,m387,JULIE,Oh God.
198959,L279000,u5843,m387,PHIL,This is my house.
198960,L278999,u5840,m387,JULIE,"No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>."
198961,L278998,u5843,m387,PHIL,What?
198962,L278997,u5840,m387,JULIE,That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
198963,L278996,u5843,m387,PHIL,I think it's time I came home now.
198964,L278995,u5840,m387,JULIE,"There's always an excuse, isn't there?"
198965,L278994,u5843,m387,PHIL,"I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --"
198966,L278993,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Look, I think we should work things out."
198967,L278992,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?"
198968,L278991,u5843,m387,PHIL,And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
198969,L278990,u5840,m387,JULIE,"I'm having the floor fixed,"
198970,L278989,u5843,m387,PHIL,Who was that?
198971,L278923,u5843,m387,PHIL,"I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!"
198972,L278922,u5840,m387,JULIE,You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
198973,L278921,u5840,m387,JULIE,"""Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."""
198974,L278920,u5843,m387,PHIL,"This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!"
198975,L278919,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?"
198976,L278906,u5843,m387,PHIL,Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
198977,L278905,u5840,m387,JULIE,That's not the case.
198978,L278904,u5843,m387,PHIL,I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
198979,L278903,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent."
198980,L278899,u5843,m387,PHIL,There might be some extras in the garage.
198981,L278898,u5840,m387,JULIE,Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
198982,L278882,u5843,m387,PHIL,<u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u> <u>showed up for our lunch</u>!  It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some --  Do you smell smoke?
198983,L278881,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Oh, honey."
198984,L278880,u5843,m387,PHIL,"I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>."
198985,L278879,u5840,m387,JULIE,What?
198986,L278878,u5843,m387,PHIL,He wasn't there.
198987,L278877,u5840,m387,JULIE,Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
198988,L278865,u5843,m387,PHIL,C'mon.
198989,L278864,u5840,m387,JULIE,I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
198990,L278863,u5843,m387,PHIL,What -- what are you doing?
198991,L278861,u5840,m387,JULIE,Oh baby.
198992,L278860,u5843,m387,PHIL,His secretary just confirmed.
198993,L278859,u5840,m387,JULIE,Philip!  The senior partner?
198994,L278858,u5843,m387,PHIL,He wants to see me!
198995,L278848,u5840,m387,JULIE,Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
198996,L278847,u5843,m387,PHIL,The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
198997,L278846,u5840,m387,JULIE,Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
198998,L278845,u5843,m387,PHIL,Did the cleaning woman come?
198999,L278817,u5840,m387,JULIE,Did you lock the garage door?
199000,L278816,u5843,m387,PHIL,I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
199001,L278815,u5840,m387,JULIE,Where should I hide the car keys?
199002,L278814,u5843,m387,PHIL,The cab's waiting!
199003,L278813,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see."
199004,L278812,u5840,m387,JULIE,I thought we'd be happy here.
199005,L278811,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Fuck you, Philip."
199006,L278810,u5843,m387,PHIL,Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
199007,L278809,u5840,m387,JULIE,There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
199008,L278808,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>."
199009,L278807,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Do you usually pay for Charlie? At ""Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>""?"
199010,L278806,u5843,m387,PHIL,Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
199011,L278805,u5840,m387,JULIE,"I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth."
199012,L278804,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that."
199013,L278803,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Well, what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!"
199014,L278802,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket."
199015,L278801,u5840,m387,JULIE,I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
199016,L278800,u5843,m387,PHIL,What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
199017,L278799,u5840,m387,JULIE,"No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>."
199018,L278751,u5840,m387,JULIE,Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
199019,L278750,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time."
199020,L278732,u5840,m387,JULIE,I know someone else who's sensitive.
199021,L278731,u5843,m387,PHIL,"I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive."
199022,L278730,u5843,m387,PHIL,"He's made some friends, hasn't he?"
199023,L278729,u5840,m387,JULIE,Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
199024,L278728,u5843,m387,PHIL,One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
199025,L278727,u5840,m387,JULIE,How long does it have to be a new house?
199026,L278726,u5843,m387,PHIL,All new houses have noises.
199027,L278725,u5840,m387,JULIE,"I hear things in this house,"
199028,L278724,u5840,m387,JULIE,There's no card or anything.
199029,L278723,u5843,m387,PHIL,No.
199030,L278722,u5840,m387,JULIE,Do you remember who gave us this?
199031,L278684,u5843,m387,PHIL,"<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?"
199032,L278683,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?"
199033,L278682,u5843,m387,PHIL,Oh -- great.
199034,L278681,u5840,m387,JULIE,How was your lunch with Charlie?
199035,L278680,u5843,m387,PHIL,Huh?
199036,L278679,u5840,m387,JULIE,How was lunch?
199037,L278650,u5840,m387,JULIE,"It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics."
199038,L278649,u5843,m387,PHIL,I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
199039,L278648,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar."
199040,L278647,u5843,m387,PHIL,-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
199041,L278646,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Honey, are you okay?"
199042,L278645,u5843,m387,PHIL,"He made, you know, a remark."
199043,L278644,u5840,m387,JULIE,What?
199044,L278643,u5843,m387,PHIL,Did you hear what he said?
199045,L278642,u5840,m387,JULIE,What?
199046,L278641,u5843,m387,PHIL,Did you hear that?
199047,L278634,u5843,m387,PHIL,Damn.
199048,L278633,u5840,m387,JULIE,"<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister."
199049,L278597,u5843,m387,PHIL,Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
199050,L278596,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Paul Newman in ""The Hustler."""
199051,L278595,u5843,m387,PHIL,How were we -- were we cool?
199052,L278579,u5843,m387,PHIL,"It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us."
199053,L278578,u5840,m387,JULIE,We're going to think about it.
199054,L278573,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed."
199055,L278572,u5840,m387,JULIE,What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
199056,L278569,u5843,m387,PHIL,It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
199057,L278568,u5840,m387,JULIE,And it's a shorter commute.
199058,L278567,u5843,m387,PHIL,"It's a nice pool, isn't it?"
199059,L278566,u5840,m387,JULIE,You could have a pool to cool off in.
199060,L278565,u5843,m387,PHIL,You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
199061,L278564,u5840,m387,JULIE,They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
199062,L278563,u5843,m387,PHIL,"You wanted furniture too, didn't you?"
199063,L278562,u5840,m387,JULIE,But it's what we want.
199064,L278561,u5843,m387,PHIL,"High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget."
199065,L278560,u5840,m387,JULIE,I know it's at the high end of our range --
199066,L278559,u5843,m387,PHIL,Stop knowing me so well.
199067,L278558,u5840,m387,JULIE,This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
199068,L278557,u5843,m387,PHIL,What's that?
199069,L278556,u5840,m387,JULIE,"You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,"
199070,L278555,u5843,m387,PHIL,What?
199071,L278554,u5840,m387,JULIE,"I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking."
199072,L278548,u5843,m387,PHIL,We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
199073,L278547,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool."
199074,L278546,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Neil, calm down."
199075,L278528,u5844,m387,REAL-ESTATE LADY,We must <u>always</u> count the husband. By my count there've been... four. But I still live in hope.
199076,L278527,u5840,m387,JULIE,Two -- three if you count the husband.
199077,L278526,u5844,m387,REAL-ESTATE LADY,How large is your brood?
199078,L278525,u5840,m387,JULIE,"Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing."
199079,L278524,u5844,m387,REAL-ESTATE LADY,You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
199080,L278523,u5844,m387,REAL-ESTATE LADY,Isn't it?
199081,L278522,u5840,m387,JULIE,"This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling."
199082,L278521,u5844,m387,REAL-ESTATE LADY,Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
199083,L278520,u5840,m387,JULIE,Just reduced.
199084,L278519,u5844,m387,REAL-ESTATE LADY,"Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything."
199085,L278518,u5840,m387,JULIE,Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
199086,L278517,u5844,m387,REAL-ESTATE LADY,Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
199087,L278516,u5840,m387,JULIE,"It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?"
199088,L278876,u5842,m387,NEIL'S FRIEND #1,"Put it out, man!"
199089,L278875,u5841,m387,NEIL,Shit!
199090,L278703,u5842,m387,NEIL'S FRIEND #1,"Grow up, Dreyer."
199091,L278702,u5841,m387,NEIL,It's fun.
199092,L278701,u5842,m387,NEIL'S FRIEND #1,"What for, dickweed?"
199093,L278700,u5841,m387,NEIL,Let's follow 'em.
199094,L278689,u5842,m387,NEIL'S FRIEND #1,Shut up.
199095,L278688,u5841,m387,NEIL,"God, your sister's really hot."
199096,L278901,u5843,m387,PHIL,Get on the other side of that.
199097,L278900,u5841,m387,NEIL,I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
199098,L278897,u5843,m387,PHIL,No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
199099,L278896,u5841,m387,NEIL,No.
199100,L278895,u5843,m387,PHIL,Do you see a man?
199101,L278892,u5841,m387,NEIL,-- A man.
199102,L278891,u5843,m387,PHIL,You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
199103,L278888,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!"
199104,L278887,u5841,m387,NEIL,A <u>man</u> started the fire.
199105,L278856,u5841,m387,NEIL,Can we keep him?
199106,L278855,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?"
199107,L278769,u5843,m387,PHIL,"What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!"
199108,L278768,u5841,m387,NEIL,And I can't help having a cold.
199109,L278767,u5843,m387,PHIL,Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
199110,L278764,u5841,m387,NEIL,The thermometer's broken.
199111,L278763,u5843,m387,PHIL,What did the thermometer say?
199112,L278762,u5841,m387,NEIL,I have a cold.
199113,L278761,u5843,m387,PHIL,"If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically."
199114,L278760,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?"
199115,L278759,u5841,m387,NEIL,"I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?"
199116,L278758,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get ""Mad"" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!"
199117,L278757,u5841,m387,NEIL,"All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go."
199118,L278746,u5841,m387,NEIL,"Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!"
199119,L278745,u5843,m387,PHIL,"Neil, do you mind?"
199120,L278632,u5841,m387,NEIL,I didn't.
199121,L278631,u5843,m387,PHIL,"All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?"
199122,L278618,u5841,m387,NEIL,No.
199123,L278617,u5843,m387,PHIL,We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
199124,L278616,u5841,m387,NEIL,What about cable?
199125,L278615,u5843,m387,PHIL,Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
199126,L278589,u5843,m387,PHIL,Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
199127,L278588,u5841,m387,NEIL,"Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!"
199128,L278577,u5843,m387,PHIL,Do you have enough money?
199129,L278576,u5841,m387,NEIL,Are we gonna buy this house?
199130,L278795,u5843,m387,PHIL,Really.
199131,L278794,u5847,m387,SECRETARY,Really?
199132,L278793,u5843,m387,PHIL,Uh huh.
199133,L278792,u5847,m387,SECRETARY,Would you?
199134,L278791,u5843,m387,PHIL,I'd like that.
199135,L278790,u5847,m387,SECRETARY,Promise.
199136,L278789,u5843,m387,PHIL,Promise?
199137,L278613,u5843,m387,PHIL,Thank you -- how efficient of you.
199138,L278612,u5847,m387,SECRETARY,That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
199139,L278611,u5843,m387,PHIL,Even cosier.
199140,L278610,u5847,m387,SECRETARY,Even better.
199141,L278609,u5843,m387,PHIL,It's a double.
199142,L278608,u5847,m387,SECRETARY,Is it a king or a queen?
199143,L278607,u5843,m387,PHIL,Right over here.
199144,L278606,u5847,m387,SECRETARY,Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
199145,L278605,u5843,m387,PHIL,And this -- is the master bedroom.
199146,L281491,u5865,m388,ROBBERY DETECTIVE,You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
199147,L281490,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
199148,L281489,u5865,m388,ROBBERY DETECTIVE,"Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword."
199149,L281488,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
199150,L281487,u5865,m388,ROBBERY DETECTIVE,Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
199151,L281486,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
199152,L281485,u5865,m388,ROBBERY DETECTIVE,"No joke, Lieutenant."
199153,L281484,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
199154,L281493,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Yes.
199155,L281492,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,You didn't see this.  Understand?
199156,L281474,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,"Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance."
199157,L281473,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,"Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?"
199158,L281472,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,They appear to be authentic.
199159,L281471,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,What do you think?
199160,L281464,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Talk to me about what?
199161,L281463,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
199162,L281462,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
199163,L281461,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Lieutenant?
199164,L281454,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Not now.  I'm busy.
199165,L281453,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Lieutenant Bedsoe?
199166,L281680,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,So?
199167,L281679,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
199168,L281678,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Why?
199169,L281677,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,I think it was England.
199170,L281676,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,He had to come from somewhere.
199171,L281675,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,"We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing."
199172,L281674,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Anything from the bank?
199173,L281521,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
199174,L281520,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,We don't have any proof of that.
199175,L281519,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,This ties in with Nash.
199176,L281518,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,"It's not a homicide, Lieutenant."
199177,L281517,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Tough.
199178,L281516,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,"Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one."
199179,L281515,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,"Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV."
199180,L281482,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,I'd like you to see this.
199181,L281481,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,"That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable."
199182,L281480,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
199183,L281479,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,"Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news."
199184,L281478,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
199185,L281477,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,What is it?
199186,L281476,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,"Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at."
199187,L281384,u5852,m388,DETECTIVE GRELEY,Yeah -- how'd you know that?
199188,L281383,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
199189,L281451,u5850,m388,CAPTAIN,"I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him."
199190,L281450,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
199191,L281449,u5850,m388,CAPTAIN,It's circumstantial.
199192,L281448,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
199193,L281447,u5850,m388,CAPTAIN,Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
199194,L281446,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,What?
199195,L281445,u5850,m388,CAPTAIN,"Interrogation's over, Bedsoe."
199196,L281444,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,"I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain."
199197,L281814,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
199198,L281813,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Yes -- I think it is.
199199,L281791,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Most people are afraid of death.
199200,L281790,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
199201,L281789,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Maybe he was a lousy shot.
199202,L281788,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
199203,L281787,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,It's late.
199204,L281786,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
199205,L281785,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
199206,L281784,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,"No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash."
199207,L281783,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Good evening, Lieutenant."
199208,L281459,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Get outta here.
199209,L281458,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Lieutenant, you're really frightening me."
199210,L281457,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,"No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours."
199211,L281456,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Is that it?
199212,L281455,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,"I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise."
199213,L281443,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
199214,L281442,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,You sure?
199215,L281441,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,No.
199216,L281440,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
199217,L281439,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,No.
199218,L281438,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
199219,L281437,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,She was a good woman.
199220,L281435,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,And Brenda?
199221,L281434,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Around.
199222,L281433,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Where have you been for the last seven years?
199223,L281432,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,No.  I don't scare easy.
199224,L281431,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
199225,L281430,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Central Park.
199226,L281429,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
199227,L281428,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I already told you.  I took a walk.
199228,L281427,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Where were you last night around nine?
199229,L281425,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,"That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you."
199230,L281424,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,A few days ago.
199231,L281423,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,When did you get back?
199232,L281420,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Congratulations.
199233,L281419,u5849,m388,BEDSOE,Lieutenant.
199234,L281418,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Detective Bedsoe.
199235,L281626,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,No -- after you.
199236,L281625,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,You can go first.
199237,L281619,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,You always get to go first.
199238,L281618,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,That doesn't matter.
199239,L281617,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,I stood up first.
199240,L281616,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,No -- I will.
199241,L281615,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,I'll go first.
199242,L281602,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,It's done.
199243,L281601,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,Well?
199244,L281581,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
199245,L281580,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,No.  What am I to do?
199246,L281579,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
199247,L281578,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,"So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do."
199248,L281577,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
199249,L281576,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
199250,L281575,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,You.
199251,L281574,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,What worries you?
199252,L281573,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,Yes.
199253,L281562,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Then she should be an excellent dancer.
199254,L281561,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,She's the King's cousin.
199255,L281560,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,To ask her to dance.
199256,L281557,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
199257,L281556,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Living.  Remember?
199258,L281555,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,What are we doing here?
199259,L281503,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,Me?  Of course.
199260,L281502,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
199261,L281501,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,How long is the voyage?
199262,L281500,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,France.
199263,L281499,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
199264,L281498,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas."
199265,L281380,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
199266,L281379,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,If it came down to it what would you do?
199267,L281378,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,That is a thought that doesn't please me.
199268,L281377,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,"We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me."
199269,L281376,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,As friends -- always as friends.
199270,L281375,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,I'm sure they will.
199271,L281374,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
199272,L281373,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,For what?
199273,L281372,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Thank you, Thomas."
199274,L281371,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,Then it's worth the journey.
199275,L281370,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Maybe myself.
199276,L281369,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,And what do you think you will find in another land?
199277,L281368,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
199278,L281367,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,Leaving what?
199279,L281366,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I'm leaving.
199280,L281362,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
199281,L281361,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,That is what bothers me.
199282,L281360,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,"Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one."
199283,L281359,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Yes.
199284,L281358,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,That's all?
199285,L281357,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,The river.
199286,L281356,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,What else?  What else do you hear right now?
199287,L281355,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I hear you.
199288,L281354,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,"Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear."
199289,L281353,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,You?
199290,L281352,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
199291,L281351,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Can't you enjoy it quietly?
199292,L281350,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
199293,L281349,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Sing.
199294,L281348,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,What?
199295,L281347,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Must you do that?
199296,L281311,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more."
199297,L281310,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,"You cannot run from your destiny, Conner."
199298,L281308,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,"Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day."
199299,L281307,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
199300,L281306,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
199301,L281305,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
199302,L281297,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
199303,L281296,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I learned my fill from Romeriz.
199304,L281295,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
199305,L281294,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Who are you?
199306,L281293,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,"We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think."
199307,L281292,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
199308,L281291,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,You?
199309,L281290,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Aye.
199310,L281289,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
199311,L281288,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,Caution shows wisdom.
199312,L281287,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile."
199313,L281286,u5851,m388,CAVANAUGH,"You'll have no need for that, Highlander."
199314,L281250,u5853,m388,FARMER,How?
199315,L281249,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I would like to say goodbye.
199316,L281248,u5853,m388,FARMER,Agreed.
199317,L281247,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come."
199318,L281246,u5853,m388,FARMER,This cannot be.
199319,L281238,u5853,m388,FARMER,I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
199320,L281237,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me."
199321,L281236,u5853,m388,FARMER,She'll soon be of age.
199322,L281235,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,She's a treasure she is.
199323,L281234,u5853,m388,FARMER,"I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner."
199324,L281231,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I think you just like to eat dirt.
199325,L281230,u5853,m388,FARMER,What do you think?
199326,L281229,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Can you really tell from doing that?
199327,L281228,u5853,m388,FARMER,It will be a good harvest this year.
199328,L281188,u5854,m388,HOODED MAN,I lied.
199329,L281187,u5868,m388,VIEIRA,We had a bargain.  You promised.
199330,L281180,u5868,m388,VIEIRA,How?
199331,L281179,u5854,m388,HOODED MAN,Your life.
199332,L281178,u5868,m388,VIEIRA,And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
199333,L281177,u5854,m388,HOODED MAN,I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
199334,L281176,u5854,m388,HOODED MAN,Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
199335,L281175,u5868,m388,VIEIRA,How comes it your are not afraid?
199336,L281597,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained."
199337,L281596,u5855,m388,ISABELLE,Why are you doing this?
199338,L281595,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Where I'm going you cannot follow.
199339,L281594,u5855,m388,ISABELLE,Then take me with you.
199340,L281593,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Aye.
199341,L281592,u5855,m388,ISABELLE,"Do you love me, Conner?"
199342,L281591,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I cannot explain.
199343,L281590,u5855,m388,ISABELLE,Why?
199344,L281589,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,You'll no see me again.
199345,L281588,u5855,m388,ISABELLE,Leaving?  For how long?
199346,L281587,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I'm leaving in the morning.
199347,L281586,u5855,m388,ISABELLE,Why not?
199348,L281585,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I cannot stay.
199349,L281570,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
199350,L281569,u5855,m388,ISABELLE,Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
199351,L281568,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Sometimes.
199352,L281567,u5855,m388,ISABELLE,The past?
199353,L281566,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Different places.
199354,L281565,u5855,m388,ISABELLE,Where do you go when your mind drifts?
199355,L281564,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Aye?
199356,L281277,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.
199357,L281276,u5864,m388,REPORTER,No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
199358,L281275,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,"You guys are from the British museum, right?"
199359,L281274,u5864,m388,REPORTER,What are you hoping to find inside?
199360,L281273,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Huge.
199361,L281272,u5864,m388,REPORTER,Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
199362,L281271,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
199363,L281822,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Sounds very -- normal.
199364,L281821,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
199365,L281820,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,What now?
199366,L281802,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Conner?
199367,L281801,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,"Be careful, Conner."
199368,L281800,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Get out.
199369,L281799,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,He's in there!
199370,L281782,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,He will not stop until it is over.
199371,L281781,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Must you fight him?
199372,L281780,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,It will end tonight.
199373,L281779,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Where will you go now?
199374,L281778,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
199375,L281777,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,And the other one -- he is like you?
199376,L281776,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
199377,L281772,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,You?
199378,L281771,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be."
199379,L281770,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,How did you know that?
199380,L281769,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
199381,L281768,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,On the back it has--
199382,L281767,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I've seen it.
199383,L281766,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Would you like to see it?
199384,L281761,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Not unless they're immortal.
199385,L281760,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
199386,L281759,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,--for three hundred years.
199387,L281758,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
199388,L281757,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
199389,L281756,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
199390,L281755,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
199391,L281754,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,So?
199392,L281753,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,"Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall."
199393,L281752,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,You don't really believe this do you?
199394,L281751,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
199395,L281750,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Why not?
199396,L281749,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,No.
199397,L281748,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
199398,L281741,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Why don't you tell me.
199399,L281740,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
199400,L281739,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
199401,L281738,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Yes -- it is.
199402,L281737,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Is it?
199403,L281736,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
199404,L281735,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,That makes you uncomfortable?
199405,L281734,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I wanted to get to know you better.
199406,L281733,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,How come you wanted to meet tonight?
199407,L281732,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
199408,L281731,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,You're not an easy person to get to know.
199409,L281730,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I've lived all over the world.
199410,L281729,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,I'm just trying to place you.
199411,L281728,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Why?
199412,L281727,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
199413,L281726,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I know.
199414,L281725,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,You didn't answer my question.
199415,L281721,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Sorry.
199416,L281720,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,You're twenty minutes late.
199417,L281719,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Good evening.
199418,L281705,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
199419,L281704,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Why?
199420,L281703,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Meet me Tratino's at nine.
199421,L281702,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Yes.
199422,L281700,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,You look like you have.
199423,L281699,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,No.
199424,L281698,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Have you ever heard of the Calan?
199425,L281697,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I'm interested in mythology.
199426,L281696,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
199427,L281695,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,About what?
199428,L281694,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
199429,L281693,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,New York is dangerous place.
199430,L281692,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Do you always walk around with a sword?
199431,L281691,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Then how did he know your name?
199432,L281690,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I don't know.
199433,L281689,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Who was that man last night?
199434,L281688,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I don't have any answers for you.
199435,L281686,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,You remind me of someone I used to know.
199436,L281685,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Why do you stare at me like that?
199437,L281684,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Jennifer.
199438,L281683,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman."
199439,L281652,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I don't know anymore.
199440,L281651,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Then who's Russell Nash?
199441,L281650,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Because it's my name.
199442,L281649,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
199443,L281648,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I'll be fine.
199444,L281647,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,You're hurt.
199445,L281549,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,"It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother."
199446,L281548,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Where did you get it?
199447,L281546,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Why?  What's going on?
199448,L281545,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
199449,L281544,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,If it's good advice.
199450,L281543,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?"
199451,L281542,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
199452,L281541,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,You got me.
199453,L281540,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
199454,L281539,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
199455,L281538,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,"I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?"
199456,L281537,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,A lucky guess.
199457,L281536,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Yes.  How did you know?
199458,L281535,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,In the highlands?
199459,L281534,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
199460,L281533,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Corpses?
199461,L281531,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman."
199462,L281530,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,To talk to you.
199463,L281529,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,What do you want?
199464,L281528,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,No.  I'm an archaeologist.
199465,L281527,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Are you a cop?
199466,L281526,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,I was wondering if I could talk to you?
199467,L281525,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I remember you.
199468,L281524,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
199469,L281393,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,We'll see.
199470,L281392,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
199471,L281391,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,I like my work.
199472,L281390,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
199473,L281389,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,"I know, Paul."
199474,L281388,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,"Jennifer, there is more to life than work."
199475,L281387,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,I was working on the cataloging.
199476,L281386,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,You stayed here again last night?
199477,L281328,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,And this?
199478,L281327,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,It has to be.
199479,L281326,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,I don't think it is a duplication.
199480,L281325,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
199481,L281323,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,His head.  Someone cut it off.
199482,L281322,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,What's that next to him?
199483,L281321,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,We found him this morning.
199484,L281320,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,I don't know.
199485,L281319,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,How could they get by him?
199486,L281318,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
199487,L281316,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,What?  How?
199488,L281315,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Someone broke into the cavern last night.
199489,L281314,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,Why?
199490,L281313,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,We're holding the workers down below.
199491,L281281,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
199492,L281280,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
199493,L281279,u5856,m388,JENNIFER,Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
199494,L281278,u5862,m388,PROFESSOR DAJORSKI,Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
199495,L281202,u5857,m388,KILVARA,Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
199496,L281201,u5861,m388,OLD MAN,It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
199497,L281200,u5857,m388,KILVARA,Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
199498,L281198,u5857,m388,KILVARA,I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
199499,L281197,u5861,m388,OLD MAN,I do not know -- and even if I did...
199500,L281196,u5857,m388,KILVARA,Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
199501,L281195,u5861,m388,OLD MAN,It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
199502,L281194,u5857,m388,KILVARA,"It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?"
199503,L281643,u5857,m388,KILVARA,You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
199504,L281642,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,It will not end tonight.
199505,L281641,u5857,m388,KILVARA,"It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod."
199506,L281640,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Why did you wait?
199507,L281639,u5857,m388,KILVARA,Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
199508,L281637,u5857,m388,KILVARA,The Kurgan was a pussy.
199509,L281636,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,That's what the Kurgan said.
199510,L281635,u5857,m388,KILVARA,"I am stronger than you, Highlander."
199511,L281634,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,This cannot be.
199512,L281633,u5857,m388,KILVARA,Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
199513,L281227,u5858,m388,MACLEOD,Me too.
199514,L281226,u5863,m388,RACHEL,"I'm glad you've come home, Conner."
199515,L281225,u5858,m388,MACLEOD,No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
199516,L281224,u5863,m388,RACHEL,Is there anything else you need?
199517,L281223,u5858,m388,MACLEOD,I don't know.
199518,L281222,u5863,m388,RACHEL,How can that be?
199519,L281221,u5858,m388,MACLEOD,No.
199520,L281220,u5863,m388,RACHEL,"It isn't over, is it, Conner?"
199521,L281216,u5858,m388,MACLEOD,I can take care of myself.
199522,L281215,u5863,m388,RACHEL,The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
199523,L281214,u5858,m388,MACLEOD,I know.
199524,L281213,u5863,m388,RACHEL,You know it's not safe here for you.
199525,L281258,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
199526,L281257,u5866,m388,SARAH,I'll no forget you.
199527,L281256,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more."
199528,L281255,u5866,m388,SARAH,"I love you, Conner."
199529,L281254,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to."
199530,L281253,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,It's not for me to decide.
199531,L281252,u5866,m388,SARAH,"Don't leave us, Conner."
199532,L281233,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Aye -- that I would, lass."
199533,L281232,u5866,m388,SARAH,"Would you care for some water, Conner?"
199534,L281664,u5863,m388,RACHEL,"If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done."
199535,L281663,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do."
199536,L281662,u5863,m388,RACHEL,And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
199537,L281661,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
199538,L281660,u5863,m388,RACHEL,"Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live."
199539,L281659,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,My dreams died long ago.
199540,L281658,u5863,m388,RACHEL,Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
199541,L281656,u5863,m388,RACHEL,"You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived."
199542,L281655,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
199543,L281654,u5863,m388,RACHEL,Why?
199544,L281653,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,"I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't."
199545,L281554,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
199546,L281553,u5863,m388,RACHEL,What will you do?
199547,L281552,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Fine.
199548,L281551,u5863,m388,RACHEL,I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
199549,L281415,u5863,m388,RACHEL,Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
199550,L281414,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
199551,L281413,u5863,m388,RACHEL,Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
199552,L281412,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
199553,L281411,u5863,m388,RACHEL,What are you doing?
199554,L281333,u5863,m388,RACHEL,Yes.
199555,L281332,u5859,m388,MCCLEOD,You kept it?
199556,L281403,u5867,m388,TELLER,Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
199557,L281402,u5860,m388,MR. PARKER,I can take care of myself.
199558,L281401,u5867,m388,TELLER,This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
199559,L281400,u5860,m388,MR. PARKER,"No.  The money, please."
199560,L281399,u5867,m388,TELLER,Would you like to deposit this in your account?
199561,L281398,u5860,m388,MR. PARKER,Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
199562,L281397,u5867,m388,TELLER,"Good afternoon, Mr. Parker."
199563,L287982,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Get to work.
199564,L287981,u5869,m389,ANDERS,"I will, Chief.  Absolutely."
199565,L287980,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
199566,L287979,u5869,m389,ANDERS,I guess so.
199567,L287978,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?"
199568,L287977,u5869,m389,ANDERS,"Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief."
199569,L287769,u5869,m389,ANDERS,"Yes, sir."
199570,L287768,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house."
199571,L287609,u5869,m389,ANDERS,"The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside."
199572,L287608,u5891,m389,TALLEY,That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
199573,L287607,u5869,m389,ANDERS,"The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas."
199574,L287553,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away."
199575,L287552,u5869,m389,ANDERS,I think he's dead!
199576,L287551,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?"
199577,L288051,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Keep trying.
199578,L288050,u5870,m389,ANDERS' VOICE,Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
199579,L288049,u5891,m389,TALLEY,You get anything on Smith?
199580,L288048,u5870,m389,ANDERS' VOICE,It was stolen.
199581,L288047,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
199582,L288046,u5870,m389,ANDERS' VOICE,The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
199583,L288045,u5891,m389,TALLEY,What'd you find out?
199584,L288044,u5870,m389,ANDERS' VOICE,"It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?"
199585,L288043,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Talley.
199586,L288336,u5871,m389,BELDONE,I'll make the call.
199587,L288335,u5873,m389,CASTELLANO,I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
199588,L288334,u5871,m389,BELDONE,I understand.
199589,L288333,u5873,m389,CASTELLANO,"Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses."
199590,L288332,u5871,m389,BELDONE,The best.
199591,L288331,u5873,m389,CASTELLANO,"Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?"
199592,L288330,u5871,m389,BELDONE,What do you want to do?
199593,L288329,u5873,m389,CASTELLANO,"I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan."
199594,L288328,u5871,m389,BELDONE,"Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat."
199595,L288327,u5873,m389,CASTELLANO,"And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization."
199596,L288326,u5871,m389,BELDONE,You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out.
199597,L288325,u5873,m389,CASTELLANO,"Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck."
199598,L288324,u5871,m389,BELDONE,"The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood."
199599,L287726,u5895,m389,TUZEE,It's happening right now.
199600,L287725,u5872,m389,BENZA,"Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him."
199601,L287722,u5872,m389,BENZA,Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
199602,L287721,u5895,m389,TUZEE,He knows better than that.
199603,L287720,u5872,m389,BENZA,Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
199604,L287719,u5872,m389,BENZA,"<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this."

199606,L287708,u5895,m389,TUZEE,I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
199607,L287707,u5872,m389,BENZA,Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
199608,L287706,u5895,m389,TUZEE,"Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go."
199609,L287717,u5872,m389,BENZA,"No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there."
199610,L287716,u5876,m389,FISCHER,"If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know."
199611,L287715,u5872,m389,BENZA,"What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?"
199612,L287712,u5872,m389,BENZA,"I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?"

199614,L287710,u5872,m389,BENZA,You think we should take that chance?
199615,L287709,u5876,m389,FISCHER,"Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?"
199616,L287605,u5896,m389,WALTER,You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.

199639,L288173,u5881,m389,KEVIN,That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
199640,L288172,u5874,m389,DENNIS,The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
199641,L288171,u5881,m389,KEVIN,What are you talking about?
199642,L288170,u5874,m389,DENNIS,"If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive."

199651,L287852,u5874,m389,DENNIS,Not if they're looking at something else.
199652,L287851,u5881,m389,KEVIN,"That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us."
199653,L287850,u5874,m389,DENNIS,These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.

199669,L287581,u5881,m389,KEVIN,We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
199670,L287485,u5874,m389,DENNIS,"We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one."
199671,L287484,u5881,m389,KEVIN,We're on foot.  We can't get away.
199672,L287483,u5874,m389,DENNIS,That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
199673,L287481,u5881,m389,KEVIN,What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?

199693,L288112,u5874,m389,DENNIS,Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
199694,L288111,u5891,m389,TALLEY,You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
199695,L288110,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.

199698,L288018,u5874,m389,DENNIS,You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
199699,L288017,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"If you won't let me come in, then put him outside."
199700,L288016,u5874,m389,DENNIS,Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
199701,L288015,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Let me come get him.

199703,L288013,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
199704,L288003,u5891,m389,TALLEY,We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.

199775,L287777,u5886,m389,MARS,"It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide."
199776,L287767,u5875,m389,DILL,"Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --"
199777,L287766,u5891,m389,TALLEY,You have his address?
199778,L287765,u5875,m389,DILL,"Keeps to himself, more like."
199779,L287764,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
199780,L287763,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
199781,L287762,u5875,m389,DILL,"That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too."
199782,L287761,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Can you identify this man?
199783,L288368,u5885,m389,MARION,"You fucked up, Glen."
199784,L288367,u5877,m389,HOWELL,Are you out of your mind?
199785,L287753,u5885,m389,MARION,I don't eat junk food.
199786,L287752,u5877,m389,HOWELL,Donuts here any good?
199787,L287749,u5877,m389,HOWELL,"We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him."
199788,L287748,u5885,m389,MARION,Okey-doke.
199789,L287747,u5877,m389,HOWELL,He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
199790,L287746,u5885,m389,MARION,It won't be a problem.
199791,L287745,u5877,m389,HOWELL,Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
199792,L288059,u5890,m389,SEYMORE,Canyon Country.
199793,L288058,u5877,m389,HOWELL,What hospital?
199794,L288057,u5890,m389,SEYMORE,"<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over."
199795,L288056,u5877,m389,HOWELL,"Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?"
199796,L288055,u5890,m389,SEYMORE,I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
199797,L287744,u5877,m389,HOWELL,You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
199798,L287743,u5890,m389,SEYMORE,"If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end."
199799,L287742,u5877,m389,HOWELL,What do you mean?
199800,L287741,u5890,m389,SEYMORE,What if it goes south?
199801,L287729,u5890,m389,SEYMORE,"An hour, tops.  Might be sooner."
199802,L287728,u5877,m389,HOWELL,Give me an ETA.
199803,L287727,u5890,m389,SEYMORE,L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
199804,L288364,u5877,m389,HOWELL,You'd better be kidding.
199805,L288363,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
199806,L288360,u5877,m389,HOWELL,"If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?"
199807,L288359,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
199808,L288356,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk."
199809,L288355,u5877,m389,HOWELL,All right.  Now the second one.
199810,L288353,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Close.
199811,L288352,u5877,m389,HOWELL,Where is it?
199812,L288351,u5891,m389,TALLEY,You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
199813,L288346,u5891,m389,TALLEY,You said they would be here!
199814,L288345,u5877,m389,HOWELL,They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
199815,L288344,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?"
199816,L288343,u5877,m389,HOWELL,Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
199817,L288323,u5877,m389,HOWELL,"You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find."
199818,L288322,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Yeah.
199819,L288321,u5877,m389,HOWELL,Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
199820,L288320,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I think you got no choice.
199821,L288319,u5877,m389,HOWELL,Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
199822,L288318,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade."
199823,L288317,u5877,m389,HOWELL,What do you want?
199824,L288316,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
199825,L288315,u5877,m389,HOWELL,I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
199826,L288314,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you."
199827,L288313,u5877,m389,HOWELL,How did you get this number?
199828,L287699,u5878,m389,JANE,That's okay.  I love you anyway.
199829,L287698,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I'm scared shitless.
199830,L287696,u5878,m389,JANE,I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
199831,L287695,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
199832,L287694,u5878,m389,JANE,You sure?
199833,L287693,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
199834,L287691,u5878,m389,JANE,But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
199835,L287690,u5891,m389,TALLEY,The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
199836,L287689,u5878,m389,JANE,Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
199837,L287688,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --"
199838,L287537,u5878,m389,JANE,We'll see you in a couple of hours.
199839,L287536,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Can we talk some more when you get here?
199840,L287529,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I still see that boy's eyes.
199841,L287528,u5878,m389,JANE,"You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me."
199842,L287527,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I need to work out some stuff.
199843,L288280,u5894,m389,THOMAS,I know.
199844,L288279,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
199845,L287834,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
199846,L287833,u5894,m389,THOMAS,"Shh, they'll hear you!"
199847,L287832,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,You leave that gun alone!
199848,L287830,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,"Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!"
199849,L287829,u5894,m389,THOMAS,I'm not gonna leave you!
199850,L287828,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,"You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy."
199851,L287827,u5894,m389,THOMAS,We can't carry him.
199852,L287826,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
199853,L287825,u5894,m389,THOMAS,We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
199854,L287824,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,"Mine, too."
199855,L287823,u5894,m389,THOMAS,That big asshole nailed my windows.
199856,L287822,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,No one's coming.
199857,L287821,u5894,m389,THOMAS,Be quiet!  Listen!
199858,L287820,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,Ow!  Shit!
199859,L288260,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,Stop it.
199860,L288259,u5886,m389,MARS,Now we can do whatever we want.
199861,L288258,u5886,m389,MARS,"Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone."
199862,L288257,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
199863,L288255,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,I don't know what you're talking about.
199864,L288254,u5886,m389,MARS,Kevin left without you.
199865,L287993,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,How about dog shit?
199866,L287992,u5886,m389,MARS,Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
199867,L287991,u5886,m389,MARS,We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
199868,L287990,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,What?
199869,L287989,u5886,m389,MARS,We can't make the microwave work.
199870,L287988,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,What do you want?
199871,L287635,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,What I want is to help my father.
199872,L287634,u5886,m389,MARS,Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
199873,L287633,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,I don't drink beer.
199874,L287632,u5886,m389,MARS,Want one?
199875,L288193,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,Yes.
199876,L288192,u5881,m389,KEVIN,"Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?"
199877,L288191,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,How can we get out?
199878,L288190,u5881,m389,KEVIN,"All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this."
199879,L288189,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,I can't go without Thomas.
199880,L288188,u5881,m389,KEVIN,Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
199881,L288187,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,What happened?
199882,L288186,u5881,m389,KEVIN,Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
199883,L288185,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,What do you want?
199884,L287807,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
199885,L287806,u5881,m389,KEVIN,He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
199886,L287805,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,"Kevin, my father needs a doctor."
199887,L287804,u5881,m389,KEVIN,Whatever.
199888,L287803,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,Thanks for the shirt.
199889,L287802,u5881,m389,KEVIN,Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
199890,L287801,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
199891,L287800,u5881,m389,KEVIN,You gotta pee?
199892,L287630,u5881,m389,KEVIN,Mars?  What are you doing?
199893,L287629,u5879,m389,JENNIFER,Please get away from me.
199894,L288138,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
199895,L288137,u5880,m389,JORGENSON,What's going on?
199896,L287556,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Keep your head down.
199897,L287555,u5880,m389,JORGENSON,What are we going to do about Mike?
199898,L287554,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses."
199899,L287550,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Holster your guns!
199900,L287549,u5880,m389,JORGENSON,He said something about a girl --
199901,L287548,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Are civilians inside?
199902,L288156,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Another minute.  Please --
199903,L288155,u5882,m389,KLAUS,That's enough.
199904,L288151,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I need to talk to him.  Alone.
199905,L288150,u5882,m389,KLAUS,Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
199906,L288149,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay."
199907,L288041,u5882,m389,KLAUS,He.  Can't.  Answer.
199908,L288040,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Just one question.  Please.
199909,L288039,u5882,m389,KLAUS,I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
199910,L288034,u5882,m389,KLAUS,What are you doing?!  Stop that!
199911,L288033,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Smith!  Wake up!
199912,L288032,u5882,m389,KLAUS,Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
199913,L288031,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
199914,L287916,u5883,m389,LOUISE,"His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house."
199915,L287915,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!"
199916,L287914,u5883,m389,LOUISE,We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
199917,L287913,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Is something wrong with Jane?
199918,L287580,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
199919,L287579,u5883,m389,LOUISE,"What's that, Chief?  Say again."
199920,L287578,u5891,m389,TALLEY,That's not enough.
199921,L287544,u5883,m389,LOUISE,York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
199922,L287543,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Where are they?
199923,L287542,u5883,m389,LOUISE,Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
199924,L287541,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?"
199925,L287912,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Stand by.
199926,L287911,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
199927,L287910,u5891,m389,TALLEY,What's wrong with the radio?
199928,L287909,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
199929,L287908,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Did you find Jane and Mandy?
199930,L287899,u5891,m389,TALLEY,They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
199931,L287898,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,She didn't answer.
199932,L287897,u5891,m389,TALLEY,You have her cell number?
199933,L287896,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
199934,L287895,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Go.
199935,L287894,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,"Chief, base."
199936,L287775,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Tell her I'm almost home.
199937,L287774,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,I know the one.
199938,L287773,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
199939,L287772,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,"Go, Chief."
199940,L287771,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Louise?
199941,L287612,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Get a phone number for the Smiths.
199942,L287611,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,"Go, Chief."
199943,L287610,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Louise?
199944,L287577,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,"We only have eight officers on duty, Chief."
199945,L287576,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there."
199946,L287575,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
199947,L287570,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?"
199948,L287569,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,He didn't say.
199949,L287568,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Did he say if she was shooting at him?
199950,L287567,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
199951,L287562,u5884,m389,LOUISE'S VOICE,Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
199952,L287561,u5891,m389,TALLEY,One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
199953,L288236,u5887,m389,MARTIN,Goddamned small town bullshit.
199954,L288235,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Let it go, Captain."
199955,L288084,u5887,m389,MARTIN,"-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?"
199956,L288083,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!"
199957,L288082,u5887,m389,MARTIN,"I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --"
199958,L288081,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
199959,L288080,u5887,m389,MARTIN,I want to know what in hell you're doing.
199960,L287985,u5891,m389,TALLEY,And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
199961,L287984,u5887,m389,MARTIN,Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
199962,L287940,u5887,m389,MARTIN,"You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call."
199963,L287939,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"You want me to stick around, I could --"
199964,L287938,u5887,m389,MARTIN,Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
199965,L287937,u5891,m389,TALLEY,No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
199966,L287936,u5887,m389,MARTIN,Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
199967,L287935,u5891,m389,TALLEY,They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
199968,L287934,u5887,m389,MARTIN,"If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in."
199969,L287933,u5891,m389,TALLEY,He says that his father's hurt.
199970,L287893,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"That's why you get the big bucks, Captain."
199971,L287892,u5887,m389,MARTIN,Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
199972,L287891,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up."
199973,L287890,u5887,m389,MARTIN,Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
199974,L287889,u5891,m389,TALLEY,He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
199975,L287870,u5887,m389,MARTIN,Order your men to stand down.
199976,L287869,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him."
199977,L287844,u5887,m389,MARTIN,Maddox!  You got that?
199978,L287843,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him."
199979,L287842,u5887,m389,MARTIN,Sounds like you know the job.
199980,L287841,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
199981,L287840,u5887,m389,MARTIN,Do it.
199982,L287836,u5887,m389,MARTIN,"Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --"
199983,L287835,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
199984,L288243,u5888,m389,MIKKELSON'S VOICE,"Yes, sir."
199985,L288242,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait."
199986,L288239,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Go, Mickey."
199987,L288238,u5888,m389,MIKKELSON'S VOICE,"Chief, it's Mikkelson."
199988,L288237,u5891,m389,TALLEY,It's mine.  Talley.
199989,L287616,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy."
199990,L287615,u5888,m389,MIKKELSON'S VOICE,"The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address."
199991,L287614,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Go, Mickey."
199992,L287613,u5888,m389,MIKKELSON'S VOICE,"Chief, Mikkelson."
199993,L287574,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
199994,L287573,u5888,m389,MIKKELSON'S VOICE,It's right in front of us.
199995,L287572,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
199996,L287571,u5888,m389,MIKKELSON'S VOICE,"We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer."
199997,L288294,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!"
199998,L288293,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,Where's the office?
199999,L288292,u5891,m389,TALLEY,The kids are in here!
200000,L288286,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,They've been in there all day.
200001,L288285,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
200002,L288284,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,Not until the man calls.
200003,L288283,u5891,m389,TALLEY,We've got to get those kids out of there!
200004,L288219,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?"
200005,L288218,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,"You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move."
200006,L288217,u5891,m389,TALLEY,What are you people going to do?
200007,L288216,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
200008,L288215,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Special Agent Jones.
200009,L288214,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
200010,L288213,u5891,m389,TALLEY,What?
200011,L288212,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,What's my name?
200012,L288211,u5891,m389,TALLEY,How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
200013,L288210,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,Don't worry about what we used to be.
200014,L288209,u5891,m389,TALLEY,You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
200015,L288208,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
200016,L288207,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,"Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it."
200017,L288206,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Are all of you named Jones?
200018,L288205,u5889,m389,MR. JONES,"Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones."
200019,L288299,u5894,m389,THOMAS,No!  They're right here --
200020,L288298,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Are the disks still in your room?
200021,L288132,u5894,m389,THOMAS,Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
200022,L288131,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Who is it?
200023,L288130,u5894,m389,THOMAS,Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
200024,L288129,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
200025,L288128,u5894,m389,THOMAS,I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
200026,L288127,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
200027,L288126,u5894,m389,THOMAS,I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
200028,L288125,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Can you open them?
200029,L288079,u5894,m389,THOMAS,"Yes, sir."
200030,L288078,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?"
200031,L288077,u5894,m389,THOMAS,I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
200032,L288076,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Can you get into the office?
200033,L288075,u5894,m389,THOMAS,I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
200034,L288074,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I thought they locked you in your room.
200035,L288073,u5894,m389,THOMAS,But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
200036,L288072,u5894,m389,THOMAS,Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
200037,L288071,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?"
200038,L288070,u5894,m389,THOMAS,He has lots of disks.
200039,L288069,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
200040,L288068,u5894,m389,THOMAS,What do you want me to do?
200041,L288067,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt."
200042,L288066,u5894,m389,THOMAS,Okay.
200043,L288065,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?"
200044,L288064,u5894,m389,THOMAS,I think so.
200045,L288063,u5891,m389,TALLEY,The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
200046,L288062,u5894,m389,THOMAS,Is my daddy okay?
200047,L287930,u5894,m389,THOMAS,"If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --"
200048,L287929,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you."
200049,L287928,u5894,m389,THOMAS,They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
200050,L287927,u5891,m389,TALLEY,That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
200051,L287926,u5894,m389,THOMAS,In my room.
200052,L287925,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Where are you right now?
200053,L287924,u5894,m389,THOMAS,We're okay.
200054,L287923,u5891,m389,TALLEY,How about you and your sister?
200055,L287922,u5894,m389,THOMAS,Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
200056,L287921,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?"
200057,L287920,u5894,m389,THOMAS,Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
200058,L287919,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son."
200059,L288310,u5891,m389,TALLEY,How do I reach him?
200060,L288309,u5896,m389,WALTER,That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
200061,L288308,u5891,m389,TALLEY,A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
200062,L288307,u5896,m389,WALTER,Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
200063,L288306,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Yes.
200064,L288305,u5896,m389,WALTER,Did you find the disks?
200065,L288154,u5891,m389,TALLEY,He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
200066,L288153,u5896,m389,WALTER,I don't know what you're talking about.
200067,L288148,u5891,m389,TALLEY,They're still in the house.
200068,L288147,u5896,m389,WALTER,Where are my children?
200069,L287969,u5892,m389,THE WATCHMAN,Smith will know.
200070,L287968,u5891,m389,TALLEY,These disks . . . where are they?
200071,L287967,u5892,m389,THE WATCHMAN,"I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?"
200072,L287966,u5891,m389,TALLEY,You want . . . Marlon and Al.
200073,L287965,u5892,m389,THE WATCHMAN,"When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family."
200074,L287964,u5892,m389,THE WATCHMAN,"You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team."
200075,L287963,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
200076,L287962,u5892,m389,THE WATCHMAN,We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
200077,L287961,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Marlon and Al....
200078,L287959,u5891,m389,TALLEY,You can let go.
200079,L287958,u5892,m389,THE WATCHMAN,"Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?"
200080,L287953,u5892,m389,THE WATCHMAN,These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
200081,L287952,u5891,m389,TALLEY,What do you want?
200082,L287951,u5892,m389,THE WATCHMAN,"Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?"
200083,L287949,u5892,m389,THE WATCHMAN,Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
200084,L287948,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Who are you?
200085,L287947,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
200086,L287946,u5892,m389,THE WATCHMAN,Where's your gun?
200087,L288167,u5893,m389,THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE,You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
200088,L288166,u5891,m389,TALLEY,What do you mean by that?
200089,L288165,u5893,m389,THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE,"We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A."
200090,L288164,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Your phony FBI assholes.
200091,L288163,u5893,m389,THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE,My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
200092,L288162,u5891,m389,TALLEY,I guess we do.
200093,L288161,u5893,m389,THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE,I guess we each have something the other wants.
200094,L288160,u5891,m389,TALLEY,"I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!"
200095,L288159,u5893,m389,THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE,<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
200096,L288158,u5891,m389,TALLEY,Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
200097,L288157,u5893,m389,THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE,"You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!"
200098,L289047,u5897,m390,BENEDICT,A delegation.
200099,L289046,u5909,m390,PAUL,"We, who is we?"
200100,L289045,u5897,m390,BENEDICT,"Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office."
200101,L288825,u5897,m390,BENEDICT,They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
200102,L288824,u5909,m390,PAUL,What happened?
200103,L288440,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I'm sorry, it's a private function."
200104,L288439,u5897,m390,BENEDICT,Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
200105,L288438,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Yes, Benedict, what can I do?"
200106,L288437,u5897,m390,BENEDICT,"Paul, Paul, a moment please."
200107,L288725,u5909,m390,PAUL,I'll be back.
200108,L288724,u5898,m390,BIK,Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
200109,L288477,u5909,m390,PAUL,Of course.
200110,L288476,u5898,m390,BIK,"Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?"
200111,L288475,u5909,m390,PAUL,Leave it to me.
200112,L288474,u5898,m390,BIK,"The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?"
200113,L288473,u5909,m390,PAUL,Excuse me?
200114,L288472,u5898,m390,BIK,That's what I came to talk to you about.
200115,L288471,u5909,m390,PAUL,"No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis."
200116,L288469,u5898,m390,BIK,Cockroaches?
200117,L288468,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?"
200118,L288419,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me."
200119,L288418,u5898,m390,BIK,Paul!
200120,L288729,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
200121,L288728,u5909,m390,PAUL,Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
200122,L288718,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside."
200123,L288717,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
200124,L288716,u5909,m390,PAUL,I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
200125,L288715,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,Give me it.
200126,L288714,u5909,m390,PAUL,I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
200127,L288713,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,And four children?
200128,L288712,u5909,m390,PAUL,Ten.
200129,L288701,u5909,m390,PAUL,Six.
200130,L288700,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,How many in your family?
200131,L288699,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines."
200132,L288697,u5909,m390,PAUL,I don't have that much.
200133,L288696,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,Ten thousand francs for each one.
200134,L288695,u5909,m390,PAUL,Name a price.
200135,L288694,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,How much?
200136,L288693,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?"
200137,L288692,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,You want to pay me?
200138,L288689,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,There is nothing to it.
200139,L288688,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Please, I don't use guns."
200140,L288686,u5909,m390,PAUL,Let me explain.
200141,L288685,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
200142,L288671,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,Where is your family?
200143,L288670,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here."
200144,L288669,u5909,m390,PAUL,Of course.
200145,L288668,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
200146,L288667,u5909,m390,PAUL,I used to work at the Diplomat.
200147,L288666,u5909,m390,PAUL,No. I work at the Mille Collines.
200148,L288665,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
200149,L288664,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Yes, it is a calamity for us all."
200150,L288663,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
200151,L288662,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,Let me see your identity card.
200152,L288661,u5909,m390,PAUL,What is this about?
200153,L288660,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,We are looking for you.
200154,L288659,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu."
200155,L288658,u5899,m390,CAPTAIN,Who are you?
200156,L288801,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"We're awaiting a decision, excuse me."
200157,L288800,u5903,m390,GLORIA,What was the response?
200158,L288799,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,Yes we have.
200159,L288798,u5903,m390,GLORIA,Have you requested re-enforcements?
200160,L288797,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
200161,L288796,u5903,m390,GLORIA,If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
200162,L288795,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role."
200163,L288794,u5903,m390,GLORIA,We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
200164,L288793,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
200165,L288792,u5903,m390,GLORIA,Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
200166,L289294,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out."
200167,L289293,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise."
200168,L289292,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now."
200169,L289291,u5909,m390,PAUL,I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
200170,L289290,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it."
200171,L289280,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
200172,L289279,u5909,m390,PAUL,What is it?
200173,L289276,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"I can't, I don't have the men."
200174,L289275,u5909,m390,PAUL,Will you protect us.
200175,L289274,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
200176,L289273,u5909,m390,PAUL,I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
200177,L289272,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
200178,L289271,u5909,m390,PAUL,They fired a rocket at us.
200179,L288886,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,They're only taking the whites.
200180,L288885,u5909,m390,PAUL,Their people?
200181,L288884,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people."
200182,L288883,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing."
200183,L288882,u5909,m390,PAUL,I don't understand.
200184,L288881,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless."
200185,L288880,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Excuse me, Colonel."
200186,L288879,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
200187,L288878,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all."
200188,L288877,u5909,m390,PAUL,Canadian Club?
200189,L288876,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,Anything. Strong.
200190,L288830,u5909,m390,PAUL,Where is she?
200191,L288829,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
200192,L288828,u5909,m390,PAUL,What's happening?
200193,L288827,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver"
200194,L288804,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them."
200195,L288803,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?"
200196,L288802,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room."
200197,L288782,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you."
200198,L288781,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance."
200199,L288780,u5900,m390,COLONEL OLIVER,"Paul, you know who this is?"
200200,L289344,u5909,m390,PAUL,I will do nothing unless you help me now.
200201,L289343,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,You will tell them the truth.
200202,L289342,u5909,m390,PAUL,You think they will believe you?
200203,L289341,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,I led no massacres.
200204,L289340,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres."
200205,L289339,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,I committed no war crimes.
200206,L289338,u5909,m390,PAUL,"If you do not help me, you will stay on that list."
200207,L289337,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,You lie.
200208,L289336,u5909,m390,PAUL,"When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists."
200209,L289335,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,I am on a list! What list?
200210,L289334,u5909,m390,PAUL,"The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list."
200211,L289333,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,How so.
200212,L289332,u5909,m390,PAUL,You are a marked man.
200213,L289331,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Listen, you need me."
200214,L289330,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,We are better here.
200215,L289328,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
200216,L289327,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I do not want to go to Gitarama, General."
200217,L289326,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
200218,L289325,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate."
200219,L289324,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,"Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them."
200220,L289323,u5909,m390,PAUL,I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
200221,L289322,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,"Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?"
200222,L289321,u5909,m390,PAUL,"No, sir."
200223,L289320,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
200224,L289319,u5909,m390,PAUL,No.
200225,L289318,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,You know what the Scottish call it?
200226,L289313,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,Today.
200227,L289312,u5909,m390,PAUL,When?
200228,L289311,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
200229,L289310,u5909,m390,PAUL,"What do you mean, General?"
200230,L289309,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
200231,L289308,u5909,m390,PAUL,Where are they going?
200232,L289307,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
200233,L289306,u5909,m390,PAUL,Your police are at the gate?
200234,L289305,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,Get in.
200235,L289304,u5909,m390,PAUL,We must go to the Diplomat.
200236,L289303,u5909,m390,PAUL,Bring back your policemen...
200237,L289302,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,I'll be over.
200238,L289301,u5909,m390,PAUL,"The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you."
200239,L289300,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,Whiskey?
200240,L289299,u5909,m390,PAUL,"General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies."
200241,L289250,u5909,m390,PAUL,No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
200242,L289249,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
200243,L289248,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty."
200244,L289247,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,Where are my supplies?
200245,L289225,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio."
200246,L289224,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,You said you had no whiskey.
200247,L289223,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey."
200248,L289041,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one."
200249,L289040,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,"I am strong, Paul, like a lion."
200250,L289039,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?"
200251,L289038,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,I will see what I can do.
200252,L289037,u5909,m390,PAUL,"The front gate would be best, General."
200253,L289036,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,"If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?"
200254,L289035,u5909,m390,PAUL,Well rewarded Those were his words.
200255,L289034,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,He did.
200256,L289033,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded."
200257,L289032,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,The police are very busy.
200258,L289031,u5909,m390,PAUL,I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
200259,L289026,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily."
200260,L289025,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,"The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different."
200261,L289024,u5909,m390,PAUL,"'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you."
200262,L289023,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,The high command? Our high command?
200263,L289022,u5909,m390,PAUL,"The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command."
200264,L289021,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,And what will they do with these satellites?
200265,L289020,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder."
200266,L289019,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,Satellites?
200267,L289018,u5909,m390,PAUL,Satellites.
200268,L289017,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,Watch everything? How? They are gone.
200269,L289016,u5909,m390,PAUL,The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
200270,L289015,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,What did they say?
200271,L289014,u5909,m390,PAUL,A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
200272,L289013,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,What did you overhear?
200273,L289012,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about."
200274,L289011,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,"The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?"
200275,L289010,u5909,m390,PAUL,The United Nations are still here.
200276,L289009,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,"As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul."
200277,L289008,u5909,m390,PAUL,I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
200278,L288436,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,"Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please."
200279,L288435,u5909,m390,PAUL,"It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know."
200280,L288434,u5901,m390,GENERAL BIZIMUNGU,"Paul, this scotch is exceptional."
200281,L289116,u5902,m390,GEORGE,Take the river road back. It is clear.
200282,L289115,u5909,m390,PAUL,Let's go.
200283,L289113,u5902,m390,GEORGE,Why not? We are half way there already.
200284,L289112,u5909,m390,PAUL,) You cannot kill them all.
200285,L289111,u5902,m390,GEORGE,Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
200286,L289110,u5909,m390,PAUL,What do you mean George?
200287,L289109,u5902,m390,GEORGE,"No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul."
200288,L289108,u5909,m390,PAUL,You have no whiskey?
200289,L289107,u5902,m390,GEORGE,"Beer yes, but no whiskey."
200290,L289106,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey."
200291,L289105,u5902,m390,GEORGE,"Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?"
200292,L288407,u5909,m390,PAUL,At least.
200293,L288406,u5902,m390,GEORGE,"A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar."
200294,L288402,u5902,m390,GEORGE,I am always glad to see you Paul.
200295,L288401,u5909,m390,PAUL,Very good.
200296,L288400,u5902,m390,GEORGE,Business is good at the hotel?
200297,L288399,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Time is money, George. We need extra beer today."
200298,L288398,u5902,m390,GEORGE,"Politics is power, Paul. And money."
200299,L288397,u5909,m390,PAUL,I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
200300,L288914,u5903,m390,GLORIA,Youre drunk.
200301,L288913,u5905,m390,JOCK,"Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?"
200302,L288912,u5903,m390,GLORIA,"Lets go, Jock."
200303,L288855,u5903,m390,GLORIA,Fuck you.
200304,L288854,u5905,m390,JOCK,"Here, have a sandwich."
200305,L288852,u5903,m390,GLORIA,Oh my God!
200306,L288851,u5905,m390,JOCK,You fucking see that!

200314,L288805,u5905,m390,JOCK,"For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it."
200315,L288847,u5909,m390,PAUL,Thank God.

200324,L289118,u5904,m390,GREGOIRE,I saw the sign.
200325,L289117,u5909,m390,PAUL,Are you sure this is the river road?
200326,L289086,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Just drive, Gregoire."
200327,L289085,u5904,m390,GREGOIRE,"The fog is too heavy, sir."
200328,L289084,u5909,m390,PAUL,"For supplies, you drive."
200329,L289083,u5904,m390,GREGOIRE,"Where are we going, sir?"
200330,L289081,u5909,m390,PAUL,Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?

200332,L289079,u5909,m390,PAUL,Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
200333,L288779,u5904,m390,GREGOIRE,"Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it."
200334,L288778,u5909,m390,PAUL,I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
200335,L288777,u5904,m390,GREGOIRE,I don't have to listen to you anymore.

200341,L288911,u5905,m390,JOCK,Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
200342,L288910,u5909,m390,PAUL,"This is a Rolex, I can't take it."
200343,L288909,u5905,m390,JOCK,"I know that, Paul. I'm sorry."
200344,L288908,u5909,m390,PAUL,I would never do that.
200345,L288907,u5905,m390,JOCK,"Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul."
200346,L288841,u5909,m390,PAUL,This goes out live?
200347,L288840,u5905,m390,JOCK,Perfect timing.
200348,L288584,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish."
200349,L288583,u5905,m390,JOCK,"Can we phone them in, Paul?"
200350,L288582,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here."
200351,L288581,u5905,m390,JOCK,Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
200352,L288555,u5905,m390,JOCK,"Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but..."
200353,L288554,u5909,m390,PAUL,Promoted. House Manager.

200360,L288972,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Call, sir?"
200361,L288971,u5906,m390,LIEUTENANT,Who did you call?
200362,L288969,u5906,m390,LIEUTENANT,"You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now."
200363,L288968,u5909,m390,PAUL,That will take time.
200364,L288967,u5906,m390,LIEUTENANT,Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
200365,L288966,u5909,m390,PAUL,The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
200366,L288965,u5906,m390,LIEUTENANT,"Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?"

200376,L289101,u5909,m390,PAUL,How much?
200377,L289100,u5907,m390,MILITIAMAN #1,No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
200378,L289099,u5909,m390,PAUL,You have our cards.
200379,L289098,u5907,m390,MILITIAMAN #1,What cards?
200380,L289097,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Our cards, please."
200381,L289096,u5907,m390,MILITIAMAN #1,What?
200382,L289095,u5909,m390,PAUL,Excuse me.
200383,L289094,u5907,m390,MILITIAMAN #1,Show me your ID
200384,L289093,u5909,m390,PAUL,He will be here.
200385,L289092,u5907,m390,MILITIAMAN #1,The commander is not here.
200386,L289091,u5909,m390,PAUL,We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
200387,L289090,u5907,m390,MILITIAMAN #1,What do you want?
200388,L289172,u5909,m390,PAUL,I will give you my house.
200389,L289171,u5908,m390,MR. GARINDI,Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
200390,L289170,u5909,m390,PAUL,How do you know?
200391,L289169,u5908,m390,MR. GARINDI,"No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead."
200392,L289168,u5909,m390,PAUL,I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
200393,L289167,u5908,m390,MR. GARINDI,It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
200394,L288863,u5908,m390,MR. GARINDI,"No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe."
200395,L288862,u5909,m390,PAUL,Was there blood?
200396,L288767,u5908,m390,MR. GARINDI,I will see what I can do.
200397,L288766,u5909,m390,PAUL,"This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful."
200398,L288765,u5908,m390,MR. GARINDI,"No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this."
200399,L288764,u5909,m390,PAUL,I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
200400,L288763,u5909,m390,PAUL,I need a great favor.
200401,L288762,u5908,m390,MR. GARINDI,"Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here."
200402,L289359,u5909,m390,PAUL,We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
200403,L289358,u5915,m390,XAVIER,"They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow."
200404,L289286,u5909,m390,PAUL,They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
200405,L289285,u5915,m390,XAVIER,This time the Militia will kill us.
200406,L289003,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Also, this is your bill for the last week."
200407,L289002,u5915,m390,XAVIER,"Pack the bags, we have to move."
200408,L289001,u5909,m390,PAUL,Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
200409,L289000,u5915,m390,XAVIER,The third floor are low class rooms.
200410,L288999,u5909,m390,PAUL,I'm going to put you on the third floor.
200411,L288998,u5915,m390,XAVIER,Move? Where to?
200412,L288997,u5909,m390,PAUL,I'm afraid you will have to move room.
200413,L288784,u5909,m390,PAUL,Of course.
200414,L288783,u5915,m390,XAVIER,I will need a suite.
200415,L289371,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Anais, it is so good to see you."
200416,L289370,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Oh, my babies."
200417,L289298,u5909,m390,PAUL,I have to go to the Diplomat.
200418,L289297,u5914,m390,TATIANA,What's wrong?
200419,L289296,u5909,m390,PAUL,"The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled."
200420,L289267,u5909,m390,PAUL,"We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump."
200421,L289266,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Please do not talk like this.
200422,L289265,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there."
200423,L289264,u5914,m390,TATIANA,What sort of plan?
200424,L289263,u5909,m390,PAUL,We have to have a plan.
200425,L289261,u5909,m390,PAUL,We are almost out of everything.
200426,L289260,u5914,m390,TATIANA,We are almost out of water.
200427,L289213,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Paul! Then another voice.
200428,L289212,u5909,m390,PAUL,I love you. Keep the children safe.
200429,L289211,u5909,m390,PAUL,I will follow on the next plane. Go.
200430,L289210,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Let me go. Children get off.
200431,L289208,u5909,m390,PAUL,I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
200432,L289207,u5914,m390,TATIANA,No! Sit down now.
200433,L289206,u5909,m390,PAUL,I have to stay.
200434,L289204,u5914,m390,TATIANA,No.
200435,L289203,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Get on the truck, Tatiana."
200436,L289202,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
200437,L289192,u5909,m390,PAUL,We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
200438,L289191,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"A little longer, Paul?"
200439,L289166,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise."
200440,L289165,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Please, please try one more time."
200441,L289164,u5909,m390,PAUL,We have to get out of here Tatiana.
200442,L289163,u5914,m390,TATIANA,I will not leave without the twins.
200443,L289151,u5914,m390,TATIANA,A Volkswagen!
200444,L289150,u5909,m390,PAUL,A Volkswagen.
200445,L289149,u5914,m390,TATIANA,I want to know.
200446,L289148,u5909,m390,PAUL,What does it matter.
200447,L289147,u5914,m390,TATIANA,What sort of car?
200448,L289146,u5909,m390,PAUL,A car.
200449,L289145,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Tell me what it was.
200450,L289144,u5909,m390,PAUL,It was substantial.
200451,L289143,u5914,m390,TATIANA,What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
200452,L289142,u5909,m390,PAUL,To be closer. So that I could marry you.
200453,L289141,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Why?
200454,L289140,u5909,m390,PAUL,I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
200455,L289139,u5914,m390,TATIANA,What?
200456,L289138,u5909,m390,PAUL,I had you transferred to Kigali.
200457,L289137,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Yes.
200458,L289136,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Yes, when you worked as the nurse."
200459,L289135,u5914,m390,TATIANA,In Ruhengeri?
200460,L289134,u5909,m390,PAUL,I have a confession. When we met...
200461,L289132,u5909,m390,PAUL,A kiss.
200462,L289131,u5914,m390,TATIANA,I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
200463,L289130,u5909,m390,PAUL,It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
200464,L289129,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?"
200465,L289078,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now."
200466,L289077,u5914,m390,TATIANA,You cannot go alone.
200467,L289076,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide."
200468,L289075,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"No, no."
200469,L289074,u5909,m390,PAUL,To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
200470,L289073,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Go out! Where?
200471,L289072,u5909,m390,PAUL,I have to go out to get food.
200472,L289070,u5909,m390,PAUL,We're running out of beer and other supplies.
200473,L289069,u5914,m390,TATIANA,What's the matter?
200474,L289068,u5909,m390,PAUL,Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
200475,L289067,u5914,m390,TATIANA,So where is the lamb?
200476,L289066,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef."
200477,L288936,u5909,m390,PAUL,Do as I say. I will be there soon.
200478,L288935,u5914,m390,TATIANA,What for Paul.
200479,L288934,u5909,m390,PAUL,Go to the roof now.
200480,L288922,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then."
200481,L288921,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please."
200482,L288920,u5909,m390,PAUL,"What are you saying, Tatsi?"
200483,L288919,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"You could leave, Paul."
200484,L288897,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis."
200485,L288896,u5914,m390,TATIANA,But who is left?
200486,L288895,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers."
200487,L288893,u5909,m390,PAUL,We have been abandoned.
200488,L288892,u5914,m390,TATIANA,What about us?
200489,L288891,u5909,m390,PAUL,They are being evacuated.
200490,L288870,u5909,m390,PAUL,No. They are not dead. Stop this.
200491,L288869,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children."
200492,L288866,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Please go back, bring the children to us."
200493,L288865,u5909,m390,PAUL,"This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope."
200494,L288836,u5909,m390,PAUL,Give him time.
200495,L288835,u5914,m390,TATIANA,He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
200496,L288834,u5909,m390,PAUL,How can we help him.
200497,L288833,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"No, Odette says he's in shock."
200498,L288832,u5909,m390,PAUL,Has Roger spoken yet?
200499,L288761,u5909,m390,PAUL,I'll try.
200500,L288760,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"No answer. Please send someone to get them, please."
200501,L288759,u5909,m390,PAUL,Any luck?
200502,L288758,u5914,m390,TATIANA,It will do just fine.
200503,L288757,u5909,m390,PAUL,This won't do.
200504,L288746,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them."
200505,L288745,u5914,m390,TATIANA,I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
200506,L288744,u5909,m390,PAUL,What!
200507,L288743,u5914,m390,TATIANA,What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
200508,L288742,u5909,m390,PAUL,Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
200509,L288706,u5909,m390,PAUL,Get in.
200510,L288705,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Paul, don't let them die."
200511,L288655,u5909,m390,PAUL,Stay with the children.
200512,L288654,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"What is it, Paul."
200513,L288640,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Where are you hurt, son?"
200514,L288639,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Oh, my God!"
200515,L288632,u5909,m390,PAUL,Dawn. Then they go.
200516,L288631,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Please, Paul, 'til first light."
200517,L288630,u5909,m390,PAUL,They know you are Tutsi!
200518,L288629,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence."
200519,L288628,u5909,m390,PAUL,Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
200520,L288627,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?"
200521,L288626,u5909,m390,PAUL,Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
200522,L288623,u5914,m390,TATIANA,I tried already. The phones do not work.
200523,L288622,u5909,m390,PAUL,I sent them home. Go and call them.
200524,L288621,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Where are Thomas and Fedens?
200525,L288618,u5909,m390,PAUL,Murdered! By whom?
200526,L288617,u5914,m390,TATIANA,The president has been murdered.
200527,L288614,u5909,m390,PAUL,Jean Baptiste!
200528,L288613,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste."
200529,L288547,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think ""Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody."" Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment."
200530,L288546,u5914,m390,TATIANA,They do not have your connections.
200531,L288545,u5909,m390,PAUL,"He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?"
200532,L288544,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor."
200533,L288543,u5909,m390,PAUL,"No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?"
200534,L288542,u5914,m390,TATIANA,You could have asked for a favor.
200535,L288541,u5909,m390,PAUL,I couldn't help.
200536,L288540,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
200537,L288536,u5914,m390,TATIANA,We must do something.
200538,L288535,u5909,m390,PAUL,No.
200539,L288533,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Please, be quiet."
200540,L288532,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
200541,L288531,u5909,m390,PAUL,What?
200542,L288530,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Do something.
200543,L288509,u5909,m390,PAUL,Homework?
200544,L288508,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy."
200545,L288492,u5914,m390,TATIANA,Of course.
200546,L288491,u5909,m390,PAUL,Let's have dinner first.
200547,L288490,u5914,m390,TATIANA,He wants your wisdom.
200548,L288489,u5909,m390,PAUL,Thomas wants advice?
200549,L288483,u5914,m390,TATIANA,"Yes, with Fedens and the children."
200550,L288482,u5909,m390,PAUL,Your brother's here?
200551,L288481,u5914,m390,TATIANA,I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
200552,L288480,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?"
200553,L288983,u5913,m390,SABENA PRESIDENT,"I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans."
200554,L288982,u5909,m390,PAUL,Why?
200555,L288981,u5913,m390,SABENA PRESIDENT,"Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen."
200556,L288980,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Thank you, sir, you saved our lives."
200557,L288979,u5913,m390,SABENA PRESIDENT,I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
200558,L288818,u5909,m390,PAUL,There is one thing I need right away.
200559,L288817,u5913,m390,SABENA PRESIDENT,"Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime."
200560,L288815,u5913,m390,SABENA PRESIDENT,"Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?"
200561,L288814,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit."
200562,L288813,u5913,m390,SABENA PRESIDENT,Can I have your name again?
200563,L289236,u5916,m390,ZOZO,"It's true, sir, the water has been turned off."
200564,L289235,u5909,m390,PAUL,What is this about no water?
200565,L289221,u5916,m390,ZOZO,As the trucks go.
200566,L289220,u5909,m390,PAUL,When?
200567,L289219,u5916,m390,ZOZO,"I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?"
200568,L289189,u5909,m390,PAUL,Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
200569,L289188,u5916,m390,ZOZO,"Thank you, sir."
200570,L289187,u5909,m390,PAUL,"You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here."
200571,L289030,u5916,m390,ZOZO,Many beers.
200572,L289029,u5909,m390,PAUL,How much beer?
200573,L289028,u5916,m390,ZOZO,"Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers."
200574,L289027,u5909,m390,PAUL,Where has all our beer gone?
200575,L288962,u5916,m390,ZOZO,The lieutenant wants the register.
200576,L288961,u5909,m390,PAUL,What are you doing?
200577,L288918,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it."
200578,L288917,u5916,m390,ZOZO,What do we do with all these people?
200579,L288812,u5916,m390,ZOZO,"Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left."
200580,L288811,u5909,m390,PAUL,Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
200581,L288771,u5909,m390,PAUL,What! Paul storms off.
200582,L288770,u5916,m390,ZOZO,He has taken the presidential suite.
200583,L288769,u5909,m390,PAUL,Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
200584,L288423,u5909,m390,PAUL,How dead?
200585,L288422,u5916,m390,ZOZO,Twelve are dead.
200586,L288411,u5916,m390,ZOZO,"Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi."
200587,L288410,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself."
200588,L288389,u5909,m390,PAUL,Many times.
200589,L288388,u5916,m390,ZOZO,You have taken business class?
200590,L288387,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates."
200591,L288386,u5916,m390,ZOZO,That is why they call it coach?
200592,L288385,u5909,m390,PAUL,It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
200593,L288384,u5916,m390,ZOZO,"What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?"
200594,L288383,u5909,m390,PAUL,"You are with me, Zozo, don't worry."
200595,L288382,u5916,m390,ZOZO,"Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there."
200596,L288381,u5909,m390,PAUL,What's wrong?
200597,L288380,u5916,m390,ZOZO,Rutaganda's place?
200598,L288960,u5910,m390,PRESIDENT,"Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back."
200599,L288959,u5909,m390,PAUL,The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
200600,L288958,u5910,m390,PRESIDENT,"Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?"
200601,L288957,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Yes, thank you Mr. President."
200602,L288956,u5910,m390,PRESIDENT,"Paul, are you there?"
200603,L288953,u5909,m390,PAUL,Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
200604,L288952,u5910,m390,PRESIDENT,The staff and guests! How many?
200605,L288951,u5909,m390,PAUL,"The staff, the guests."
200606,L288950,u5910,m390,PRESIDENT,All. What do you mean all?
200607,L288949,u5909,m390,PAUL,"I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all."
200608,L288948,u5910,m390,PRESIDENT,Out? Where are you going?
200609,L288947,u5909,m390,PAUL,We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
200610,L288946,u5910,m390,PRESIDENT,Paul. Are you alright?
200611,L288527,u5912,m390,ROGER,On the street.
200612,L288526,u5909,m390,PAUL,Where?
200613,L288525,u5912,m390,ROGER,There are soldiers.
200614,L288507,u5909,m390,PAUL,Who is this Simon?
200615,L288506,u5912,m390,ROGER,"Please, papa, I have a secret path."
200616,L288505,u5909,m390,PAUL,"No, I don't want you going on the street."
200617,L288504,u5912,m390,ROGER,Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
200618,L288503,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Why the hurry, Roger?"
200619,L288502,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Thank you, Roger."
200620,L288501,u5912,m390,ROGER,"For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you."
200621,L288753,u5909,m390,PAUL,"Go downstairs, I will help you."
200622,L288752,u5911,m390,REFUGEE,I don't know.
200623,L288751,u5909,m390,PAUL,What is his room number?
200624,L288750,u5911,m390,REFUGEE,I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
200625,L288749,u5909,m390,PAUL,Can I help you?
200626,L288748,u5911,m390,REFUGEE,"Moses, Moses Seradungu."
200627,L291527,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"Okay: this may sound crazy, but --"
200628,L291526,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,And how the hell are we going to do that?
200629,L291525,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!"
200630,L291524,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
200631,L291523,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger."
200632,L291522,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,"It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --"
200633,L291521,u5919,m391,EVELYN,-- the whole thing is falling apart!
200634,L291520,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,-- bullshit --
200635,L291519,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --"
200636,L291518,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,"-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --"
200637,L291517,u5919,m391,EVELYN,So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
200638,L291516,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,Not yet.
200639,L291515,u5919,m391,EVELYN,-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
200640,L291514,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,It's complicated. But don't worry --
200641,L291513,u5919,m391,EVELYN,So what stopped her?
200642,L291512,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,"-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your ""demise."""
200643,L291511,u5919,m391,EVELYN,-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
200644,L291510,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,"""But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..."" well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --"
200645,L291509,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"-- ""oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"""
200646,L291508,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,"Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --"
200647,L291507,u5919,m391,EVELYN,And what's Steven's status?
200648,L291506,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
200649,L291505,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then."
200650,L291504,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,"Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary."
200651,L291203,u5919,m391,EVELYN,No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
200652,L291202,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,I'm confused.
200653,L291201,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth."
200654,L291200,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,"Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either."
200655,L291199,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't ""believe"" in divorce."
200656,L291145,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,"If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --"
200657,L291144,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me."
200658,L291316,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
200659,L291315,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,Oh dear.
200660,L291314,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,Jesus H. Christ!
200661,L291123,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"It was on my Dad's list of ""things to do."" But the House did him first."
200662,L291122,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
200663,L291012,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?"
200664,L291011,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,"Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?"
200665,L291010,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
200666,L291008,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,I'm moved beyond words.
200667,L291007,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it ""inspirational."" From some German cathedral a million years ago: ""Driving the Demons From the Mind."""
200668,L291006,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,Not at all!
200669,L291005,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
200670,L290979,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So..."

200672,L291464,u5925,m391,SARA,C'mon.
200673,L291463,u5917,m391,BLACKBURN,Don't think it'll be a problem.

200761,L291125,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.

200859,L291236,u5925,m391,SARA,Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
200860,L291184,u5925,m391,SARA,Don't push it.
200861,L291183,u5918,m391,EDDIE,I'm better than that.
200862,L291182,u5925,m391,SARA,And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
200863,L291027,u5918,m391,EDDIE,I thought she was dead. For sure.
200864,L291026,u5925,m391,SARA,Is she...alright?
200865,L291090,u5922,m391,MELISSA,"How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?"
200866,L291089,u5918,m391,EDDIE,Then what the hell are we doing here?
200867,L291085,u5918,m391,EDDIE,"Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service."
200868,L291084,u5922,m391,MELISSA,"Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity."
200869,L291042,u5922,m391,MELISSA,I hope not.
200870,L291041,u5918,m391,EDDIE,"So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?"
200871,L291020,u5918,m391,EDDIE,"Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something."
200872,L291019,u5922,m391,MELISSA,"...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit."
200873,L291016,u5922,m391,MELISSA,The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
200874,L291015,u5918,m391,EDDIE,You've got your own TV show?
200875,L291014,u5922,m391,MELISSA,"I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack ""Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos"" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em."
200876,L291001,u5922,m391,MELISSA,So where's the party?
200877,L291000,u5918,m391,EDDIE,...Jesus H. Christ.

200880,L291591,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted."
200881,L291590,u5923,m391,PRICE,No...
200882,L291588,u5923,m391,PRICE,"-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --"
200883,L291587,u5919,m391,EVELYN,-- wit...nesses --
200884,L291586,u5923,m391,PRICE,"-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --"
200885,L291585,u5919,m391,EVELYN,-- what...are...you...going...to --
200886,L291584,u5923,m391,PRICE,"-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --"
200887,L291583,u5919,m391,EVELYN,Steven --
200888,L291339,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have."
200889,L291338,u5923,m391,PRICE,They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
200890,L291337,u5919,m391,EVELYN,Question answered.
200891,L291336,u5923,m391,PRICE,Jesus!
200892,L291334,u5919,m391,EVELYN,-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
200893,L291333,u5923,m391,PRICE,"-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --"
200894,L291332,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --"
200895,L291331,u5923,m391,PRICE,"If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --"
200896,L291330,u5919,m391,EVELYN,-- and who's next on your list?
200897,L291329,u5923,m391,PRICE,-- I pose you the same question --
200898,L291328,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --"
200899,L291327,u5923,m391,PRICE,Asking the wrong person again.
200900,L291326,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?"
200901,L291289,u5919,m391,EVELYN,Stalking the wild poltergeist.
200902,L291288,u5923,m391,PRICE,Where is she?
200903,L291287,u5919,m391,EVELYN,Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
200904,L291177,u5923,m391,PRICE,"A simple leak, if it's okay with you."
200905,L291176,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?"
200906,L291171,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart."
200907,L291170,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?"
200908,L291163,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find."
200909,L291162,u5923,m391,PRICE,What are you talking about?
200910,L291152,u5923,m391,PRICE,-- in the act.
200911,L291151,u5919,m391,EVELYN,-- the sadistic prick --
200912,L291150,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --"
200913,L291149,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"Really? Well, let it rip."
200914,L291148,u5923,m391,PRICE,Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
200915,L291147,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once."
200916,L291146,u5923,m391,PRICE,-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
200917,L291066,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab."
200918,L291065,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July."
200919,L291064,u5923,m391,PRICE,I know.
200920,L291063,u5919,m391,EVELYN,You're hurting me.
200921,L291062,u5923,m391,PRICE,-- just not always in the sexual sense.
200922,L291061,u5923,m391,PRICE,You know everything you do gets me hot.
200923,L291060,u5919,m391,EVELYN,Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
200924,L291059,u5923,m391,PRICE,"You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!"
200925,L291058,u5919,m391,EVELYN,All accidents until proven otherwise.
200926,L291057,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The ""O.J."" knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your ""Jim Jones Kool- Aid"" that was exactly that?"
200927,L291056,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds."
200928,L291055,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?"
200929,L291054,u5919,m391,EVELYN,What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
200930,L291053,u5923,m391,PRICE,"You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo."
200931,L291052,u5919,m391,EVELYN,Then who are they?
200932,L291051,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited."
200933,L291050,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win."
200934,L291049,u5923,m391,PRICE,Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
200935,L291048,u5919,m391,EVELYN,I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
200936,L291039,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Oh, I think we're going to have several."
200937,L291038,u5919,m391,EVELYN,Could we have a word?
200938,L291036,u5919,m391,EVELYN,Haven't they already?
200939,L291035,u5923,m391,PRICE,"You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!"
200940,L291034,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"I'm not laughing, Steven."
200941,L291033,u5923,m391,PRICE,I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
200942,L291032,u5919,m391,EVELYN,Don't touch me!
200943,L290945,u5919,m391,EVELYN,"Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: ""Haunted Hill"" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --"
200944,L290944,u5923,m391,PRICE,"-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown."
200945,L290971,u5920,m391,JENZEN,Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
200946,L290970,u5925,m391,SARA,"...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?"

200948,L290967,u5925,m391,SARA,What?
200949,L290966,u5920,m391,JENZEN,"-- well, here's a better one: you're fired."
200950,L290965,u5925,m391,SARA,"No, no, it's just --"
200951,L290964,u5920,m391,JENZEN,You think this is fucking funny??
200952,L290957,u5920,m391,JENZEN,"-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new."
200953,L290956,u5925,m391,SARA,I was in the middle of --
200954,L290955,u5920,m391,JENZEN,You didn't think to ask?
200955,L290954,u5925,m391,SARA,Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
200956,L290953,u5920,m391,JENZEN,"Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?"
200957,L290952,u5925,m391,SARA,"I don't know, Ms. Jenzen."
200958,L290932,u5923,m391,PRICE,Maybe if I --
200959,L290931,u5921,m391,KIRSTEN,Please! Something! Oh-God!
200960,L290929,u5923,m391,PRICE,Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!

200963,L290920,u5921,m391,KIRSTEN,First time for everything.
200964,L290916,u5923,m391,PRICE,I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
200965,L290915,u5921,m391,KIRSTEN,Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
200966,L290913,u5923,m391,PRICE,I think it's something better experienced then described.
200967,L290912,u5921,m391,KIRSTEN,And then what happens?
200968,L290911,u5923,m391,PRICE,Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
200969,L290909,u5923,m391,PRICE,Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
200970,L290908,u5921,m391,KIRSTEN,"Your roller coaster that is, quote: ""unlike any that has ever come before it."""

200977,L291432,u5923,m391,PRICE,Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
200978,L291431,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
200979,L291410,u5923,m391,PRICE,"I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as ""ghosts."" This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --"

200981,L291356,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!"

200983,L291354,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,I think...I may have the answer.
200984,L291136,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out."
200985,L291135,u5923,m391,PRICE,Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
200986,L291101,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
200987,L291100,u5923,m391,PRICE,-- even if I give you a million as well?

200991,L291096,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --"
200992,L291080,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing."
200993,L291079,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,I'm ready now.
200994,L291031,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,I can't remember at the moment.
200995,L291030,u5923,m391,PRICE,"She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?"
200996,L291562,u5925,m391,SARA,"Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price."
200997,L291561,u5923,m391,PRICE,Please! I need your help.
200998,L291560,u5925,m391,SARA,Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.

201005,L291444,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Well, I can't, sweetheart."
201006,L291443,u5925,m391,SARA,I'll take my chances.
201007,L291442,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the ""Saturation Chamber."""
201008,L291441,u5925,m391,SARA,"Well, I don't."
201009,L291436,u5923,m391,PRICE,I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
201010,L291435,u5925,m391,SARA,Fascinated.
201011,L291434,u5923,m391,PRICE,Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
201012,L291433,u5925,m391,SARA,"If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now."

201014,L291424,u5923,m391,PRICE,I was upstairs!
201015,L291422,u5923,m391,PRICE,-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
201016,L291421,u5925,m391,SARA,-- the window and door grates --
201017,L291406,u5923,m391,PRICE,I think I'll do what I damn well please.
201018,L291405,u5925,m391,SARA,I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.

201021,L291211,u5923,m391,PRICE,I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
201022,L291210,u5925,m391,SARA,Good way to get your head blown off.
201023,L291209,u5923,m391,PRICE,Sorry.
201024,L291095,u5923,m391,PRICE,"-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --"
201025,L291094,u5925,m391,SARA,This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
201026,L291088,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you."

201029,L291073,u5925,m391,SARA,What're you talking about?
201030,L291072,u5923,m391,PRICE,You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
201031,L291071,u5925,m391,SARA,Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
201032,L291198,u5923,m391,PRICE,Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
201033,L291197,u5926,m391,SCHECTER,Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
201034,L291196,u5923,m391,PRICE,No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
201035,L291195,u5926,m391,SCHECTER,Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
201036,L291194,u5923,m391,PRICE,It works.
201037,L291193,u5926,m391,SCHECTER,No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
201038,L291192,u5923,m391,PRICE,Then who did??
201039,L291191,u5926,m391,SCHECTER,I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
201040,L291190,u5923,m391,PRICE,Rewind that.
201041,L291189,u5926,m391,SCHECTER,-- it wasn't me.
201042,L291188,u5923,m391,PRICE,"I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just..."
201043,L291187,u5926,m391,SCHECTER,The lockdown thing.
201044,L291186,u5923,m391,PRICE,-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
201045,L290941,u5923,m391,PRICE,So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
201046,L290940,u5926,m391,SCHECTER,"""Dummy 6"" keeps losing his arm."
201047,L290939,u5923,m391,PRICE,Problem where? Looked good to me.
201048,L290938,u5923,m391,PRICE,"Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec."
201049,L290937,u5926,m391,SCHECTER,"Houston, I think we may have a problem."
201050,L291643,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,-- ten.
201051,L291642,u5925,m391,SARA,-- hey! --
201052,L291606,u5925,m391,SARA,"How, he's supposed to be dead!"
201053,L291605,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,He must've unsealed the room!
201054,L291604,u5925,m391,SARA,Pritchett: what is going on?
201055,L291544,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"Oh, dear."
201056,L291543,u5925,m391,SARA,Price!
201057,L291533,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,He would have been back by now.
201058,L291532,u5925,m391,SARA,Excuse me?
201059,L291531,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,Blackburn's dead.
201060,L291530,u5925,m391,SARA,"You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?"
201061,L291284,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
201062,L291283,u5925,m391,SARA,"Pritchett, what is this ""core of darkness""?"
201063,L291282,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie..."
201064,L291281,u5925,m391,SARA,There is something very not normal going on here!
201065,L291220,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
201066,L291219,u5925,m391,SARA,And you think it's in there?
201067,L291218,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
201068,L291217,u5925,m391,SARA,Ghosts killed your father?
201069,L291207,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931."
201070,L291206,u5925,m391,SARA,"You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives."
201071,L291159,u5925,m391,SARA,"Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight."
201072,L291158,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"You'll never find it, it's a maze down there."
201073,L291157,u5925,m391,SARA,"No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it."
201074,L291156,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there."
201075,L291155,u5925,m391,SARA,"Pritchett, this ""lockdown"" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?"
201076,L291154,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"Believe me, we need to."
201077,L291153,u5925,m391,SARA,"Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to."
201078,L291134,u5925,m391,SARA,Why not?
201079,L291133,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,Won't do any good.
201080,L291130,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
201081,L291129,u5925,m391,SARA,"Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?"
201082,L291128,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,Don't know that it does.
201083,L291103,u5925,m391,SARA,What's going on?
201084,L291102,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"Oh, no."
201085,L291044,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,I can't comment until I get paid.
201086,L291043,u5925,m391,SARA,"Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?"
201087,L290992,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,He must've beaten us all here!
201088,L290991,u5925,m391,SARA,-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
201089,L290990,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"Wish I could take the credit, but --"
201090,L290985,u5924,m391,PRITCHETT,"It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!"
201091,L290984,u5925,m391,SARA,"But the million bucks each, that's for real?"
201092,L291555,u5927,m391,VOICE,-- something horrible...I don't understand --
201093,L291554,u5925,m391,SARA,-- I'm coming --
201094,L291553,u5927,m391,VOICE,Something....happened --
201095,L291552,u5925,m391,SARA,"Keep talking, I'll find you!"
201096,L291551,u5927,m391,VOICE,Sara...?
201097,L291550,u5925,m391,SARA,"Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?"
201098,L291549,u5927,m391,VOICE,For the love of God....please...?
201099,L291548,u5925,m391,SARA,Melissa...?
201100,L291547,u5927,m391,VOICE,Please.....anyone....help me?
201101,L291273,u5927,m391,VOICE,Over here.
201102,L291272,u5925,m391,SARA,-- Eddie!!
201103,L291999,u5928,m392,AMY,The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
201104,L291998,u5932,m392,SHEA,We don't have proof of that.
201105,L291997,u5928,m392,AMY,It might have been her mother.
201106,L291996,u5932,m392,SHEA,So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
201107,L291955,u5928,m392,AMY,Colleen.
201108,L291954,u5932,m392,SHEA,What was her name?
201109,L291953,u5928,m392,AMY,It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
201110,L291951,u5928,m392,AMY,"I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide."
201111,L291950,u5932,m392,SHEA,Did you find something?
201112,L291949,u5928,m392,AMY,These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
201113,L291948,u5932,m392,SHEA,What's the matter?
201114,L291947,u5928,m392,AMY,Damn it.
201115,L291914,u5928,m392,AMY,You say you saw some activity here?
201116,L291913,u5932,m392,SHEA,"I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there..."
201117,L292147,u5933,m392,WILL,Good-bye.
201118,L292146,u5928,m392,AMY,Good-bye.
201119,L292139,u5928,m392,AMY,There's no need to be.
201120,L292138,u5933,m392,WILL,I'm sorry.
201121,L292137,u5928,m392,AMY,It will heal.
201122,L292136,u5933,m392,WILL,How's your arm?
201123,L292135,u5928,m392,AMY,"A few years older, perhaps."
201124,L292134,u5933,m392,WILL,Are you all right?
201125,L292048,u5933,m392,WILL,No!
201126,L292047,u5928,m392,AMY,Did you find her?!
201127,L292033,u5933,m392,WILL,Why don't you pass me your plate?
201128,L292032,u5928,m392,AMY,It looks delicious...
201129,L292022,u5928,m392,AMY,Yes.  It was.
201130,L292021,u5933,m392,WILL,"Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us."
201131,L292020,u5928,m392,AMY,So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
201132,L292019,u5933,m392,WILL,I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
201133,L292018,u5928,m392,AMY,"There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts."
201134,L292017,u5933,m392,WILL,How did you meet Dr. Shea?
201135,L292016,u5928,m392,AMY,"No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive."
201136,L292015,u5933,m392,WILL,"Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?"
201137,L292014,u5928,m392,AMY,I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
201138,L291934,u5928,m392,AMY,"I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here."
201139,L291933,u5933,m392,WILL,What will they tell you?
201140,L291932,u5928,m392,AMY,Town records are coming up now.
201141,L291909,u5933,m392,WILL,Suppose not.
201142,L291908,u5928,m392,AMY,They don't build them like this anymore.
201143,L292081,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death..."
201144,L292080,u5928,m392,AMY,What do these ingredients mean?
201145,L292079,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
201146,L292078,u5928,m392,AMY,I don't understand.
201147,L292077,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,By freeing them.
201148,L292076,u5928,m392,AMY,By killing them?
201149,L292075,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -"
201150,L292074,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
201151,L292073,u5928,m392,AMY,Where does this amulet come from?
201152,L291995,u5928,m392,AMY,That poor little girl.
201153,L291994,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
201154,L292240,u5929,m392,AUBREY,I'm ok mommy.
201155,L292239,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -"
201156,L292197,u5929,m392,AUBREY,What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
201157,L292196,u5930,m392,MAURA,Your father doesn't love us anymore!
201158,L292180,u5930,m392,MAURA,Go to your room!  Now!
201159,L292179,u5929,m392,AUBREY,H-how long will it take?
201160,L292175,u5930,m392,MAURA,We'll get it later.
201161,L292174,u5929,m392,AUBREY,What about all my other stuff?
201162,L292173,u5930,m392,MAURA,We're going to go someplace new.
201163,L292172,u5929,m392,AUBREY,"Where are we going to go, mommy?"
201164,L292143,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Yes, we'll be leaving soon."
201165,L292142,u5929,m392,AUBREY,Are we leaving mommy?
201166,L292120,u5929,m392,AUBREY,I'm scared!
201167,L292119,u5930,m392,MAURA,My angel!
201168,L292027,u5929,m392,AUBREY,Ok...
201169,L292026,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!"
201170,L291973,u5930,m392,MAURA,She's down...how do you mean honey?
201171,L291972,u5929,m392,AUBREY,She's down...
201172,L291960,u5929,m392,AUBREY,She talks to me.
201173,L291959,u5930,m392,MAURA,Can you talk to her?
201174,L291958,u5929,m392,AUBREY,Yes.
201175,L291957,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?"
201176,L291880,u5930,m392,MAURA,No it won't - no it won't!
201177,L291879,u5929,m392,AUBREY,It's going to hurt us!
201178,L291850,u5930,m392,MAURA,Who...is Colleen?
201179,L291849,u5929,m392,AUBREY,Maybe it was Colleen...
201180,L291848,u5930,m392,MAURA,Well then who did?!
201181,L291847,u5929,m392,AUBREY,"I didn't do anything, mommy."
201182,L291846,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Don't play games with me, little girl."
201183,L291828,u5930,m392,MAURA,We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
201184,L291827,u5929,m392,AUBREY,Can I do it again tonight?
201185,L291826,u5930,m392,MAURA,Well I bet you they're happy.
201186,L291825,u5929,m392,AUBREY,"Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night."
201187,L291777,u5930,m392,MAURA,Sure.
201188,L291776,u5929,m392,AUBREY,"Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?"

201192,L291975,u5929,m392,AUBREY,She's down.  Help her...
201193,L291970,u5929,m392,AUBREY,She's hiding.
201194,L291969,u5932,m392,SHEA,Where is she now?

201214,L291815,u5929,m392,AUBREY,Look daddy!  It's empty!
201215,L291774,u5929,m392,AUBREY,Did you ever see a leprechaun?
201216,L291773,u5933,m392,WILL,"That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life."
201217,L291772,u5929,m392,AUBREY,Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
201218,L291759,u5933,m392,WILL,For good luck honey.
201219,L291758,u5929,m392,AUBREY,Why?
201220,L291757,u5933,m392,WILL,He's blessing the house.
201221,L291756,u5929,m392,AUBREY,What's he doing daddy?
201222,L291704,u5933,m392,WILL,"Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it."
201223,L291703,u5929,m392,AUBREY,"I want this one, daddy."
201224,L291702,u5933,m392,WILL,Sure.  Did you see the others?
201225,L291701,u5929,m392,AUBREY,Can I have this room daddy?
201226,L292245,u5933,m392,WILL,I'm all right...
201227,L292244,u5930,m392,MAURA,You're bleeding.
201228,L292242,u5930,m392,MAURA,I'm ok.
201229,L292241,u5933,m392,WILL,Are you all right?
201230,L292237,u5930,m392,MAURA,What's happening!
201231,L292236,u5933,m392,WILL,Maura!
201232,L292233,u5933,m392,WILL,No...  NO!
201233,L292232,u5930,m392,MAURA,We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
201234,L292190,u5933,m392,WILL,Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
201235,L292189,u5930,m392,MAURA,We're not going.
201236,L292188,u5933,m392,WILL,"Maura, what is this!"
201237,L292187,u5933,m392,WILL,What are you talking about?
201238,L292186,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?"
201239,L292185,u5933,m392,WILL,What?
201240,L292184,u5930,m392,MAURA,Do you think I'm a fool?
201241,L292183,u5933,m392,WILL,Know what?
201242,L292182,u5930,m392,MAURA,You don't think I know?
201243,L292162,u5933,m392,WILL,No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
201244,L292161,u5930,m392,MAURA,Should I...
201245,L292160,u5933,m392,WILL,"You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?"
201246,L292159,u5933,m392,WILL,Ok...
201247,L292158,u5930,m392,MAURA,I'm fine.
201248,L292155,u5930,m392,MAURA,You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
201249,L292154,u5933,m392,WILL,It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
201250,L292046,u5930,m392,MAURA,Aubrey!
201251,L292045,u5933,m392,WILL,Aubrey!
201252,L292044,u5933,m392,WILL,Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
201253,L292043,u5930,m392,MAURA,She's gone!
201254,L292042,u5930,m392,MAURA,Oh my God where is she!
201255,L292025,u5930,m392,MAURA,Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
201256,L292024,u5933,m392,WILL,I think everything's ready.
201257,L292023,u5930,m392,MAURA,How are we doing?
201258,L291964,u5930,m392,MAURA,"You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her."
201259,L291963,u5933,m392,WILL,A friend?
201260,L291962,u5930,m392,MAURA,She has a...friend.  Colleen.
201261,L291961,u5933,m392,WILL,What are you talking about?
201262,L291923,u5930,m392,MAURA,Are you ok?
201263,L291922,u5933,m392,WILL,Whoa there...
201264,L291890,u5930,m392,MAURA,I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
201265,L291889,u5933,m392,WILL,It just disappeared.  Literally.
201266,L291875,u5933,m392,WILL,"I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something."
201267,L291874,u5930,m392,MAURA,Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
201268,L291873,u5933,m392,WILL,Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
201269,L291872,u5930,m392,MAURA,What about keeping an open mind?
201270,L291871,u5933,m392,WILL,Oh come on!
201271,L291870,u5930,m392,MAURA,I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
201272,L291869,u5933,m392,WILL,Who?
201273,L291868,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it."
201274,L291867,u5933,m392,WILL,"There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting."
201275,L291866,u5930,m392,MAURA,Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
201276,L291865,u5933,m392,WILL,"Well, I try to keep an open mind, but..."
201277,L291864,u5930,m392,MAURA,Well what do you think it is?
201278,L291863,u5933,m392,WILL,"Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened."
201279,L291862,u5930,m392,MAURA,But do you agree with me?
201280,L291861,u5930,m392,MAURA,I don't know what I'm saying.
201281,L291860,u5933,m392,WILL,So what are you saying?
201282,L291859,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape..."
201283,L291844,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -"
201284,L291843,u5933,m392,WILL,It was in the cellar.  Weird.
201285,L291842,u5930,m392,MAURA,What is it?
201286,L291840,u5930,m392,MAURA,Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
201287,L291839,u5933,m392,WILL,No.
201288,L291838,u5930,m392,MAURA,Were you fooling with the power?
201289,L291837,u5933,m392,WILL,The heater's here.
201290,L291807,u5930,m392,MAURA,Ok.
201291,L291806,u5933,m392,WILL,...set up some more things.
201292,L291805,u5933,m392,WILL,"Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to..."
201293,L291804,u5930,m392,MAURA,"She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things."
201294,L291803,u5933,m392,WILL,No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
201295,L291798,u5933,m392,WILL,I don't know.  That's strange.
201296,L291797,u5930,m392,MAURA,What the hell is that?
201297,L291794,u5930,m392,MAURA,It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
201298,L291793,u5933,m392,WILL,What?
201299,L291792,u5930,m392,MAURA,Are you playing tricks on me?
201300,L291738,u5930,m392,MAURA,I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
201301,L291737,u5933,m392,WILL,God rest her soul.
201302,L291736,u5933,m392,WILL,Or what she was worth.
201303,L291735,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place."
201304,L291734,u5933,m392,WILL,Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
201305,L291733,u5930,m392,MAURA,I wish I knew more about her.
201306,L291732,u5933,m392,WILL,To our family.
201307,L291731,u5930,m392,MAURA,To our family.
201308,L291726,u5933,m392,WILL,Whatever you say.
201309,L291725,u5930,m392,MAURA,It's just going to take a while.
201310,L291724,u5933,m392,WILL,"Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that."
201311,L291723,u5930,m392,MAURA,You didn't think much about that before.
201312,L291722,u5933,m392,WILL,"Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment."
201313,L291721,u5930,m392,MAURA,Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
201314,L291720,u5933,m392,WILL,What will Aubrey think?
201315,L291719,u5930,m392,MAURA,"I just, I don't know..."
201316,L291718,u5933,m392,WILL,Oh come on...
201317,L291717,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while."
201318,L291716,u5933,m392,WILL,What's the matter?
201319,L291712,u5930,m392,MAURA,Must be...
201320,L291711,u5933,m392,WILL,Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
201321,L291710,u5930,m392,MAURA,Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
201322,L291709,u5933,m392,WILL,The place is pretty dusty.
201323,L291708,u5930,m392,MAURA,I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
201324,L291707,u5933,m392,WILL,Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
201325,L291706,u5930,m392,MAURA,Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
201326,L291692,u5933,m392,WILL,Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
201327,L291691,u5930,m392,MAURA,I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
201328,L292037,u5932,m392,SHEA,White meat will be fine...
201329,L292036,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?"
201330,L292031,u5930,m392,MAURA,You'll have to settle for turkey.
201331,L292030,u5932,m392,SHEA,I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
201332,L292007,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Yeah, they told us this was the best."
201333,L292006,u5932,m392,SHEA,Maura.
201334,L292005,u5930,m392,MAURA,Maura.
201335,L292004,u5932,m392,SHEA,"You've done your homework, Mrs. South."
201336,L291944,u5930,m392,MAURA,Before.
201337,L291943,u5932,m392,SHEA,"I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?"
201338,L291931,u5932,m392,SHEA,"If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled."
201339,L291930,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?"
201340,L291911,u5930,m392,MAURA,She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
201341,L291910,u5932,m392,SHEA,Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
201342,L291906,u5930,m392,MAURA,What about the other five percent?
201343,L291905,u5932,m392,SHEA,We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
201344,L291904,u5930,m392,MAURA,"What do you mean, unfortunately?"
201345,L291903,u5932,m392,SHEA,We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
201346,L291902,u5930,m392,MAURA,I think we should do it.
201347,L291894,u5932,m392,SHEA,I could see if I detect the presence of something.
201348,L291893,u5930,m392,MAURA,We don't know.
201349,L291892,u5930,m392,MAURA,Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
201350,L291891,u5932,m392,SHEA,"Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be."
201351,L292111,u5930,m392,MAURA,Come back to us honey!
201352,L292110,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,She's coming back.  Keep talking!
201353,L292106,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!"
201354,L292105,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,Concentrate!  She can hear you!
201355,L292093,u5930,m392,MAURA,Aubrey?  It's mommy.
201356,L292092,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
201357,L292089,u5930,m392,MAURA,"So what should we do, father?"
201358,L292088,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her."
201359,L292085,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -"
201360,L292084,u5930,m392,MAURA,Why?
201361,L292083,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
201362,L292062,u5930,m392,MAURA,What!
201363,L292061,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,Your daughter's been taken.
201364,L291770,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
201365,L291769,u5930,m392,MAURA,Well it's nice that you were there for her.
201366,L291766,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by."
201367,L291765,u5930,m392,MAURA,It was a shame.
201368,L291764,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly."
201369,L291763,u5930,m392,MAURA,Did you know her very well?
201370,L291762,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
201371,L291754,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,May I come in?
201372,L291753,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Oh, that's nice..."
201373,L291752,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
201374,L291748,u5930,m392,MAURA,"Yes, I am."
201375,L291747,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,You must be a Londrigan.
201376,L292133,u5933,m392,WILL,We'll be there.
201377,L292132,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass."
201378,L292131,u5933,m392,WILL,"Yes, they are."
201379,L292130,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
201380,L292128,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us."
201381,L292127,u5933,m392,WILL,What's going to happen?
201382,L292126,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,I didn't do anything...God saved her...
201383,L292125,u5933,m392,WILL,I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
201384,L292124,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
201385,L292123,u5933,m392,WILL,The rain is letting up.
201386,L292101,u5933,m392,WILL,"It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you..."
201387,L292100,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,Keep talking!
201388,L292087,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,It will not take long...
201389,L292086,u5933,m392,WILL,How long will it take!
201390,L292067,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!"
201391,L292066,u5933,m392,WILL,What are you getting at!
201392,L292065,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"We must return it, if you want your daughter back."
201393,L292064,u5933,m392,WILL,So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
201394,L292063,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost."
201395,L292058,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,Did you remove anything in the cellar!
201396,L292057,u5933,m392,WILL,What...amulet?
201397,L292053,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,The amulet...
201398,L292052,u5933,m392,WILL,This isn't happening...
201399,L292001,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us."
201400,L292000,u5933,m392,WILL,We'll never know for sure.
201401,L291785,u5933,m392,WILL,Good night.
201402,L291784,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.
201403,L291782,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,Perhaps I'll see you in church.
201404,L291781,u5933,m392,WILL,Thank you.
201405,L291780,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home."
201406,L291779,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go."
201407,L291778,u5933,m392,WILL,"Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty."
201408,L291768,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,"Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things..."
201409,L291767,u5933,m392,WILL,What was she afraid of?
201410,L291745,u5933,m392,WILL,How can I help you?
201411,L291744,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
201412,L291743,u5933,m392,WILL,And you...are?
201413,L291742,u5931,m392,SEAMUS,You must be the new tenants.
201414,L291990,u5932,m392,SHEA,"I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!"
201415,L291989,u5933,m392,WILL,Well what is it!
201416,L291988,u5932,m392,SHEA,There's something through that wall!
201417,L291987,u5933,m392,WILL,What?
201418,L291986,u5932,m392,SHEA,There's something in there.
201419,L291946,u5933,m392,WILL,"Not at all, if it can help."
201420,L291945,u5932,m392,SHEA,Do you mind if I borrow it?
201421,L291942,u5933,m392,WILL,Runic?
201422,L291941,u5932,m392,SHEA,I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
201423,L291940,u5933,m392,WILL,It was nailed to the cellar wall.
201424,L291939,u5932,m392,SHEA,Where did you find this?
201425,L291937,u5933,m392,WILL,"Not really.  Oh, wait a minute."
201426,L291936,u5932,m392,SHEA,"Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?"
201427,L291929,u5932,m392,SHEA,Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
201428,L291928,u5933,m392,WILL,So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
201429,L291927,u5932,m392,SHEA,Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
201430,L291901,u5932,m392,SHEA,"Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that."
201431,L291900,u5933,m392,WILL,And what would you do?
201432,L291899,u5932,m392,SHEA,Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
201433,L291897,u5933,m392,WILL,Oh.
201434,L291896,u5932,m392,SHEA,No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
201435,L292308,u5937,m393,JOEY,No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
201436,L292307,u5934,m393,BRAD,Not on station time.
201437,L292303,u5934,m393,BRAD,"And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story."
201438,L292302,u5937,m393,JOEY,I know what I saw.
201439,L292301,u5934,m393,BRAD,Right.  Like last night's doozie.
201440,L292300,u5937,m393,JOEY,"Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories."
201441,L292299,u5934,m393,BRAD,"C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here."
201442,L292296,u5937,m393,JOEY,Jesus Christ ...
201443,L292295,u5934,m393,BRAD,"What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman."
201444,L292293,u5934,m393,BRAD,"I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made."
201445,L292292,u5937,m393,JOEY,What do you mean?
201446,L292643,u5937,m393,JOEY,Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
201447,L292642,u5935,m393,DOC,You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
201448,L292641,u5937,m393,JOEY,Hello?
201449,L292270,u5937,m393,JOEY,That is the story of my life.
201450,L292269,u5935,m393,DOC,OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
201451,L292268,u5937,m393,JOEY,You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
201452,L292267,u5935,m393,DOC,"Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place."
201453,L292266,u5937,m393,JOEY,"Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter."
201454,L292261,u5935,m393,DOC,"Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?"
201455,L292260,u5937,m393,JOEY,"I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me."
201456,L292639,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box."
201457,L292638,u5937,m393,JOEY,Wha .... ?
201458,L292637,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,Your apartment.
201459,L292636,u5937,m393,JOEY,So where is it?
201460,L292635,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it."
201461,L292634,u5937,m393,JOEY,Then tell me what to do.
201462,L292633,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think."
201463,L292632,u5937,m393,JOEY,I don't know ...
201464,L292631,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage."
201465,L292630,u5937,m393,JOEY,What can we do?
201466,L292629,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering."
201467,L292628,u5937,m393,JOEY,What will he do?  What does he want?
201468,L292627,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable."
201469,L292626,u5937,m393,JOEY,"Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?"
201470,L292624,u5937,m393,JOEY,And why are you back?  Why are we here?
201471,L292623,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,Something bad.
201472,L292622,u5937,m393,JOEY,And what did you discover?
201473,L292621,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery."
201474,L292620,u5937,m393,JOEY,And what is ... this frozen moment?
201475,L292619,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant."
201476,L292617,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?"
201477,L292616,u5937,m393,JOEY,Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
201478,L292615,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?"
201479,L292613,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
201480,L292612,u5937,m393,JOEY,"It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?"
201481,L292611,u5936,m393,ELLIOTT,"You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?"
201482,L292610,u5937,m393,JOEY,Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
201483,L292448,u5937,m393,JOEY,"Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale."
201484,L292447,u5942,m393,TERRI,Joey ... ?
201485,L292444,u5937,m393,JOEY,God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
201486,L292443,u5942,m393,TERRI,What am I looking for?
201487,L292420,u5942,m393,TERRI,Here!  Here!  Pull over!
201488,L292419,u5937,m393,JOEY,"Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ..."
201489,L292418,u5942,m393,TERRI,"For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore."
201490,L292417,u5937,m393,JOEY,"Oh, Terri ..."
201491,L292416,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Buying some drugs, alright?"
201492,L292415,u5937,m393,JOEY,Terri?
201493,L292414,u5937,m393,JOEY,What on earth were you doing down here?
201494,L292413,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?"
201495,L292412,u5937,m393,JOEY,Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
201496,L292411,u5937,m393,JOEY,It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
201497,L292410,u5942,m393,TERRI,Sure.  Why?
201498,L292409,u5937,m393,JOEY,Would you know this store again?
201499,L292408,u5942,m393,TERRI,"I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club."
201500,L292407,u5937,m393,JOEY,That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
201501,L292406,u5942,m393,TERRI,No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
201502,L292405,u5937,m393,JOEY,Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
201503,L292404,u5942,m393,TERRI,Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
201504,L292403,u5937,m393,JOEY,Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
201505,L292402,u5942,m393,TERRI,But I don't know what's going on.
201506,L292398,u5937,m393,JOEY,No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
201507,L292397,u5942,m393,TERRI,Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
201508,L292396,u5937,m393,JOEY,Every day.
201509,L292395,u5942,m393,TERRI,And he still sits there?
201510,L292394,u5937,m393,JOEY,"I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings."
201511,L292393,u5942,m393,TERRI,Who's that?
201512,L292392,u5937,m393,JOEY,"... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ..."
201513,L292389,u5937,m393,JOEY,I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
201514,L292388,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?"
201515,L292387,u5937,m393,JOEY,No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
201516,L292386,u5942,m393,TERRI,Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
201517,L292385,u5942,m393,TERRI,Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
201518,L292384,u5937,m393,JOEY,How have you ... ?
201519,L292383,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old."
201520,L292382,u5937,m393,JOEY,The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
201521,L292381,u5942,m393,TERRI,This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
201522,L292380,u5937,m393,JOEY,"No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?"
201523,L292379,u5942,m393,TERRI,I'll do it!
201524,L292378,u5937,m393,JOEY,I'll boil some water.
201525,L292377,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me."
201526,L292376,u5937,m393,JOEY,"Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?"
201527,L292375,u5942,m393,TERRI,I figured I'd make breakfast.
201528,L292364,u5942,m393,TERRI,That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
201529,L292363,u5937,m393,JOEY,Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
201530,L292362,u5942,m393,TERRI,Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
201531,L292361,u5937,m393,JOEY,Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
201532,L292360,u5942,m393,TERRI,"The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22"
201533,L292359,u5937,m393,JOEY,Taken what?
201534,L292358,u5942,m393,TERRI,"No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue."
201535,L292357,u5937,m393,JOEY,Did you know him?
201536,L292356,u5942,m393,TERRI,But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
201537,L292355,u5937,m393,JOEY,"Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was."
201538,L292354,u5942,m393,TERRI,Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
201539,L292352,u5942,m393,TERRI,It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
201540,L292351,u5937,m393,JOEY,Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
201541,L292350,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?"
201542,L292349,u5937,m393,JOEY,I'm trying to quit.
201543,L292348,u5942,m393,TERRI,Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
201544,L292344,u5937,m393,JOEY,"I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them."
201545,L292343,u5942,m393,TERRI,"No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?"
201546,L292342,u5937,m393,JOEY,What?
201547,L292341,u5942,m393,TERRI,That's great.
201548,L292340,u5937,m393,JOEY,"God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out."
201549,L292339,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?"
201550,L292338,u5937,m393,JOEY,"No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father."
201551,L292337,u5942,m393,TERRI,Sorry.
201552,L292336,u5937,m393,JOEY,Why are you so interested?
201553,L292335,u5942,m393,TERRI,What is it?
201554,L292334,u5937,m393,JOEY,"... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is."
201555,L292333,u5937,m393,JOEY,Oh yeah ...
201556,L292332,u5942,m393,TERRI,Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
201557,L292331,u5937,m393,JOEY,What?
201558,L292329,u5942,m393,TERRI,Right.
201559,L292328,u5937,m393,JOEY,I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
201560,L292324,u5937,m393,JOEY,No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
201561,L292323,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ..."
201562,L292322,u5937,m393,JOEY,Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
201563,L292321,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?"
201564,L292320,u5937,m393,JOEY,"I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night."
201565,L292319,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?"
201566,L292318,u5937,m393,JOEY,Right.  Right!
201567,L292317,u5942,m393,TERRI,You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
201568,L292316,u5937,m393,JOEY,"Joey.  Yeah, who is this?"
201569,L292315,u5942,m393,TERRI,Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
201570,L292314,u5937,m393,JOEY,Uh-huh?
201571,L292289,u5937,m393,JOEY,Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
201572,L292288,u5942,m393,TERRI,Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
201573,L292287,u5937,m393,JOEY,Where?
201574,L292286,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!"
201575,L292285,u5942,m393,TERRI,It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
201576,L292284,u5937,m393,JOEY,"Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you."
201577,L292279,u5937,m393,JOEY,What happened to him?
201578,L292278,u5942,m393,TERRI,It was off the statue.  In the club.
201579,L292441,u5939,m393,MAMA,Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
201580,L292440,u5937,m393,JOEY,I don't know.  Maybe.
201581,L292439,u5939,m393,MAMA,You gonna buy?
201582,L292438,u5937,m393,JOEY,Can we see?
201583,L292437,u5939,m393,MAMA,"Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want."
201584,L292436,u5937,m393,JOEY,What else came with it?  Anything still here?
201585,L292435,u5939,m393,MAMA,It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
201586,L292434,u5937,m393,JOEY,Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
201587,L292433,u5939,m393,MAMA,Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
201588,L292428,u5939,m393,MAMA,"I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ..."
201589,L292427,u5937,m393,JOEY,No.  We want ...
201590,L292426,u5939,m393,MAMA,Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
201591,L292425,u5937,m393,JOEY,"No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ..."
201592,L292424,u5939,m393,MAMA,No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
201593,L292493,u5938,m393,JP,Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
201594,L292492,u5941,m393,SANDY,"You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ..."
201595,L292491,u5938,m393,JP,"I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life."
201596,L292490,u5941,m393,SANDY,You shit.  Who do you think you are?
201597,L292489,u5938,m393,JP,And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
201598,L292488,u5941,m393,SANDY,But you gave me a rose ...
201599,L292487,u5941,m393,SANDY,Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
201600,L292486,u5938,m393,JP,It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
201601,L292484,u5938,m393,JP,Unh-unh.
201602,L292483,u5941,m393,SANDY,Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
201603,L292471,u5938,m393,JP,No.  Thank you.
201604,L292470,u5941,m393,SANDY,Wow.  Thank you.
201605,L292469,u5938,m393,JP,Yes really.
201606,L292468,u5941,m393,SANDY,No.  Really?
201607,L292467,u5938,m393,JP,... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
201608,L292466,u5938,m393,JP,"Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it..."
201609,L292465,u5941,m393,SANDY,Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
201610,L292464,u5938,m393,JP,Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
201611,L292463,u5941,m393,SANDY,I'm sorry.
201612,L292462,u5938,m393,JP,He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
201613,L292461,u5941,m393,SANDY,The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
201614,L292460,u5938,m393,JP,"You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ..."
201615,L292459,u5941,m393,SANDY,A prize?  For what?
201616,L292458,u5938,m393,JP,It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
201617,L292457,u5941,m393,SANDY,Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
201618,L292456,u5938,m393,JP,Thank you.
201619,L292455,u5941,m393,SANDY,And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
201620,L292454,u5938,m393,JP,Uh-huh.
201621,L292453,u5941,m393,SANDY,"You're JP Monroe, right?"
201622,L292452,u5938,m393,JP,Welcome. 38
201623,L292521,u5940,m393,PINHEAD,It has already begun.
201624,L292520,u5938,m393,JP,How do we start?
201625,L292519,u5940,m393,PINHEAD,God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
201626,L292518,u5938,m393,JP,But how in God's name ...
201627,L292517,u5940,m393,PINHEAD,"You see, we're not so dissimilar."
201628,L292516,u5938,m393,JP,"Hey, that's what makes the world go round."
201629,L292515,u5940,m393,PINHEAD,A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
201630,L292513,u5940,m393,PINHEAD,"Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you."
201631,L292512,u5938,m393,JP,What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
201632,L292511,u5940,m393,PINHEAD,"Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse..."
201633,L292509,u5938,m393,JP,Fuck you!
201634,L292508,u5940,m393,PINHEAD,"I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?"
201635,L292503,u5938,m393,JP,No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
201636,L292502,u5940,m393,PINHEAD,Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
201637,L292501,u5938,m393,JP,Yes.
201638,L292500,u5940,m393,PINHEAD,On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
201639,L292499,u5938,m393,JP,"That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway."
201640,L292498,u5940,m393,PINHEAD,What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
201641,L292497,u5938,m393,JP,What ... What ... ?
201642,L292583,u5938,m393,JP,"Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright."
201643,L292582,u5942,m393,TERRI,Really?
201644,L292581,u5938,m393,JP,"Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this."
201645,L292580,u5942,m393,TERRI,"No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again."
201646,L292579,u5938,m393,JP,"That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore."
201647,L292578,u5938,m393,JP,"Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night."
201648,L292577,u5942,m393,TERRI,I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
201649,L292576,u5938,m393,JP,"Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know."
201650,L292575,u5942,m393,TERRI,Yeah right.  Look ...
201651,L292574,u5938,m393,JP,"Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?"
201652,L292573,u5942,m393,TERRI,A girl?  Anyone I should know?
201653,L292572,u5938,m393,JP,"Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it."
201654,L292571,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Yeah ... yeah, it looks different."
201655,L292570,u5938,m393,JP,"No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am."
201656,L292569,u5942,m393,TERRI,Not quite.  This wasn't here.
201657,L292547,u5938,m393,JP,C'mon.  It'll be great.
201658,L292546,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Oh, I don't ..."
201659,L292545,u5938,m393,JP,"Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?"
201660,L292544,u5942,m393,TERRI,Yes. 53
201661,L292543,u5938,m393,JP,"That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?"
201662,L292542,u5942,m393,TERRI,I miss you too.
201663,L292541,u5938,m393,JP,"I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you."
201664,L292540,u5942,m393,TERRI,"Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ..."
201665,L292539,u5938,m393,JP,"Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?"
201666,L292538,u5942,m393,TERRI,You're apologizing?
201667,L292537,u5938,m393,JP,"No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ..."
201668,L292536,u5942,m393,TERRI,Yeah really.  I'm ...
201669,L292535,u5938,m393,JP,Really?
201670,L292534,u5942,m393,TERRI,Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
201671,L292533,u5938,m393,JP,"Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?"
201672,L292532,u5942,m393,TERRI,Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
201673,L292530,u5942,m393,TERRI,What do you want?
201674,L292529,u5938,m393,JP,"Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?"
201675,L292528,u5942,m393,TERRI,JP?
201676,L292527,u5938,m393,JP,Not quite.
201677,L292526,u5942,m393,TERRI,Joey?
201678,L293229,u5946,m394,ANNA,Guards come exactly every three minutes....
201679,L293228,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Eighth room down, babe..."
201680,L293219,u5946,m394,ANNA,Gum.
201681,L293218,u5943,m394,ALEX,Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
201682,L293211,u5946,m394,ANNA,"It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails."
201683,L293210,u5943,m394,ALEX,The security's actually not that severe.
201684,L293197,u5943,m394,ALEX,"I laughed, I cried."
201685,L293196,u5946,m394,ANNA,That was beautiful.
201686,L293190,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just..."
201687,L293189,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?..."
201688,L293188,u5946,m394,ANNA,Something like that.
201689,L293187,u5943,m394,ALEX,You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
201690,L293175,u5943,m394,ALEX,"It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they..."
201691,L293174,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Oh thank God, you're dead..."
201692,L293303,u5943,m394,ALEX,Get em....
201693,L293302,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Let's just forget it, I mean..."
201694,L293301,u5943,m394,ALEX,Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
201695,L293281,u5951,m394,HAWK,"You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there..."
201696,L293280,u5943,m394,ALEX,I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
201697,L293279,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Alex, are you...."
201698,L293262,u5951,m394,HAWK,"I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first..."
201699,L293261,u5943,m394,ALEX,I'm a ghost.  Boo.
201700,L293254,u5943,m394,ALEX,"""But we'll be the same as we started..."
201701,L293253,u5951,m394,HAWK,"""We all had our quarrels and parted..."""
201702,L293249,u5951,m394,HAWK,You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
201703,L293248,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Anna, I think you better stay...."
201704,L293247,u5951,m394,HAWK,That was close....
201705,L293243,u5943,m394,ALEX,"""How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"""
201706,L293242,u5951,m394,HAWK,"""Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"""
201707,L293236,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Don't worry, we'll get it..."
201708,L293235,u5943,m394,ALEX,Now that's a lock.
201709,L293232,u5943,m394,ALEX,"""Maybe we're ragged and funny."""
201710,L293231,u5951,m394,HAWK,"""Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money."
201711,L293222,u5951,m394,HAWK,Okay.
201712,L293221,u5943,m394,ALEX,Why not just go now?
201713,L293220,u5951,m394,HAWK,Count of three?
201714,L293214,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard..."
201715,L293213,u5943,m394,ALEX,You sound disappointed.
201716,L293212,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was ""Who Shot J.R.?"""
201717,L293206,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm."
201718,L293205,u5943,m394,ALEX,We're going in from the ground floor.
201719,L293199,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?"
201720,L293198,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!"
201721,L293179,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I..."

201723,L293177,u5943,m394,ALEX,But I said I was sorry....
201724,L293176,u5951,m394,HAWK,You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
201725,L292888,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?"
201726,L292887,u5943,m394,ALEX,You re not thinking of going to...
201727,L292886,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up."
201728,L292885,u5943,m394,ALEX,Why try?
201729,L292884,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand..."
201730,L292883,u5951,m394,HAWK,"""Attempted.""  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I...."

201732,L292881,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS."
201733,L292880,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's ""Sforza,"" an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things."
201734,L292879,u5951,m394,HAWK,"The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo.."
201735,L292878,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?"
201736,L292877,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way."
201737,L292876,u5943,m394,ALEX,Did I miss anything?
201738,L292846,u5951,m394,HAWK,Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...

201740,L292844,u5951,m394,HAWK,What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.

201753,L292818,u5943,m394,ALEX,No need.  Guards' station's right there.
201754,L292817,u5951,m394,HAWK,Cameras?

201766,L292802,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it."
201767,L292801,u5951,m394,HAWK,"The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40."

201769,L292799,u5951,m394,HAWK,It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....

201774,L292768,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss."
201775,L292767,u5951,m394,HAWK,"I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?"
201776,L292766,u5943,m394,ALEX,"I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us ""Watering Hole of the Month.""  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper."

201782,L292759,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?"
201783,L292758,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?"
201784,L292757,u5951,m394,HAWK,Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
201785,L292756,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--"

201792,L292748,u5943,m394,ALEX,"Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated."
201793,L292747,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day."
201794,L292746,u5943,m394,ALEX,That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?

201809,L293109,u5952,m394,KAPLAN,"Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office...."

201811,L293035,u5952,m394,KAPLAN,"Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty."
201812,L293034,u5945,m394,ALMOND JOY,"Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?"
201813,L292932,u5952,m394,KAPLAN,I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...

201821,L293054,u5945,m394,ALMOND JOY,"Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement...."
201822,L293053,u5954,m394,SNICKERS,"Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections.

201828,L293146,u5946,m394,ANNA,I'm going to find out.
201829,L293145,u5947,m394,CARDINAL,"Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?"
201830,L293144,u5946,m394,ANNA,"You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower."
201831,L293142,u5947,m394,CARDINAL,Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
201832,L293141,u5946,m394,ANNA,A little petting is not the issue!

201835,L293138,u5947,m394,CARDINAL,"Anna, what are you trying to say..."
201836,L293137,u5946,m394,ANNA,I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
201837,L293136,u5947,m394,CARDINAL,Hit me with your best shot.
201838,L293021,u5946,m394,ANNA,Yeah.  The big E.
201839,L293020,u5947,m394,CARDINAL,"Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man."
201840,L293019,u5946,m394,ANNA,"That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said ""Polite conversation is rarely either."""
201841,L293018,u5947,m394,CARDINAL,"Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?"
201842,L293017,u5946,m394,ANNA,"No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week."
201843,L293016,u5947,m394,CARDINAL,Did he mention the Mayflowers?
201844,L293365,u5951,m394,HAWK,I got my planet back.
201845,L293364,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?"
201846,L293363,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something..."
201847,L293348,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you."
201848,L293347,u5951,m394,HAWK,I wanna know...
201849,L293346,u5946,m394,ANNA,Wha -- you don't want to know...
201850,L293345,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal."
201851,L293344,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?"
201852,L293342,u5951,m394,HAWK,Wha.....
201853,L293341,u5946,m394,ANNA,Trust Leonardo....
201854,L293340,u5951,m394,HAWK,I hope you know what....
201855,L293322,u5951,m394,HAWK,This is too bad to be false.
201856,L293321,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent."
201857,L293320,u5951,m394,HAWK,I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
201858,L293319,u5946,m394,ANNA,Oh Hudson...
201859,L293209,u5951,m394,HAWK,Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum.
201860,L293208,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports."
201861,L293207,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously."
201862,L293194,u5946,m394,ANNA,"You re not ""some guy"" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I...."
201863,L293193,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam..."
201864,L293192,u5946,m394,ANNA,It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
201865,L293191,u5951,m394,HAWK,You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
201866,L293186,u5946,m394,ANNA,It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
201867,L293185,u5951,m394,HAWK,"You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum."
201868,L293184,u5946,m394,ANNA,Where did you get this?
201869,L293183,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Oh.  Well, what's this?"
201870,L293182,u5946,m394,ANNA,I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
201871,L293181,u5951,m394,HAWK,"And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore."
201872,L293180,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Hudson, don't you understand..."
201873,L293091,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it."
201874,L293090,u5951,m394,HAWK,This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
201875,L293088,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid..."
201876,L293087,u5946,m394,ANNA,"The C.I. what?  God, no..."
201877,L293086,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!"
201878,L293085,u5946,m394,ANNA,"For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the ""gas leak"" that supposedly destroyed it."
201879,L293079,u5946,m394,ANNA,"What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?"
201880,L293078,u5951,m394,HAWK,Wha--
201881,L293077,u5946,m394,ANNA,"You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex."
201882,L293076,u5951,m394,HAWK,"It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is...."
201883,L293075,u5951,m394,HAWK,Oh.  No.
201884,L293074,u5946,m394,ANNA,Somebody robbed the Vatican.
201885,L293073,u5951,m394,HAWK,Catholic girls are scary...
201886,L293072,u5946,m394,ANNA,It's also been a long time for me.  I--
201887,L293071,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky."
201888,L293070,u5946,m394,ANNA,I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
201889,L293069,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Oh, I'm so sorry..."
201890,L293068,u5951,m394,HAWK,"tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES."
201891,L293067,u5951,m394,HAWK,Uh....old badminton injury.
201892,L293066,u5946,m394,ANNA,What have you been doing?
201893,L293062,u5951,m394,HAWK,I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....
201894,L293061,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Wow, you were ""in the joint."" ""Doing hard time.""  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners."
201895,L293060,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Let's just say, I never saw E.T."
201896,L293059,u5946,m394,ANNA,How long were you in?
201897,L293058,u5951,m394,HAWK,I was the Warden?
201898,L293057,u5946,m394,ANNA,Prison?
201899,L293056,u5951,m394,HAWK,This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
201900,L293047,u5951,m394,HAWK,I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
201901,L293046,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by...."
201902,L293013,u5951,m394,HAWK,Said.
201903,L293012,u5946,m394,ANNA,Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
201904,L293011,u5951,m394,HAWK,And I'll bring my entourage...
201905,L293010,u5946,m394,ANNA,I'll bring my entire repertoire...
201906,L293009,u5951,m394,HAWK,"God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians...."
201907,L293008,u5946,m394,ANNA,I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
201908,L293007,u5951,m394,HAWK,You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
201909,L293006,u5946,m394,ANNA,Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
201910,L293005,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Oh, you read that."
201911,L293004,u5946,m394,ANNA,Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
201912,L293003,u5951,m394,HAWK,"The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained."
201913,L293002,u5946,m394,ANNA,Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
201914,L293001,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?"
201915,L293000,u5951,m394,HAWK,Could you believe that crazy elephant?
201916,L292999,u5946,m394,ANNA,Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
201917,L292998,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment..."
201918,L292997,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Never, why do you ask?"
201919,L292996,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond."
201920,L292992,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank."
201921,L292991,u5951,m394,HAWK,That's what you theenk.
201922,L292990,u5946,m394,ANNA,"As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more."
201923,L292989,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too..."
201924,L292988,u5946,m394,ANNA,Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
201925,L292916,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Because Danger, Doc, is my middle..."
201926,L292915,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?"
201927,L292914,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners."
201928,L292913,u5946,m394,ANNA,"No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of ""watch out, Anna"" would have done nicely..."
201929,L292912,u5951,m394,HAWK,Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
201930,L292911,u5946,m394,ANNA,"My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that..."
201931,L292900,u5946,m394,ANNA,Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
201932,L292899,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--"
201933,L293103,u5952,m394,KAPLAN,Actually he never told us what it was.
201934,L293102,u5946,m394,ANNA,Cat got his tongue?
201935,L293101,u5952,m394,KAPLAN,"Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat..."
201936,L293100,u5946,m394,ANNA,"Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some ""neat"" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool."
201937,L293099,u5952,m394,KAPLAN,It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
201938,L293097,u5952,m394,KAPLAN,And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
201939,L293096,u5946,m394,ANNA,"When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal..."
201940,L293095,u5952,m394,KAPLAN,"Way to go, Anna."
201941,L292857,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?"
201942,L292856,u5948,m394,CESAR,"Good job, not pretty, but good."
201943,L292741,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Baseball, why?"
201944,L292740,u5948,m394,CESAR,"What's your favorite sport, Hawk?"
201945,L292739,u5951,m394,HAWK,"If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt."
201946,L292738,u5948,m394,CESAR,"Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas..."
201947,L292736,u5951,m394,HAWK,Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
201948,L292735,u5948,m394,CESAR,You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
201949,L292734,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to..."
201950,L292733,u5948,m394,CESAR,"How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, ""endearing."""
201951,L293298,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"Million five, lover..."
201952,L293297,u5949,m394,DARWIN,That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
201953,L293296,u5953,m394,MINERVA,I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
201954,L293241,u5949,m394,DARWIN,So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.
201955,L293240,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"We're here to say, your government was right."
201956,L293239,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children."
201957,L293157,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin."
201958,L293156,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop."
201959,L293155,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!"
201960,L293151,u5953,m394,MINERVA,Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
201961,L293150,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato."
201962,L293117,u5949,m394,DARWIN,I don't care.
201963,L293116,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"No, let me!"
201964,L293114,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"Like a ""cat"", one could say."
201965,L293113,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out."
201966,L292974,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!"
201967,L292973,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!"
201968,L292972,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex."
201969,L292968,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin."
201970,L292967,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem."
201971,L292906,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"Poor baby..... Here, Bunny."
201972,L292905,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere."
201973,L293287,u5951,m394,HAWK,But you're going to tell us anyway...
201974,L293286,u5949,m394,DARWIN,What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
201975,L293161,u5951,m394,HAWK,You want an address on that last one?
201976,L293160,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!"
201977,L293131,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on...."
201978,L293130,u5949,m394,DARWIN,Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
201979,L292963,u5951,m394,HAWK,I guess that's a no.
201980,L292962,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find."
201981,L292961,u5951,m394,HAWK,"If you're pausing for a ""thank you,"" give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?"
201982,L292960,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the ""Sforza"" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out...."
201983,L292959,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it..."
201984,L292958,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words..."
201985,L292951,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead."
201986,L292950,u5951,m394,HAWK,"You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?"
201987,L292949,u5949,m394,DARWIN,"For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?"
201988,L292860,u5950,m394,GATES,So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
201989,L292859,u5951,m394,HAWK,You certainly do.
201990,L292858,u5950,m394,GATES,"All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like."
201991,L292855,u5951,m394,HAWK,Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
201992,L292854,u5950,m394,GATES,Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
201993,L292790,u5950,m394,GATES,"That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con."
201994,L292789,u5951,m394,HAWK,"What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame."
201995,L292787,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase."
201996,L292786,u5950,m394,GATES,Remember that shoe you lost...
201997,L292785,u5951,m394,HAWK,Yes.
201998,L292784,u5950,m394,GATES,Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
201999,L292783,u5951,m394,HAWK,"How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying ""Soitinly."""
202000,L292782,u5950,m394,GATES,"You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges..."
202001,L292781,u5951,m394,HAWK,"The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute."
202002,L292780,u5950,m394,GATES,"The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie."
202003,L292779,u5951,m394,HAWK,What job?
202004,L292778,u5950,m394,GATES,Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
202005,L292777,u5951,m394,HAWK,"The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates."
202006,L292776,u5950,m394,GATES,"Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal..."
202007,L293337,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me."
202008,L293336,u5951,m394,HAWK,And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
202009,L293335,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here...."
202010,L293333,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say ""How could this happen to me?""  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!"
202011,L293332,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?"
202012,L293331,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble."
202013,L293330,u5951,m394,HAWK,You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
202014,L293289,u5951,m394,HAWK,If you think you're getting past me...
202015,L293288,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal."
202016,L293163,u5953,m394,MINERVA,"You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it."
202017,L293162,u5951,m394,HAWK,"Bunny, not you too?"

I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you..."

202161,L294060,u5958,m395,AMY,"They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --"

202172,L293935,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth."
202173,L293934,u5958,m395,AMY,"I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex."
202174,L293933,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways..."
202175,L293932,u5958,m395,AMY,"Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --"
202176,L293931,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched."
202177,L293930,u5958,m395,AMY,"Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --"
202178,L293929,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?"
202179,L293928,u5958,m395,AMY,What a beautiful thought.
202180,L293927,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea."
202181,L293926,u5958,m395,AMY,...The people look like ants.
202182,L293925,u5958,m395,AMY,"Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --"
202183,L293924,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Every year?
202184,L293923,u5958,m395,AMY,"Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year."
202185,L293922,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,You don't say.
202186,L293921,u5958,m395,AMY,"Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar."
202187,L293920,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
202188,L293919,u5958,m395,AMY,Oh yes! In Muncie!
202189,L293918,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"You know, on farm route 17."
202190,L293917,u5958,m395,AMY,...Huh?
202191,L293916,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
202192,L293915,u5958,m395,AMY,...Certain people are --
202193,L293914,u5958,m395,AMY,"Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie..."
202194,L293913,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --"
202195,L293912,u5958,m395,AMY,"I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --"
202196,L293911,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it."
202197,L293910,u5958,m395,AMY,...You do?
202198,L293909,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"I know that, Amy."
202199,L293908,u5958,m395,AMY,"Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary."
202200,L293907,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this."
202201,L293906,u5958,m395,AMY,...I'm sorry.
202202,L293905,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
202203,L293904,u5958,m395,AMY,"Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner."
202204,L293903,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Sid found me the icepack.
202205,L293902,u5958,m395,AMY,Let me look.
202206,L293901,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover."
202207,L293900,u5958,m395,AMY,...What happened?
202208,L293811,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --"
202209,L293810,u5958,m395,AMY,Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
202210,L293809,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?"
202211,L293808,u5958,m395,AMY,Smitty.
202212,L293807,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or..."
202213,L293806,u5958,m395,AMY,"Oh, is that it!"
202214,L293805,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it."
202215,L293804,u5958,m395,AMY,I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
202216,L293803,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean."
202217,L293802,u5958,m395,AMY,Confused?
202218,L293800,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam..."
202219,L293799,u5958,m395,AMY,"Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!"
202220,L293798,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Well, she probably had a deadline..."
202221,L293797,u5958,m395,AMY,"Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man."
202222,L293796,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess."
202223,L293795,u5958,m395,AMY,...Why don't I just type this up...
202224,L293794,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,...You know! For kids!
202225,L293792,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?"
202226,L293791,u5958,m395,AMY,"Well, I --"
202227,L293790,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion."
202228,L293789,u5958,m395,AMY,I'm sure I --
202229,L293788,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?"
202230,L293787,u5958,m395,AMY,"Is that all, Mr. Barnes?"
202231,L293786,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"-- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera."
202232,L293785,u5958,m395,AMY,-- or lack thereof?
202233,L293784,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --"
202234,L293783,u5958,m395,AMY,"Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice."
202235,L293782,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
202236,L293745,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Please! Norville!
202237,L293744,u5958,m395,AMY,"Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --"
202238,L293743,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
202239,L293742,u5958,m395,AMY,"Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!"
202240,L293741,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?"
202241,L293731,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up."
202242,L293730,u5958,m395,AMY,"Oh, no, really, I --"
202243,L293729,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud."
202244,L293726,u5958,m395,AMY,"Why yes, do you know it?"
202245,L293725,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,You're from Muncie?!
202246,L293714,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Mind if I join you?
202247,L293713,u5958,m395,AMY,-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
202248,L293712,u5958,m395,AMY,"No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --"
202249,L293711,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Cigarette?
202250,L293709,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,I myself --
202251,L293708,u5958,m395,AMY,"A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --"
202252,L293707,u5958,m395,AMY,"At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --"
202253,L293706,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --"
202254,L293705,u5958,m395,AMY,What a horrible little person.
202255,L293696,u5958,m395,AMY,I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
202256,L293695,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Hungry, anyway."
202257,L293692,u5958,m395,AMY,"The couch, please."
202258,L293691,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Not at all. You're light as a feather.
202259,L293690,u5958,m395,AMY,I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
202260,L293617,u5964,m395,EDITOR,"Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!"
202261,L293616,u5958,m395,AMY,I filed it yesterday.
202262,L293615,u5964,m395,EDITOR,"Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?"
202263,L293614,u5958,m395,AMY,"...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al."
202264,L293610,u5958,m395,AMY,Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
202265,L293609,u5964,m395,EDITOR,Sez who?
202266,L293608,u5958,m395,AMY,As a three-dollar bill.
202267,L293607,u5964,m395,EDITOR,"Phony, huh?"
202268,L293606,u5958,m395,AMY,I tell ya the guy's a phony.
202269,L294144,u5963,m395,CHIEF,"Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack."
202270,L294143,u5958,m395,AMY,"You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!"
202271,L294142,u5963,m395,CHIEF,"Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --"
202272,L294136,u5958,m395,AMY,Says who?!
202273,L294135,u5963,m395,CHIEF,"Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --"
202274,L294131,u5963,m395,CHIEF,He grins wolfishly.
202275,L294130,u5958,m395,AMY,You can't print that!
202276,L293858,u5958,m395,AMY,It's about a dimwitted editor who --
202277,L293857,u5963,m395,CHIEF,"Watch it, Archer --"
202278,L293856,u5958,m395,AMY,I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
202279,L293855,u5963,m395,CHIEF,Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
202280,L293854,u5958,m395,AMY,Muncie.
202281,L293849,u5958,m395,AMY,I don't know...
202282,L293848,u5963,m395,CHIEF,"You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?"
202283,L293845,u5963,m395,CHIEF,"It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!"
202284,L293844,u5958,m395,AMY,"Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!"
202285,L293843,u5963,m395,CHIEF,I can't print this!
202286,L293477,u5959,m395,ANCIENT SORTER,Forty-eight years...
202287,L293476,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,How long've you been down here?
202288,L293475,u5959,m395,ANCIENT SORTER,"Nooo, I don't guess you will be."
202289,L293474,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long."
202290,L293473,u5959,m395,ANCIENT SORTER,Terrific.
202291,L293469,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"For instance, take a look at this sweet baby..."
202292,L293468,u5959,m395,ANCIENT SORTER,I'm sure you do.
202293,L293467,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"I got big ideas, though!"
202294,L293466,u5959,m395,ANCIENT SORTER,Tell me about it.
202295,L293465,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Ya know, entry level!"
202296,L293464,u5959,m395,ANCIENT SORTER,Terrific.
202297,L293463,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Just got hired today!
202298,L294172,u5960,m395,BARMAN,"Martinis are for squares, man."
202299,L294171,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --"
202300,L294170,u5960,m395,BARMAN,"It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --"
202301,L294169,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
202302,L294168,u5960,m395,BARMAN,"Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol."
202303,L294167,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,I thought you served misfits here!
202304,L294166,u5960,m395,BARMAN,"Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --"
202305,L294165,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!

202315,L294214,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,But Buzz --
202316,L294213,u5962,m395,BUZZ,And Sid says you stole it!

You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?"

202391,L293734,u5966,m395,INTERCOM,Yeah?
202392,L293733,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,...This'll only take a moment.
202393,L293871,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid."
202394,L293870,u5969,m395,MRS. MUSSBURGER,"Well, frankly, I..."
202395,L293868,u5969,m395,MRS. MUSSBURGER,"Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?"
202396,L293867,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,I haven't had --
202397,L293866,u5969,m395,MRS. MUSSBURGER,"I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?"
202398,L293865,u5969,m395,MRS. MUSSBURGER,"Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!"
202399,L293864,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger."
202400,L293863,u5969,m395,MRS. MUSSBURGER,-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
202401,L294124,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,"Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company..."
202402,L294123,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --"
202403,L294122,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,"It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --"
202404,L294121,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"How's that, Sid?"
202405,L294120,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,"Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly."
202406,L294119,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Ya don't say.
202407,L294118,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,"Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud."
202408,L294117,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder."
202409,L293971,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Well... I'm for it...
202410,L293970,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,"...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours."
202411,L293642,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --"
202412,L293641,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,Finally.
202413,L293640,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
202414,L293639,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,"Damnit, where's my car!"
202415,L293638,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --"
202416,L293637,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,"I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!"
202417,L293636,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?"
202418,L293635,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --"
202419,L293634,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,"Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover."
202420,L293625,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,Lobby. We haven't got all day.
202421,L293624,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--"
202422,L293578,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh my God, sir!"
202423,L293577,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,My God! The Bumstead contracts!
202424,L293574,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Sir, my leg is on fire!"
202425,L293573,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
202426,L293571,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"But, sir!"
202427,L293570,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,Not that way! Through the door!
202428,L293568,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh my God, sir!"
202429,L293567,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
202430,L293565,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh my God, sir!"
202431,L293564,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
202432,L293563,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"Oh my God, sir!"
202433,L293562,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
202434,L293561,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,Get out of my sight.
202435,L293560,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,But --
202436,L293559,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,Get your feet off that desk.
202437,L293558,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"But, sir! --"
202438,L293557,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,You're fired.
202439,L293556,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
202440,L293555,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,Not even behind your back?
202441,L293554,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"No, sir."
202442,L293553,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
202443,L293552,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,"Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?"
202444,L293551,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
202445,L293550,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,Hmmm.

202451,L293535,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,"...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --"
202452,L293528,u5971,m395,NORVILLE,You --
202453,L293527,u5970,m395,MUSSBURGER,"You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast."

202504,L296221,u5975,m396,ALMA,"Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell."
202505,L296076,u5976,m396,BETSY,Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
202506,L296075,u5975,m396,ALMA,"A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says ""brioche."""
202507,L296074,u5976,m396,BETSY,What's this?
202508,L296073,u5975,m396,ALMA,"I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll."
202509,L296072,u5976,m396,BETSY,"We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I."
202510,L296071,u5975,m396,ALMA,"She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss."
202511,L296070,u5976,m396,BETSY,"She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?"
202512,L296069,u5975,m396,ALMA,"Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty."
202513,L296068,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Thank you, Alma."
202514,L296067,u5975,m396,ALMA,"I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee."
202515,L296066,u5976,m396,BETSY,"But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me."
202516,L296064,u5975,m396,ALMA,"I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart."
202517,L296063,u5976,m396,BETSY,Thank you for waking me.
202518,L296062,u5975,m396,ALMA,"Good morning, miss."
202519,L296008,u5977,m396,COACHMAN,"If you say, miss.  If you say."
202520,L296007,u5976,m396,BETSY,"But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?"
202521,L296006,u5977,m396,COACHMAN,"If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor."
202522,L296005,u5976,m396,BETSY,You mean a figurehead.
202523,L296004,u5977,m396,COACHMAN,"No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat."
202524,L296003,u5976,m396,BETSY,Alive?
202525,L296002,u5977,m396,COACHMAN,"A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face."
202526,L296001,u5976,m396,BETSY,Ti-Misery?  What's that?
202527,L296000,u5977,m396,COACHMAN,"Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery."
202528,L296348,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them."
202529,L296347,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you."
202530,L296346,u5976,m396,BETSY,Mrs. Rand...
202531,L296326,u5976,m396,BETSY,"That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand."
202532,L296325,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here."
202533,L296262,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy."
202534,L296261,u5976,m396,BETSY,But you didn't have to come up here.
202535,L296260,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on."
202536,L296259,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
202537,L296258,u5976,m396,BETSY,But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
202538,L296257,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
202539,L296256,u5976,m396,BETSY,"But, Mrs. Rand --"
202540,L296255,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
202541,L296254,u5976,m396,BETSY,Mrs. Rand.
202542,L296244,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
202543,L296243,u5976,m396,BETSY,"I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been ""mindless""..."
202544,L296242,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?"
202545,L296241,u5976,m396,BETSY,"I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?"
202546,L296240,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?"
202547,L296239,u5976,m396,BETSY,You don't believe in it?
202548,L296238,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
202549,L296237,u5976,m396,BETSY,"You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand."
202550,L296236,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
202551,L296165,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
202552,L296164,u5976,m396,BETSY,I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
202553,L296163,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
202554,L296162,u5976,m396,BETSY,I'd love to.
202555,L296161,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking."
202556,L296160,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are."
202557,L296159,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me."
202558,L296158,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --"
202559,L296157,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together."
202560,L296156,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Oh, Mrs. Rand --"
202561,L296155,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother."
202562,L296149,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,Ti-Joseph?
202563,L296148,u5976,m396,BETSY,I'm afraid so.
202564,L296147,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,I think you need some help.
202565,L296341,u5976,m396,BETSY,"I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell."
202566,L296340,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
202567,L296206,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind."
202568,L296205,u5976,m396,BETSY,I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
202569,L296099,u5976,m396,BETSY,Thank you.
202570,L296098,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell."
202571,L296096,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever."
202572,L296095,u5976,m396,BETSY,Is this disease common in the tropics?
202573,L296094,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,I've never heard of a cure.
202574,L296093,u5976,m396,BETSY,She can never be cured?
202575,L296092,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing."
202576,L296091,u5976,m396,BETSY,Does she suffer?
202577,L295987,u5983,m396,WILKENS,"That's rather nice, isn't it?"
202578,L295986,u5976,m396,BETSY,But it's so far away...
202579,L295985,u5983,m396,WILKENS,"A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know."
202580,L295984,u5976,m396,BETSY,The West Indies?
202581,L295983,u5983,m396,WILKENS,"No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies."
202582,L295982,u5976,m396,BETSY,"That will mean another interview, won't it?"
202583,L295981,u5983,m396,WILKENS,I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
202584,L295980,u5976,m396,BETSY,That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
202585,L295979,u5983,m396,WILKENS,"Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month."
202586,L295978,u5976,m396,BETSY,"They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training."
202587,L295976,u5976,m396,BETSY,At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
202588,L295975,u5983,m396,WILKENS,Where were you trained?
202589,L295974,u5976,m396,BETSY,Yes.
202590,L295973,u5983,m396,WILKENS,You're single?
202591,L296385,u5982,m396,RAND,"Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful."
202592,L296384,u5976,m396,BETSY,"No, Wes."
202593,L296380,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep."
202594,L296379,u5982,m396,RAND,"You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!"
202595,L296378,u5976,m396,BETSY,"But she's not dead, Wes."
202596,L296377,u5982,m396,RAND,She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
202597,L296376,u5976,m396,BETSY,Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
202598,L296375,u5982,m396,RAND,"She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time..."
202599,L296374,u5976,m396,BETSY,I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
202600,L296373,u5982,m396,RAND,Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
202601,L296372,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Of course, Wes."
202602,L296371,u5982,m396,RAND,"Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?"
202603,L296141,u5982,m396,RAND,"One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  ""You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?""  What he could do to that word ""beautiful."" That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists."
202604,L296140,u5976,m396,BETSY,"I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?"
202605,L296139,u5982,m396,RAND,"That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long."
202606,L296138,u5976,m396,BETSY,That doesn't sound like him.
202607,L296137,u5982,m396,RAND,Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
202608,L296136,u5976,m396,BETSY,I wish I hadn't heard --
202609,L296135,u5982,m396,RAND,Did you hear what he sang?
202610,L296134,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Don't let it bother you so, Wes."
202611,L296125,u5976,m396,BETSY,Wait. I want to listen.
202612,L296124,u5982,m396,RAND,"Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --"
202613,L296122,u5976,m396,BETSY,I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
202614,L296121,u5982,m396,RAND,How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
202615,L296120,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces."
202616,L296119,u5982,m396,RAND,What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
202617,L296118,u5976,m396,BETSY,It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
202618,L296117,u5982,m396,RAND,"Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained."
202619,L296116,u5982,m396,RAND,"By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too."
202620,L296115,u5976,m396,BETSY,But don't you have to work?
202621,L296114,u5982,m396,RAND,Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  I'd better come along and show you the town.
202622,L296113,u5976,m396,BETSY,"I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?"
202623,L296112,u5982,m396,RAND,But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
202624,L296111,u5976,m396,BETSY,It's my day off.
202625,L296110,u5982,m396,RAND,Where do you think you're going?
202626,L296035,u5982,m396,RAND,It'll wait.
202627,L296034,u5976,m396,BETSY,Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
202628,L296033,u5982,m396,RAND,"Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it."
202629,L296032,u5976,m396,BETSY,I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
202630,L296031,u5982,m396,RAND,"Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm."
202631,L296030,u5976,m396,BETSY,Mr. Holland?
202632,L296029,u5982,m396,RAND,Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
202633,L296028,u5976,m396,BETSY,Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
202634,L296027,u5982,m396,RAND,"As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me."
202635,L296025,u5982,m396,RAND,"We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children."
202636,L296024,u5976,m396,BETSY,I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
202637,L296023,u5982,m396,RAND,I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
202638,L296022,u5976,m396,BETSY,"-- But, you're an American?"
202639,L296020,u5982,m396,RAND,My brother's wife.
202640,L296019,u5976,m396,BETSY,Thank you.  But who sits there?
202641,L296018,u5982,m396,RAND,And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
202642,L296017,u5976,m396,BETSY,I like her already.
202643,L296016,u5982,m396,RAND,"No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her."
202644,L296015,u5976,m396,BETSY,Is she a doctor?
202645,L296014,u5982,m396,RAND,"And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary."
202646,L296013,u5976,m396,BETSY,Yes -- on the boat.
202647,L296012,u5982,m396,RAND,"It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him."
202648,L296322,u5976,m396,BETSY,"I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand."
202649,L296321,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
202650,L296317,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Yes.
202651,L296316,u5976,m396,BETSY,You want that?
202652,L296315,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one."
202653,L296314,u5976,m396,BETSY,That's past -- that's over and done with...
202654,L296313,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her."
202655,L296312,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you."
202656,L296311,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away."
202657,L296310,u5976,m396,BETSY,You wanted to warn me...
202658,L296309,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
202659,L296308,u5976,m396,BETSY,I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
202660,L296307,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her."
202661,L296306,u5976,m396,BETSY,"You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul."
202662,L296305,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
202663,L296304,u5976,m396,BETSY,I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
202664,L296277,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,I hated her.
202665,L296276,u5976,m396,BETSY,She was beautiful.
202666,L296275,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking."
202667,L296273,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --"
202668,L296272,u5976,m396,BETSY,You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
202669,L296271,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
202670,L296270,u5976,m396,BETSY,I told you.
202671,L296269,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
202672,L296268,u5976,m396,BETSY,I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
202673,L296267,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Help me? How?
202674,L296266,u5976,m396,BETSY,I wanted to help you.
202675,L296217,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing."
202676,L296216,u5976,m396,BETSY,"And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing."
202677,L296215,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, ""Paul, darling...""  The whole thing beginning all over again..."
202678,L296214,u5976,m396,BETSY,I imagined this so differently...
202679,L296213,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"Don't take it to heart, Betsy."
202680,L296212,u5976,m396,BETSY,"She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all."
202681,L296211,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Well?
202682,L296199,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
202683,L296198,u5976,m396,BETSY,You didn't drive her mad.
202684,L296197,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
202685,L296196,u5976,m396,BETSY,I love Fort Holland.
202686,L296195,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal."
202687,L296194,u5976,m396,BETSY,"I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how."
202688,L296193,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Why did you come in here?
202689,L296192,u5976,m396,BETSY,"I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently."
202690,L296191,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,I often do.
202691,L296190,u5976,m396,BETSY,I heard you playing.
202692,L296180,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people."
202693,L296179,u5976,m396,BETSY,You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
202694,L296178,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother."
202695,L296177,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is."
202696,L296176,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
202697,L296175,u5976,m396,BETSY,But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
202698,L296174,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain."
202699,L296173,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --"
202700,L296172,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Wesley can be very entertaining.
202701,L296171,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Well, I had a good time up to a point."
202702,L296170,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first ""day off,"" too."
202703,L296169,u5976,m396,BETSY,Good morning.
202704,L296168,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"Good morning, Miss Connell."
202705,L296108,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
202706,L296107,u5976,m396,BETSY,I've never given it much thought.
202707,L296106,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,And charming?
202708,L296105,u5976,m396,BETSY,I suppose so.  Yes.
202709,L296103,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Many people thought her beautiful.
202710,L296102,u5976,m396,BETSY,Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
202711,L296101,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?"
202712,L296087,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies."
202713,L296086,u5976,m396,BETSY,I'm sorry...
202714,L296085,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,A mental case?
202715,L296084,u5976,m396,BETSY,Of course not!
202716,L296083,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
202717,L296082,u5976,m396,BETSY,Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
202718,L296081,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?"
202719,L296080,u5976,m396,BETSY,"If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place."
202720,L296079,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"That's hard to believe, after what happened last night."
202721,L296078,u5976,m396,BETSY,I am not a frightened girl.
202722,L296077,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
202723,L296060,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
202724,L296059,u5976,m396,BETSY,A figure of St. Sebastian.
202725,L296058,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
202726,L296057,u5976,m396,BETSY,Why was the maid crying?
202727,L296050,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
202728,L296049,u5976,m396,BETSY,I heard someone crying -- a woman --
202729,L296041,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work."
202730,L296040,u5976,m396,BETSY,Can't I take it for you?
202731,L296038,u5976,m396,BETSY,"Yes, thank you."
202732,L296037,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Have the servants made you comfortable?
202733,L295995,u5976,m396,BETSY,You can't really believe that.
202734,L295994,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
202735,L295993,u5976,m396,BETSY,"You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland."
202736,L295992,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,It is not beautiful.
202737,L296361,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil."
202738,L296360,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
202739,L296359,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons."
202740,L296358,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever."
202741,L296357,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
202742,L296356,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
202743,L296355,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?"
202744,L296352,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods..."
202745,L296351,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
202746,L296296,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it."
202747,L296295,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,Wesley!
202748,L296288,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor."
202749,L296287,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
202750,L296286,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before."
202751,L296363,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final."
202752,L296362,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother."
202753,L296338,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess."
202754,L296337,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand."
202755,L296336,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"In other words, I'm on trial."
202756,L296335,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it."
202757,L296334,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,Investigation of what?
202758,L296333,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation."
202759,L296332,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,What about her?
202760,L296331,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid."
202761,L296330,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,An accident at the mill?
202762,L296281,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned."
202763,L296280,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there."
202764,L296209,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,"Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!"
202765,L296208,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
202766,L296207,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,I don't know -- I don't know--
202767,L296204,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
202768,L296203,u5978,m396,DR. MAXWELL,"Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case."
202769,L296202,u5979,m396,HOLLAND,All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
202770,L296301,u5982,m396,RAND,"Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!"
202771,L296300,u5980,m396,JEFFRIES,"That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one."
202772,L296299,u5982,m396,RAND,Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
202773,L296298,u5980,m396,JEFFRIES,Why?
202774,L296297,u5982,m396,RAND,I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
202775,L296292,u5982,m396,RAND,It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
202776,L296291,u5980,m396,JEFFRIES,"I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy."
202777,L296290,u5982,m396,RAND,To the asylum?
202778,L296289,u5980,m396,JEFFRIES,"If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas."
202779,L296285,u5980,m396,JEFFRIES,No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
202780,L296284,u5982,m396,RAND,"Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble."
202781,L296354,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie."
202782,L296353,u5982,m396,RAND,That isn't true.  You never understood her.
202783,L296345,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there."
202784,L296344,u5982,m396,RAND,"Are you going to lie for him, Mother?"
202785,L296343,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,"You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it."
202786,L296342,u5982,m396,RAND,"We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!"
202787,L296329,u5982,m396,RAND,Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
202788,L296328,u5981,m396,MRS. RAND,Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
202789,L297156,u5988,m397,GEORGE,In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
202790,L297155,u5984,m397,BEN,"Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?"
202791,L297154,u5988,m397,GEORGE,"Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy."
202792,L297153,u5988,m397,GEORGE,"Yeah, good."
202793,L297152,u5984,m397,BEN,"Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey."
202794,L297151,u5988,m397,GEORGE,"Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?"
202795,L297150,u5984,m397,BEN,"Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?"
202796,L297149,u5988,m397,GEORGE,"Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!"
202797,L297148,u5984,m397,BEN,"Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?"
202798,L297147,u5988,m397,GEORGE,Benjie!
202799,L296759,u5984,m397,BEN,Up the organization!  Bastard.
202800,L296758,u5988,m397,GEORGE,Right o'.
202801,L296757,u5984,m397,BEN,Got a meeting uptown.
202802,L296756,u5988,m397,GEORGE,"Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?"
202803,L296755,u5984,m397,BEN,"Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top."
202804,L296754,u5988,m397,GEORGE,"Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?"
202805,L296753,u5984,m397,BEN,"Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?"
202806,L296752,u5988,m397,GEORGE,"And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?"
202807,L297392,u5984,m397,BEN,Paul? Yeah. You think --
202808,L297391,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --"
202809,L297389,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Ben, I don't think he wants us here."
202810,L297388,u5984,m397,BEN,"Yeah. Well, we can just --"
202811,L297387,u5986,m397,ELENA,The phone's out.
202812,L297386,u5984,m397,BEN,Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
202813,L297319,u5986,m397,ELENA,We'll talk in the morning.
202814,L297318,u5984,m397,BEN,Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
202815,L297317,u5986,m397,ELENA,You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
202816,L297315,u5986,m397,ELENA,Ben.
202817,L297314,u5984,m397,BEN,I'll drive you --
202818,L297313,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?"
202819,L297312,u5984,m397,BEN,Elena.
202820,L297262,u5986,m397,ELENA,We're not going anywhere.
202821,L297261,u5984,m397,BEN,Ready to go?
202822,L297145,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you."
202823,L297144,u5984,m397,BEN,"Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up."
202824,L297143,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession."
202825,L297142,u5984,m397,BEN,"Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --"
202826,L297141,u5984,m397,BEN,Elena.
202827,L297140,u5986,m397,ELENA,"You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --"
202828,L297139,u5984,m397,BEN,I'm not.
202829,L297138,u5986,m397,ELENA,You're not going to --
202830,L297137,u5984,m397,BEN,"I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --"
202831,L297136,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Damn it, Ben --"
202832,L297135,u5984,m397,BEN,I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
202833,L297134,u5986,m397,ELENA,Well?
202834,L297133,u5984,m397,BEN,"Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?"
202835,L297132,u5986,m397,ELENA,That this was going to be a key party?
202836,L297131,u5984,m397,BEN,"I know, I know. I had no idea --"
202837,L297130,u5986,m397,ELENA,This just isn't the best moment for this.
202838,L297129,u5984,m397,BEN,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot."
202839,L297128,u5986,m397,ELENA,In the car.
202840,L297127,u5984,m397,BEN,You've...
202841,L297115,u5986,m397,ELENA,Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
202842,L297114,u5984,m397,BEN,"Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean."
202843,L297113,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like."
202844,L297111,u5984,m397,BEN,"What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here."
202845,L297110,u5986,m397,ELENA,If you're going to insult me --
202846,L297109,u5984,m397,BEN,"Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?"
202847,L297108,u5986,m397,ELENA,It's a starting place.
202848,L297107,u5984,m397,BEN,Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
202849,L297106,u5986,m397,ELENA,Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
202850,L297105,u5984,m397,BEN,"Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --"
202851,L297104,u5986,m397,ELENA,I'm not surprised.
202852,L297103,u5984,m397,BEN,"Elena, what are you're talking about?"
202853,L297102,u5986,m397,ELENA,Don't be dim.
202854,L297101,u5984,m397,BEN,What do you mean?
202855,L297100,u5986,m397,ELENA,"It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup."
202856,L297099,u5984,m397,BEN,What's on your mind? Don't --
202857,L297098,u5986,m397,ELENA,I have no idea.
202858,L297097,u5984,m397,BEN,You think I --
202859,L297096,u5986,m397,ELENA,Don't start.
202860,L297095,u5984,m397,BEN,"No advice from the experts, huh?"
202861,L297094,u5986,m397,ELENA,See for yourself.
202862,L297093,u5984,m397,BEN,What's for dessert?
202863,L297082,u5986,m397,ELENA,That one.
202864,L297081,u5984,m397,BEN,"Yeah, that one."
202865,L297080,u5986,m397,ELENA,Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
202866,L297079,u5984,m397,BEN,"Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat."
202867,L297078,u5986,m397,ELENA,So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
202868,L297077,u5984,m397,BEN,"I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice."
202869,L297076,u5986,m397,ELENA,Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
202870,L297075,u5984,m397,BEN,"In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -"
202871,L297073,u5984,m397,BEN,You go dry off now.
202872,L297072,u5986,m397,ELENA,Dinner in ten minutes.
202873,L297018,u5984,m397,BEN,Stuffed and baking.
202874,L297017,u5986,m397,ELENA,The turkey in?
202875,L296974,u5986,m397,ELENA,Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
202876,L296973,u5984,m397,BEN,What?
202877,L296972,u5986,m397,ELENA,That shirt?
202878,L296971,u5984,m397,BEN,Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
202879,L296969,u5984,m397,BEN,"Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot."
202880,L296968,u5986,m397,ELENA,"I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children."
202881,L296967,u5984,m397,BEN,You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
202882,L296966,u5986,m397,ELENA,"No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --"
202883,L296965,u5984,m397,BEN,Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
202884,L296964,u5986,m397,ELENA,"I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know..."
202885,L296963,u5984,m397,BEN,You crying?
202886,L296962,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--"
202887,L296961,u5984,m397,BEN,"You know Elena, I've been thinking--"
202888,L296960,u5986,m397,ELENA,I... I think I am...
202889,L296959,u5984,m397,BEN,I do. I'm -- are you...?
202890,L296958,u5986,m397,ELENA,Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
202891,L296957,u5984,m397,BEN,"Um, yes."
202892,L296956,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?"
202893,L296955,u5984,m397,BEN,You all right there?
202894,L296852,u5986,m397,ELENA,Hmm. Good night.
202895,L296851,u5984,m397,BEN,"Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?"
202896,L296849,u5984,m397,BEN,Rough day. Good night.
202897,L296848,u5986,m397,ELENA,So early?
202898,L296847,u5984,m397,BEN,"I'm, uh, going to bed."
202899,L296846,u5984,m397,BEN,"Well, it is a neighborhood tradition."
202900,L296845,u5986,m397,ELENA,What do you think?
202901,L296844,u5984,m397,BEN,You want to go?
202902,L296843,u5986,m397,ELENA,The Halfords have invited us again this year.
202903,L296747,u5986,m397,ELENA,Good night.
202904,L296746,u5984,m397,BEN,Good night.
202905,L296744,u5984,m397,BEN,Elena.
202906,L296743,u5986,m397,ELENA,"-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --"
202907,L296742,u5984,m397,BEN,"Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that ""I'm OK. You're OK"" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --"
202908,L296741,u5986,m397,ELENA,"It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you."
202909,L296740,u5984,m397,BEN,"Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them."
202910,L296739,u5986,m397,ELENA,So maybe you'll come too?
202911,L296738,u5984,m397,BEN,"Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our..."
202912,L296737,u5984,m397,BEN,Why shouldn't she be?
202913,L296736,u5986,m397,ELENA,"I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?"
202914,L296735,u5984,m397,BEN,That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
202915,L296734,u5986,m397,ELENA,"I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens."
202916,L296733,u5984,m397,BEN,I wasn't star--
202917,L296732,u5986,m397,ELENA,You're staring at me.
202918,L296699,u5984,m397,BEN,And as usual no one believed me...
202919,L296698,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --"
202920,L296674,u5984,m397,BEN,Gotcha.
202921,L296673,u5986,m397,ELENA,No thank you. We should be off.
202922,L296672,u5984,m397,BEN,"OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?"
202923,L297090,u5984,m397,BEN,Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
202924,L297089,u5996,m397,PAUL,Libbets. Libbets Casey.
202925,L297088,u5984,m397,BEN,Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
202926,L297084,u5984,m397,BEN,Stay out of trouble.
202927,L297083,u5996,m397,PAUL,See you.
202928,L297002,u5984,m397,BEN,Thanks.
202929,L297001,u5996,m397,PAUL,Sure dad.
202930,L297000,u5984,m397,BEN,"Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that."
202931,L296999,u5984,m397,BEN,All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
202932,L296998,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Uh, dad, you know I'm 16."
202933,L296997,u5984,m397,BEN,"Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up."
202934,L296995,u5984,m397,BEN,"Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --"
202935,L296994,u5996,m397,PAUL,About?
202936,L296993,u5984,m397,BEN,"You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --"
202937,L296992,u5996,m397,PAUL,Yeah.
202938,L296991,u5984,m397,BEN,"Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?"
202939,L296990,u5996,m397,PAUL,Hnnn.
202940,L296989,u5984,m397,BEN,Anyone special? You know...
202941,L296988,u5996,m397,PAUL,Fine.
202942,L296987,u5984,m397,BEN,Grades?
202943,L296986,u5996,m397,PAUL,Good.
202944,L296985,u5984,m397,BEN,Classes?
202945,L296984,u5996,m397,PAUL,All right.
202946,L296983,u5984,m397,BEN,So how's school treating you?
202947,L296661,u5984,m397,BEN,"Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should..."
202948,L296660,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --"
202949,L296659,u5984,m397,BEN,Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
202950,L296658,u5996,m397,PAUL,I'm fine dad.
202951,L296657,u5984,m397,BEN,Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
202952,L296656,u5996,m397,PAUL,Hi dad.
202953,L297166,u5984,m397,BEN,I just can't believe you could be so --
202954,L297165,u5991,m397,JANEY,"How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --"
202955,L297164,u5984,m397,BEN,"Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --"
202956,L297163,u5991,m397,JANEY,"Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy."
202957,L297162,u5984,m397,BEN,What?
202958,L297161,u5991,m397,JANEY,A prior engagement overcame me.
202959,L297160,u5984,m397,BEN,"Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?"
202960,L297159,u5991,m397,JANEY,What are you talking about?
202961,L297158,u5984,m397,BEN,"Damn right, but where the hell were you?"
202962,L297157,u5991,m397,JANEY,"Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are."
202963,L297037,u5984,m397,BEN,Right. Gotcha.
202964,L297036,u5991,m397,JANEY,Birth control.
202965,L297035,u5984,m397,BEN,Huh?
202966,L297033,u5984,m397,BEN,"Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge."
202967,L297032,u5991,m397,JANEY,"Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her."
202968,L297031,u5984,m397,BEN,"Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?"
202969,L297029,u5991,m397,JANEY,In a bit.
202970,L297028,u5984,m397,BEN,"After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?"
202971,L297027,u5991,m397,JANEY,Here.
202972,L296819,u5984,m397,BEN,Gotcha.
202973,L296818,u5991,m397,JANEY,You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
202974,L296817,u5984,m397,BEN,You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
202975,L296816,u5991,m397,JANEY,You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
202976,L296815,u5984,m397,BEN,Yeah?
202977,L296814,u5991,m397,JANEY,Ben--
202978,L296813,u5984,m397,BEN,"It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --"
202979,L297394,u5984,m397,BEN,C'mon.
202980,L297393,u5999,m397,WENDY,He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
202981,L297070,u5999,m397,WENDY,Yeah.
202982,L297069,u5984,m397,BEN,Your toes cold?
202983,L297068,u5984,m397,BEN,"I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess..."
202984,L297067,u5999,m397,WENDY,Huh?
202985,L297066,u5984,m397,BEN,"Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all."
202986,L297065,u5984,m397,BEN,"I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home."
202987,L297064,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff."
202988,L297063,u5984,m397,BEN,Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
202989,L297062,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Talking to me, dad?"
202990,L297059,u5984,m397,BEN,"What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --"
202991,L297058,u5999,m397,WENDY,"What do you think we're doing, dad?"
202992,L297057,u5984,m397,BEN,What the hell are you kids doing down here?
202993,L297026,u5984,m397,BEN,Jesus all right enough!
202994,L297025,u5999,m397,WENDY,... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
202995,L296982,u5999,m397,WENDY,Nothing.
202996,L296981,u5984,m397,BEN,What you been up to?
202997,L296980,u5999,m397,WENDY,Nah.
202998,L296979,u5984,m397,BEN,I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
202999,L296731,u5984,m397,BEN,Good night kiddo.
203000,L296730,u5999,m397,WENDY,Good-night dad.
203001,L296727,u5984,m397,BEN,If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
203002,L296726,u5999,m397,WENDY,Fascist!
203003,L296725,u5984,m397,BEN,Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
203004,L296724,u5999,m397,WENDY,Dad stop it!
203005,L296907,u5990,m397,HAROLD,I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
203006,L296906,u5984,m397,BEN,That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
203007,L296905,u5990,m397,HAROLD,"Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever."
203008,L296904,u5984,m397,BEN,What?
203009,L296903,u5990,m397,HAROLD,"Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her."
203010,L296902,u5984,m397,BEN,Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
203011,L296901,u5990,m397,HAROLD,It was all junk!
203012,L296900,u5984,m397,BEN,"Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --"
203013,L296899,u5990,m397,HAROLD,It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
203014,L296782,u5984,m397,BEN,But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
203015,L296781,u5990,m397,HAROLD,But what?
203016,L296780,u5984,m397,BEN,But...
203017,L296779,u5990,m397,HAROLD,"-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance."
203018,L296778,u5984,m397,BEN,-- 73
203019,L296777,u5990,m397,HAROLD,"That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --"
203020,L296776,u5984,m397,BEN,-- What advice? You never --
203021,L296775,u5990,m397,HAROLD,"-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --"
203022,L296774,u5984,m397,BEN,"But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --"
203023,L296773,u5990,m397,HAROLD,"-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --"
203024,L296772,u5984,m397,BEN,"Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --"
203025,L296771,u5990,m397,HAROLD,"Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --"
203026,L296770,u5984,m397,BEN,"Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --"
203027,L296769,u5984,m397,BEN,"You know, dah--"
203028,L296768,u5990,m397,HAROLD,"Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?"
203029,L296767,u5984,m397,BEN,"I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --"
203030,L296766,u5990,m397,HAROLD,That's besides the point.
203031,L296765,u5984,m397,BEN,-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
203032,L296764,u5990,m397,HAROLD,"And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --"
203033,L296763,u5984,m397,BEN,"We don't have to always go to your club, dad."
203034,L297174,u5984,m397,BEN,"Darn it, Dave."
203035,L297173,u5989,m397,GORMAN,"Don't fret, Benjie, it's --"
203036,L297172,u5984,m397,BEN,It's what?
203037,L297171,u5989,m397,GORMAN,Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
203038,L297170,u5984,m397,BEN,Good shit.
203039,L297168,u5984,m397,BEN,Thanks for the advice Dave.
203040,L297167,u5989,m397,GORMAN,Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
203041,L296892,u5985,m397,DOROTHY,And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
203042,L296891,u5986,m397,ELENA,I suppose we'll make an appearance.
203043,L296890,u5985,m397,DOROTHY,"Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?"
203044,L296712,u5985,m397,DOROTHY,It was lovely!
203045,L296711,u5986,m397,ELENA,Thank you Janey.
203046,L296708,u5985,m397,DOROTHY,"You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic."
203047,L296707,u5986,m397,ELENA,A key party?
203048,L296706,u5985,m397,DOROTHY,And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
203049,L297374,u5992,m397,JIM,Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
203050,L297373,u5986,m397,ELENA,Sure. Maybe coffee.
203051,L297372,u5992,m397,JIM,"You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room."
203052,L297331,u5992,m397,JIM,"Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here."
203053,L297330,u5986,m397,ELENA,Yeah. You?
203054,L297329,u5992,m397,JIM,You okay?
203055,L297311,u5992,m397,JIM,Of course.
203056,L297310,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?"
203057,L297309,u5992,m397,JIM,That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
203058,L297308,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Well, we can talk about it."
203059,L297307,u5992,m397,JIM,"Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --"
203060,L297306,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city."
203061,L297305,u5992,m397,JIM,"Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --"
203062,L297301,u5992,m397,JIM,"Nah, that wasn't in the contract."
203063,L297300,u5986,m397,ELENA,Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
203064,L297299,u5992,m397,JIM,What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
203065,L297298,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --"
203066,L297297,u5986,m397,ELENA,"My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all."
203067,L297296,u5992,m397,JIM,"Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?"
203068,L297295,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --"
203069,L297294,u5992,m397,JIM,You want coffee or something?
203070,L297293,u5992,m397,JIM,"Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really."
203071,L297292,u5986,m397,ELENA,You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
203072,L297291,u5992,m397,JIM,"Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening."
203073,L297290,u5986,m397,ELENA,Let me.
203074,L297289,u5992,m397,JIM,"Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?"
203075,L297382,u5986,m397,ELENA,It'll warm you up.
203076,L297381,u5999,m397,WENDY,I don't like coffee.
203077,L297122,u5986,m397,ELENA,Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
203078,L297121,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know."
203079,L297120,u5986,m397,ELENA,What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
203080,L297119,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt."
203081,L297118,u5986,m397,ELENA,I suppose. Why?
203082,L297117,u5999,m397,WENDY,Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
203083,L297116,u5986,m397,ELENA,We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
203084,L296841,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner."
203085,L296840,u5999,m397,WENDY,"I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in."
203086,L296839,u5986,m397,ELENA,I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
203087,L296838,u5999,m397,WENDY,They need the money for my band uniform at school.
203088,L296837,u5986,m397,ELENA,Oh Wendy.
203089,L296836,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --"
203090,L296835,u5986,m397,ELENA,We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
203091,L296834,u5999,m397,WENDY,"I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --"
203092,L296833,u5986,m397,ELENA,The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
203093,L296832,u5999,m397,WENDY,You're not a psycho!
203094,L296831,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows."
203095,L296830,u5999,m397,WENDY,Mom. Are you ok?
203096,L296829,u5986,m397,ELENA,Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
203097,L296827,u5999,m397,WENDY,We were just riding around.
203098,L296826,u5986,m397,ELENA,Mikey Williams?
203099,L296825,u5999,m397,WENDY,Nobody.
203100,L296824,u5986,m397,ELENA,Who?
203101,L296823,u5999,m397,WENDY,With Mikey?
203102,L296822,u5986,m397,ELENA,I saw you on your bike today.
203103,L296821,u5986,m397,ELENA,Hi Wendy.
203104,L296820,u5999,m397,WENDY,Hi mom.
203105,L296921,u5991,m397,JANEY,None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
203106,L296920,u5986,m397,ELENA,Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
203107,L296919,u5991,m397,JANEY,Here you are.
203108,L296918,u5991,m397,JANEY,You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
203109,L296917,u5986,m397,ELENA,"I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --"
203110,L296916,u5991,m397,JANEY,Educated guess.
203111,L296915,u5986,m397,ELENA,How'd you know?
203112,L296914,u5991,m397,JANEY,Social work?
203113,L296913,u5986,m397,ELENA,I'm thinking of going back to school.
203114,L296912,u5991,m397,JANEY,It's not like we're too busy.
203115,L296911,u5986,m397,ELENA,I used to know how to cook.
203116,L296910,u5991,m397,JANEY,Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
203117,L296909,u5986,m397,ELENA,Thanks again. For the dinner.
203118,L296705,u5986,m397,ELENA,Of course.
203119,L296704,u5991,m397,JANEY,It's really quite all right.
203120,L296703,u5986,m397,ELENA,Oh.
203121,L296702,u5991,m397,JANEY,I insist.  Don't touch them.
203122,L296701,u5986,m397,ELENA,It's not a bother.
203123,L296700,u5991,m397,JANEY,Please don't.
203124,L297218,u5986,m397,ELENA,I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
203125,L297217,u5997,m397,PHILIP,Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
203126,L297216,u5986,m397,ELENA,You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
203127,L297215,u5997,m397,PHILIP,Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
203128,L297214,u5986,m397,ELENA,Reverend Edwards.
203129,L296897,u5997,m397,PHILIP,That I will indeed.
203130,L296896,u5986,m397,ELENA,I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
203131,L296895,u5997,m397,PHILIP,"I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?"
203132,L296889,u5997,m397,PHILIP,Ouch.
203133,L296888,u5986,m397,ELENA,And you're still trying to get me into bed.
203134,L296887,u5997,m397,PHILIP,Now you are being rude.
203135,L296886,u5986,m397,ELENA,But not too ashamed.
203136,L296885,u5997,m397,PHILIP,"You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself."
203137,L296884,u5986,m397,ELENA,I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
203138,L296883,u5997,m397,PHILIP,"If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --"
203139,L296882,u5986,m397,ELENA,I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
203140,L296881,u5997,m397,PHILIP,Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
203141,L296880,u5986,m397,ELENA,That's right.
203142,L296879,u5997,m397,PHILIP,You ask what the point is?
203143,L296878,u5986,m397,ELENA,All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
203144,L296877,u5997,m397,PHILIP,"-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self."
203145,L296876,u5986,m397,ELENA,"You're saying that Christ is the child, and --"
203146,L296875,u5997,m397,PHILIP,"In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology."
203147,L296799,u5997,m397,PHILIP,Forget how to ride a bike.
203148,L296798,u5986,m397,ELENA,Forget what?
203149,L296797,u5997,m397,PHILIP,They say you never forget.
203150,L296796,u5986,m397,ELENA,My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
203151,L296795,u5997,m397,PHILIP,"Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --"
203152,L296794,u5986,m397,ELENA,"I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --"
203153,L296793,u5997,m397,PHILIP,"It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --"
203154,L296788,u5997,m397,PHILIP,No need to make excuses --
203155,L296787,u5986,m397,ELENA,"Yes, it was -- I ended up --"
203156,L296786,u5997,m397,PHILIP,Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
203157,L296785,u5986,m397,ELENA,Yes.
203158,L296784,u5997,m397,PHILIP,"Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?"
203159,L297227,u5996,m397,PAUL,One for you and one for me.
203160,L297226,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
203161,L297225,u5996,m397,PAUL,Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
203162,L297224,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
203163,L297223,u5996,m397,PAUL,And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?
203164,L297191,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,Moisture! Moisture!
203165,L297190,u5996,m397,PAUL,Huh?
203166,L297186,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"All will be revealed, baby."
203167,L297185,u5996,m397,PAUL,Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
203168,L297184,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff."
203169,L296651,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --"
203170,L296650,u5996,m397,PAUL,Shit. You're not planning --
203171,L296649,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,Am I right or am I right?
203172,L296648,u5996,m397,PAUL,What do you mean?
203173,L296647,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,Aha! I could sense the vibe.
203174,L296646,u5996,m397,PAUL,What?
203175,L296645,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"Um, Libbets Casey."
203176,L296644,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up."
203177,L296643,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,Do what?
203178,L296642,u5996,m397,PAUL,How can you do that man?
203179,L296640,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned."
203180,L296639,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Flame on, asshole."
203181,L296638,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you."
203182,L296637,u5996,m397,PAUL,Where you going?
203183,L296636,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,See ya.
203184,L296635,u5996,m397,PAUL,No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
203185,L296615,u5996,m397,PAUL,I gotta get to English class.
203186,L296614,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?"
203187,L296613,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields."
203188,L296612,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
203189,L296611,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick."
203190,L296610,u5996,m397,PAUL,I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
203191,L296609,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"Arise and shine, young Hood."
203192,L297233,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,Let's see!
203193,L297232,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway."
203194,L297229,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?"
203195,L297228,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,No candy for me?
203196,L297197,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,"Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?"
203197,L297196,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze."
203198,L297189,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,"Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?"
203199,L297188,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,Major.
203200,L297187,u5987,m397,FRANCIS,Awesome sleet and rain.
203201,L296874,u5992,m397,JIM,"Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?"
203202,L296873,u5991,m397,JANEY,"Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born."
203203,L296872,u5992,m397,JIM,"You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?"
203204,L296871,u5991,m397,JANEY,Just be careful.
203205,L296870,u5992,m397,JIM,"Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed."
203206,L296869,u5991,m397,JANEY,"Jesus, Jim!"
203207,L296932,u5991,m397,JANEY,Play with the whip.
203208,L296931,u5998,m397,SANDY,No!
203209,L296930,u5991,m397,JANEY,"It's not packed with explosives, is it?"
203210,L296929,u5998,m397,SANDY,"You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico."
203211,L296928,u5991,m397,JANEY,Would it matter?  And what's that?
203212,L296927,u5998,m397,SANDY,You going to tell dad?
203213,L296926,u5991,m397,JANEY,Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
203214,L297259,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,"Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted."
203215,L297258,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?"
203216,L297257,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,I do.
203217,L297254,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,"And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --"
203218,L297253,u5996,m397,PAUL,You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
203219,L297252,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,"And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special."
203220,L297251,u5996,m397,PAUL,"It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --"
203221,L297250,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,My what?
203222,L297249,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off."
203223,L297248,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,Yeah but you don't even know me really.
203224,L297247,u5996,m397,PAUL,"You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --"
203225,L297246,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,Yeah.
203226,L297237,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,Thanks for the advice dad.
203227,L297236,u5996,m397,PAUL,Maybe you should have just a half.
203228,L297231,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,What is it?
203229,L297230,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Well, uh, I don't, it's really --"
203230,L297194,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Hey, it's a sellable skill."
203231,L297193,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,Frankie opens them with his teeth.
203232,L296623,u5996,m397,PAUL,The Idiot.
203233,L296622,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,"Great, thanks for the tip."
203234,L296621,u5996,m397,PAUL,"If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot."
203235,L296620,u5993,m397,LIBBETS,The Idiot?
203236,L296619,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?"
203237,L296634,u5996,m397,PAUL,Good thinking Marge.
203238,L296633,u5994,m397,MARGE,"Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?"
203239,L296632,u5996,m397,PAUL,You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
203240,L296631,u5994,m397,MARGE,They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
203241,L296630,u5996,m397,PAUL,How do you know this shit?
203242,L296629,u5994,m397,MARGE,My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
203243,L296628,u5996,m397,PAUL,Truly? Do speak.
203244,L296627,u5994,m397,MARGE,"That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act."
203245,L296626,u5996,m397,PAUL,It's beyond mere physical attraction.
203246,L296625,u5994,m397,MARGE,"Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets."
203247,L296624,u5996,m397,PAUL,I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
203248,L297213,u5995,m397,MIKEY,"Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean."
203249,L297212,u5998,m397,SANDY,It's freezing.
203250,L297211,u5995,m397,MIKEY,Out.
203251,L297210,u5998,m397,SANDY,Where you going?
203252,L296858,u5995,m397,MIKEY,I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
203253,L296857,u5998,m397,SANDY,Why are you so good at math but not in English?
203254,L296856,u5995,m397,MIKEY,"Sure, anything but this English."
203255,L296855,u5998,m397,SANDY,Geometry?
203256,L296854,u5995,m397,MIKEY,Yeah?
203257,L296853,u5998,m397,SANDY,Mikey?
203258,L296718,u5995,m397,MIKEY,I don't have a girlfriend.
203259,L296717,u5998,m397,SANDY,No one.
203260,L296716,u5995,m397,MIKEY,Who said so?
203261,L296715,u5998,m397,SANDY,Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
203262,L297206,u5999,m397,WENDY,Yeah.
203263,L297205,u5995,m397,MIKEY,"I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to."
203264,L297204,u5999,m397,WENDY,Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
203265,L297203,u5995,m397,MIKEY,You get in trouble?
203266,L297202,u5999,m397,WENDY,Yeah. Yours?
203267,L297201,u5995,m397,MIKEY,You're parents at that party?
203268,L297056,u5995,m397,MIKEY,4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
203269,L297055,u5999,m397,WENDY,Huh?
203270,L297054,u5995,m397,MIKEY,When worlds collide.
203271,L297052,u5995,m397,MIKEY,Wendy!
203272,L297051,u5999,m397,WENDY,Wow!
203273,L297049,u5995,m397,MIKEY,You like him? He worships you.
203274,L297048,u5999,m397,WENDY,I don't know.
203275,L297047,u5995,m397,MIKEY,Why did you -- with Sandy?
203276,L297046,u5999,m397,WENDY,I don't know.
203277,L297045,u5995,m397,MIKEY,"Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to..."
203278,L297044,u5995,m397,MIKEY,There's a TV in the basement.
203279,L297043,u5999,m397,WENDY,Maybe we can just watch some TV.
203280,L297042,u5995,m397,MIKEY,"See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?"
203281,L296976,u5995,m397,MIKEY,I dunno. I --
203282,L296975,u5999,m397,WENDY,You have to follow me?
203283,L296952,u5999,m397,WENDY,Then why'd you come after me?
203284,L296951,u5995,m397,MIKEY,I don't ever want to see you.
203285,L296810,u5995,m397,MIKEY,Tell Sandy? What?
203286,L296809,u5999,m397,WENDY,Did you tell Sandy?
203287,L296808,u5995,m397,MIKEY,I'm chewing.
203288,L296807,u5999,m397,WENDY,Sure.  Twinkie?
203289,L296806,u5995,m397,MIKEY,Want some gum?
203290,L297273,u5999,m397,WENDY,I have plans.
203291,L297272,u5996,m397,PAUL,What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
203292,L297271,u5999,m397,WENDY,Right.
203293,L297270,u5996,m397,PAUL,Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
203294,L297269,u5999,m397,WENDY,And?
203295,L297268,u5996,m397,PAUL,"I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --"
203296,L297267,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?"
203297,L297266,u5996,m397,PAUL,What time is it?
203298,L297265,u5999,m397,WENDY,Is this Charles?
203299,L297264,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Charles, what time is it?"
203300,L297263,u5999,m397,WENDY,Hood residence.
203301,L297016,u5999,m397,WENDY,Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
203302,L297015,u5996,m397,PAUL,Her name's Libbets.
203303,L297014,u5999,m397,WENDY,With who?
203304,L297013,u5996,m397,PAUL,It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
203305,L297012,u5999,m397,WENDY,Can I come?
203306,L297011,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night."
203307,L297010,u5999,m397,WENDY,Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
203308,L297009,u5996,m397,PAUL,May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
203309,L297008,u5999,m397,WENDY,Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
203310,L297007,u5996,m397,PAUL,I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
203311,L297006,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much."
203312,L297005,u5996,m397,PAUL,How are the parental units functioning these days?
203313,L297004,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Greetings, Charles."
203314,L297003,u5996,m397,PAUL,"Hello, Charles."
203315,L296669,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot."
203316,L296668,u5996,m397,PAUL,Watching what?
203317,L296667,u5999,m397,WENDY,I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
203318,L296666,u5996,m397,PAUL,Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
203319,L296665,u5999,m397,WENDY,Charles.
203320,L297369,u5999,m397,WENDY,"I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down."
203321,L297368,u5998,m397,SANDY,I don't know. How do I know?
203322,L297367,u5999,m397,WENDY,That's nice. Are you drunk?
203323,L297366,u5998,m397,SANDY,I love you.
203324,L297364,u5999,m397,WENDY,"That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream."
203325,L297363,u5998,m397,SANDY,Huh?
203326,L297362,u5999,m397,WENDY,Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
203327,L297359,u5998,m397,SANDY,Okay.
203328,L297358,u5999,m397,WENDY,One more shot?
203329,L297357,u5998,m397,SANDY,It feels warm.
203330,L297355,u5999,m397,WENDY,You never tasted the stuff?
203331,L297354,u5998,m397,SANDY,Vodka?
203332,L297353,u5999,m397,WENDY,Want a drink?
203333,L297351,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff."
203334,L297350,u5998,m397,SANDY,We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
203335,L297348,u5999,m397,WENDY,They left it in the jungle.
203336,L297347,u5998,m397,SANDY,Communist Viet Cong.
203337,L297346,u5999,m397,WENDY,Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
203338,L297345,u5999,m397,WENDY,He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
203339,L297344,u5998,m397,SANDY,If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
203340,L297343,u5999,m397,WENDY,He's dead.
203341,L297328,u5999,m397,WENDY,No.
203342,L297327,u5998,m397,SANDY,Are you his girlfriend?
203343,L297326,u5999,m397,WENDY,Yeah.
203344,L297325,u5998,m397,SANDY,Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
203345,L297324,u5999,m397,WENDY,Just thought I'd stop by.
203346,L297323,u5998,m397,SANDY,What are you doing?
203347,L297322,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Sandy, you scared the shit out of me."
203348,L296946,u5998,m397,SANDY,Yeah.
203349,L296945,u5999,m397,WENDY,I have to go to the bathroom.
203350,L296944,u5998,m397,SANDY,"They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up."
203351,L296943,u5999,m397,WENDY,The ones you built?
203352,L296942,u5998,m397,SANDY,All my model planes.
203353,L296941,u5999,m397,WENDY,"Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d."
203354,L296940,u5998,m397,SANDY,"Well, you can..."
203355,L296804,u5999,m397,WENDY,Yeah? See ya.
203356,L296803,u5998,m397,SANDY,Mikey was looking for you.
203357,L296802,u5999,m397,WENDY,Hey Sandy.
203358,L296801,u5998,m397,SANDY,Hey Wendy.
203359,L305318,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Sure.
203360,L305317,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
203361,L305316,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Good.
203362,L305315,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
203363,L305314,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Didn't want to miss anything.
203364,L304702,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,"That's all, for now."
203365,L304701,u6001,m398,ELLIE,"Yes, sir."
203366,L305312,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,Too bad...
203367,L305311,u6009,m398,WILL,I have to get back.
203368,L304907,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,It's only gonna make you crazy.
203369,L304906,u6009,m398,WILL,I had him!
203370,L304905,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,"Will, you can't blame yourself."
203371,L304899,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
203372,L304898,u6009,m398,WILL,And then I lost him.  In the fog.
203373,L304718,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
203374,L304717,u6009,m398,WILL,That's I.A.'s pit bull.
203375,L304711,u6009,m398,WILL,"Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft."
203376,L304710,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,What's the D.A. got them on?
203377,L304709,u6009,m398,WILL,So far.
203378,L304705,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
203379,L304704,u6009,m398,WILL,Nice kid.
203380,L304695,u6000,m398,CHIEF NYBACK,"What's that, then?"
203381,L304694,u6009,m398,WILL,Just after Leland Street.
203382,L305359,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
203383,L305358,u6009,m398,WILL,What about your shoulder?
203384,L305353,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Why?
203385,L305352,u6009,m398,WILL,No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
203386,L305348,u6009,m398,WILL,Byrd's dead.
203387,L305347,u6001,m398,ELLIE,I know.
203388,L305346,u6009,m398,WILL,Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
203389,L305277,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Worth pursuing?
203390,L305276,u6009,m398,WILL,It's legitimate.
203391,L305149,u6001,m398,ELLIE,"Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?"
203392,L305148,u6009,m398,WILL,Not really.
203393,L305147,u6001,m398,ELLIE,About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
203394,L305146,u6009,m398,WILL,Duggar called him?
203395,L305039,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Five feet?  Seven feet?
203396,L305038,u6009,m398,WILL,I don't remember.
203397,L305037,u6001,m398,ELLIE,How much closer would you say you were?
203398,L305036,u6009,m398,WILL,Then change it.
203399,L305035,u6001,m398,ELLIE,"But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog."
203400,L305003,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Okay.
203401,L305002,u6009,m398,WILL,"I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records."
203402,L304999,u6001,m398,ELLIE,That must have been awful for you.
203403,L304998,u6009,m398,WILL,It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
203404,L304997,u6001,m398,ELLIE,"Oh, I shouldn't have..."
203405,L304995,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Twelve years younger.
203406,L304994,u6009,m398,WILL,She your only sibling?
203407,L304992,u6001,m398,ELLIE,The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
203408,L304991,u6009,m398,WILL,Who's playing?
203409,L304990,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
203410,L304989,u6009,m398,WILL,I could say the same thing about you.
203411,L304871,u6009,m398,WILL,"Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions."
203412,L304870,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Yeah.  All over.
203413,L304869,u6009,m398,WILL,"This murder was in the papers, right?"
203414,L304841,u6009,m398,WILL,Good.  He's up next.
203415,L304840,u6001,m398,ELLIE,The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
203416,L304839,u6009,m398,WILL,Who's that?
203417,L304836,u6001,m398,ELLIE,But there wasn't any...
203418,L304835,u6009,m398,WILL,Do it again.
203419,L304834,u6001,m398,ELLIE,We already did.
203420,L304833,u6009,m398,WILL,"I want you to check this out, Ellie."
203421,L304790,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
203422,L304789,u6009,m398,WILL,Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
203423,L304785,u6009,m398,WILL,It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
203424,L304784,u6001,m398,ELLIE,But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
203425,L304783,u6009,m398,WILL,Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
203426,L304727,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Don't worry about him...
203427,L304726,u6009,m398,WILL,Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
203428,L304687,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Actually...
203429,L304686,u6009,m398,WILL,"You did your homework, Officer."
203430,L304682,u6001,m398,ELLIE,Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
203431,L304681,u6009,m398,WILL,My partner...
203432,L304956,u6002,m398,FARRELL,"We'll get the other one, though."
203433,L304955,u6009,m398,WILL,Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
203434,L304954,u6002,m398,FARRELL,"Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through."
203435,L304947,u6009,m398,WILL,Anything.  It's important.
203436,L304946,u6002,m398,FARRELL,What I saw?
203437,L304945,u6009,m398,WILL,"That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell."
203438,L304944,u6002,m398,FARRELL,"We just gotta catch the bastard, right?"
203439,L304943,u6009,m398,WILL,He would have liked that.
203440,L304942,u6002,m398,FARRELL,I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
203441,L304941,u6009,m398,WILL,Thanks.
203442,L304890,u6009,m398,WILL,Where is he?
203443,L304889,u6002,m398,FARRELL,Sorry about...
203444,L305105,u6003,m398,FRED,This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
203445,L305104,u6009,m398,WILL,So?
203446,L305103,u6003,m398,FRED,Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
203447,L305102,u6009,m398,WILL,That's right.
203448,L305101,u6003,m398,FRED,One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
203449,L305100,u6009,m398,WILL,No.
203450,L305099,u6003,m398,FRED,And something else that might interest you.
203451,L305098,u6009,m398,WILL,Good.
203452,L305097,u6003,m398,FRED,I beeped you over two hours ago.
203453,L305096,u6009,m398,WILL,What?
203454,L305095,u6003,m398,FRED,Forget your pager?
203455,L305018,u6009,m398,WILL,First I need a copy of the key.
203456,L305017,u6003,m398,FRED,I'll call him now.
203457,L304935,u6009,m398,WILL,I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
203458,L304934,u6003,m398,FRED,Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
203459,L304878,u6009,m398,WILL,I told her to come.
203460,L304877,u6003,m398,FRED,What are you doing here?
203461,L304865,u6009,m398,WILL,No.
203462,L304864,u6003,m398,FRED,I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
203463,L304859,u6003,m398,FRED,Has her books in it.
203464,L304858,u6009,m398,WILL,We're sure it's hers?
203465,L304796,u6003,m398,FRED,"Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything."
203466,L304795,u6009,m398,WILL,Who was the last one to see her alive?
203467,L304794,u6003,m398,FRED,Around twelve-thirty.
203468,L304793,u6009,m398,WILL,What time was that?
203469,L304792,u6003,m398,FRED,She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
203470,L304739,u6003,m398,FRED,"Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here."
203471,L304738,u6009,m398,WILL,"No fibers, skin flakes, hairs..."
203472,L304737,u6003,m398,FRED,No.
203473,L305221,u6008,m398,WALTER,"She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret."
203474,L305220,u6003,m398,FRED,Are you sure about that?
203475,L305215,u6008,m398,WALTER,That's right.
203476,L305214,u6003,m398,FRED,Randy Stetz?
203477,L305213,u6008,m398,WALTER,That boyfriend.  Randy.
203478,L305212,u6003,m398,FRED,How do you mean?
203479,L305211,u6008,m398,WALTER,She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
203480,L305193,u6008,m398,WALTER,Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
203481,L305192,u6003,m398,FRED,Did she?
203482,L305191,u6008,m398,WALTER,She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
203483,L305190,u6003,m398,FRED,What happened at that signing?
203484,L305189,u6008,m398,WALTER,That's right.
203485,L305188,u6003,m398,FRED,Where you signed this?
203486,L304851,u6009,m398,WILL,You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
203487,L304850,u6004,m398,HAP,"You don't have to be involved, Will."
203488,L304849,u6009,m398,WILL,"Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing..."
203489,L304848,u6004,m398,HAP,I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
203490,L304847,u6009,m398,WILL,"Don't do this, Hap..."
203491,L304846,u6004,m398,HAP,"I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids..."
203492,L304845,u6004,m398,HAP,Will?
203493,L304844,u6009,m398,WILL,Looks like the natives are restless.
203494,L304800,u6004,m398,HAP,What are we thinking?
203495,L304799,u6009,m398,WILL,Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
203496,L304774,u6009,m398,WILL,"Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions."
203497,L304773,u6004,m398,HAP,Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
203498,L304772,u6009,m398,WILL,No way.
203499,L304771,u6004,m398,HAP,Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
203500,L304770,u6009,m398,WILL,One word to I.A. and he walks.
203501,L304769,u6004,m398,HAP,You know I remember that.
203502,L304768,u6009,m398,WILL,Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
203503,L304766,u6009,m398,WILL,We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
203504,L304765,u6004,m398,HAP,"Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard."
203505,L304764,u6009,m398,WILL,He's just rattling your cage.
203506,L304763,u6004,m398,HAP,But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
203507,L304762,u6009,m398,WILL,He's asking everybody questions.
203508,L304761,u6004,m398,HAP,"Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions..."
203509,L304760,u6009,m398,WILL,That's right.

203511,L304758,u6009,m398,WILL,You know my plan of action.
203512,L304757,u6004,m398,HAP,"When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now."
203513,L304756,u6009,m398,WILL,We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
203514,L304755,u6004,m398,HAP,You know what about.
203515,L304754,u6009,m398,WILL,What do you want to talk about?
203516,L304741,u6004,m398,HAP,Even the best make mistakes.
203517,L304740,u6009,m398,WILL,He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
203518,L304715,u6004,m398,HAP,"I.A.'s calling themselves the ""Corruption Task Force.""  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or ""oversights"" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night."
203519,L304714,u6009,m398,WILL,They're all over everybody.
203520,L304697,u6009,m398,WILL,Seven years.
203521,L304696,u6004,m398,HAP,Eight years.
203522,L305178,u6009,m398,WILL,We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
203523,L305177,u6005,m398,RACHEL,What if someone finds out?
203524,L305176,u6009,m398,WILL,There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
203525,L305175,u6005,m398,RACHEL,Will.
203526,L305172,u6009,m398,WILL,"Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment."
203527,L305171,u6005,m398,RACHEL,One of your cases?
203528,L305162,u6005,m398,RACHEL,There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
203529,L305161,u6009,m398,WILL,What is it?
203530,L305160,u6005,m398,RACHEL,Will...I...
203531,L304986,u6009,m398,WILL,What did he look like?
203532,L304985,u6005,m398,RACHEL,That's not what he thinks.
203533,L304984,u6009,m398,WILL,I'm not expecting anyone.
203534,L304983,u6005,m398,RACHEL,No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
203535,L304982,u6009,m398,WILL,Fred Duggar?
203536,L304981,u6009,m398,WILL,Habit.
203537,L304980,u6005,m398,RACHEL,I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
203538,L304749,u6009,m398,WILL,I'm always all business.
203539,L304748,u6005,m398,RACHEL,Your friend's all business.
203540,L305050,u6009,m398,WILL,"Good to see you, too, Randy."
203541,L305049,u6006,m398,RANDY,Thought I smelled something.
203542,L304830,u6006,m398,RANDY,She didn't tell me.
203543,L304829,u6009,m398,WILL,You don't know.
203544,L304828,u6006,m398,RANDY,I don't know.
203545,L304826,u6006,m398,RANDY,"Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions..."
203546,L304825,u6009,m398,WILL,Ran like hell to go to him...
203547,L304824,u6006,m398,RANDY,How should I know?...
203548,L304823,u6009,m398,WILL,After that she left the party to go to him.
203549,L304822,u6006,m398,RANDY,I told you I don't remember.
203550,L304821,u6009,m398,WILL,The other guy?
203551,L304820,u6006,m398,RANDY,Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
203552,L304819,u6009,m398,WILL,What kind of stuff?
203553,L304818,u6006,m398,RANDY,Stuff.
203554,L304817,u6009,m398,WILL,"Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?"
203555,L304816,u6006,m398,RANDY,I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
203556,L304815,u6009,m398,WILL,But she was seeing someone else on the side.
203557,L304814,u6006,m398,RANDY,She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
203558,L304813,u6009,m398,WILL,You heard me that time.
203559,L304812,u6006,m398,RANDY,Huh?
203560,L304811,u6009,m398,WILL,"""She was nice.""  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?"
203561,L304809,u6009,m398,WILL,Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
203562,L304808,u6006,m398,RANDY,Huh?
203563,L304807,u6009,m398,WILL,Did you love her?
203564,L305091,u6007,m398,TANYA,Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
203565,L305090,u6009,m398,WILL,What was it?
203566,L305089,u6007,m398,TANYA,She used some stupid code name.
203567,L305088,u6009,m398,WILL,Who?
203568,L305087,u6007,m398,TANYA,My arm!
203569,L305086,u6009,m398,WILL,Who?
203570,L305085,u6007,m398,TANYA,She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
203571,L305084,u6009,m398,WILL,What was?
203572,L305083,u6007,m398,TANYA,It was like some big fucking secret!
203573,L305082,u6009,m398,WILL,But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
203574,L305081,u6007,m398,TANYA,She wouldn't tell me!
203575,L305080,u6009,m398,WILL,You don't know.
203576,L305079,u6007,m398,TANYA,I don't know.
203577,L305078,u6009,m398,WILL,Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
203578,L305077,u6007,m398,TANYA,No...
203579,L305076,u6009,m398,WILL,Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
203580,L305075,u6007,m398,TANYA,That's what I said.
203581,L305074,u6009,m398,WILL,You and Kay were like sisters?
203582,L305071,u6009,m398,WILL,Thought you wanted something fun...
203583,L305070,u6007,m398,TANYA,Hey...
203584,L305068,u6007,m398,TANYA,Long as it's fun.
203585,L305067,u6009,m398,WILL,You want me to take you somewhere?
203586,L305063,u6009,m398,WILL,Must be tough for you.  What happened.
203587,L305062,u6007,m398,TANYA,We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
203588,L305061,u6009,m398,WILL,That's a long time.
203589,L305060,u6007,m398,TANYA,Since grade school.
203590,L305059,u6009,m398,WILL,Best friend?
203591,L305058,u6007,m398,TANYA,I was her best friend.
203592,L305056,u6007,m398,TANYA,What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
203593,L305055,u6009,m398,WILL,You're not missing much.
203594,L305054,u6007,m398,TANYA,I never met anyone from Seattle before.
203595,L305338,u6009,m398,WILL,"Drop the gun, Walter."
203596,L305337,u6008,m398,WALTER,Wild card.
203597,L305330,u6009,m398,WILL,Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
203598,L305329,u6008,m398,WALTER,You're not following procedure.
203599,L305328,u6009,m398,WILL,No back-up.
203600,L305327,u6008,m398,WALTER,Where's your back-up?
203601,L305304,u6008,m398,WALTER,If you want it to be...
203602,L305303,u6009,m398,WILL,"This an accident, Walter?"
203603,L305302,u6008,m398,WALTER,Yes.  Like that.
203604,L305300,u6008,m398,WALTER,It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
203605,L305299,u6009,m398,WILL,"Couldn't get it up, Walter?"
203606,L305298,u6008,m398,WALTER,"I didn't want to kill her, Will."
203607,L305297,u6009,m398,WILL,Don't you pull that shit with me.
203608,L305296,u6008,m398,WALTER,Then so was mine...
203609,L305295,u6009,m398,WILL,I told you that was an accident!
203610,L305294,u6008,m398,WALTER,"Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me."
203611,L305293,u6009,m398,WILL,What the hell do you know?
203612,L305290,u6008,m398,WALTER,But we work so well together...
203613,L305289,u6009,m398,WILL,There's nothing more to talk about.
203614,L305288,u6008,m398,WALTER,I thought maybe we could talk some more.
203615,L305287,u6009,m398,WILL,Congratulations.
203616,L305286,u6008,m398,WALTER,Told you I could write an ending.
203617,L305285,u6009,m398,WILL,Randy Stetz is in jail.
203618,L305217,u6008,m398,WALTER,"He.  Well, he..."
203619,L305216,u6009,m398,WILL,What about him?
203620,L305209,u6008,m398,WALTER,I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
203621,L305208,u6009,m398,WILL,Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
203622,L305207,u6008,m398,WALTER,Yes.
203623,L305206,u6009,m398,WILL,Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
203624,L305205,u6008,m398,WALTER,Yes.
203625,L305204,u6009,m398,WILL,You gave her gifts.
203626,L305203,u6008,m398,WALTER,I was a mentor to her.
203627,L305202,u6009,m398,WILL,But you wanted to.
203628,L305201,u6008,m398,WALTER,No.
203629,L305200,u6009,m398,WILL,Did you have sex with her?
203630,L305199,u6008,m398,WALTER,I suppose.
203631,L305198,u6009,m398,WILL,But she was an attractive girl.
203632,L305197,u6008,m398,WALTER,She was only seventeen.
203633,L305134,u6009,m398,WILL,Yes down at the station.
203634,L305133,u6008,m398,WALTER,Down at the station?
203635,L305132,u6009,m398,WILL,You're going to be brought in for questioning.
203636,L305131,u6008,m398,WALTER,Thought you might find that.
203637,L305130,u6009,m398,WILL,Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
203638,L305129,u6008,m398,WALTER,Oh?
203639,L305128,u6009,m398,WILL,I said you're going to get a phone call.
203640,L305127,u6008,m398,WALTER,I'm sorry?
203641,L305122,u6009,m398,WILL,The phone call.  The knapsack.
203642,L305121,u6008,m398,WALTER,No game.
203643,L306113,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"We are a pair, and that's what counts."
203644,L306112,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?"
203645,L306111,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Your melancholy eyes...
203646,L306110,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes."
203647,L306109,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You were their leader. They trusted you.
203648,L306108,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn."
203649,L306107,u6013,m399,LOUIS,And yet you knew what I would o.
203650,L306106,u6010,m399,ARMAND,No.
203651,L306105,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"You didn't even warm them, did you?"
203652,L306103,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again."
203653,L306102,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"Louis, I swear I did not."
203654,L306101,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
203655,L306100,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You let them do it.
203656,L306099,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me."
203657,L306098,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
203658,L306097,u6010,m399,ARMAND,I couldn't prevent it.
203659,L306094,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -"
203660,L306093,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
203661,L306092,u6010,m399,ARMAND,I can't save her.
203662,L306091,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Not without Claudia. Where is she?
203663,L306090,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Follow me - that way - through my cell -
203664,L306089,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Where is she? Where's Claudia?
203665,L306032,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
203666,L306031,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Lestat! You knew Lestat!
203667,L306030,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --"
203668,L306029,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Yes... My God...
203669,L306028,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Are these not the answers you came for?
203670,L306027,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart."
203671,L306026,u6013,m399,LOUIS,And the vampires of the Theatre?
203672,L306022,u6010,m399,ARMAND,How he must have loved you.
203673,L306021,u6013,m399,LOUIS,That's what the one who made me said.
203674,L306020,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much."
203675,L306019,u6013,m399,LOUIS,We can do that?
203676,L306018,u6010,m399,ARMAND,But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
203677,L306017,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You said there were none.
203678,L306016,u6010,m399,ARMAND,So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
203679,L306015,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Then I leave too.
203680,L306014,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away."
203681,L306013,u6013,m399,LOUIS,We want no quarrel with him.
203682,L306012,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
203683,L306011,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Then blame the one who made her...
203684,L306010,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own."
203685,L306009,u6013,m399,LOUIS,But why?
203686,L306008,u6010,m399,ARMAND,She is.
203687,L306007,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
203688,L306006,u6010,m399,ARMAND,If you say so. You are innocent.
203689,L306005,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"No, my beloved, my child."
203690,L306004,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Your lover.
203691,L306003,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
203692,L306002,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Listen to me.
203693,L306001,u6010,m399,ARMAND,I was waiting for you...
203694,L305970,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Knew? You mean he is...
203695,L305969,u6013,m399,LOUIS,He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
203696,L305968,u6010,m399,ARMAND,The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
203697,L305967,u6010,m399,ARMAND,You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
203698,L305966,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing."
203699,L305965,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world."
203700,L305964,u6013,m399,LOUIS,And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
203701,L305963,u6010,m399,ARMAND,I have not spoken to him...
203702,L305962,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Then God does not exist...
203703,L305961,u6010,m399,ARMAND,And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
203704,L305960,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Perhaps...
203705,L305959,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Then there is nothing.
203706,L305958,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?"
203707,L305957,u6010,m399,ARMAND,No.
203708,L305956,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You mean we are not children of Satan?
203709,L305955,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"That is a picture, nothing more."
203710,L305954,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil..."
203711,L305953,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Surely you know the one who made you...
203712,L305952,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Who made us what we are?
203713,L305951,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Nothing if not vampires...
203714,L305950,u6013,m399,LOUIS,What are we?
203715,L305949,u6010,m399,ARMAND,Ah! You have questions?
203716,L305948,u6013,m399,LOUIS,So you have the answers...
203717,L305947,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"If there were a leader, I would be the one."
203718,L305946,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Are you the leader of tis group?
203719,L305945,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away."
203720,L305944,u6010,m399,ARMAND,But how did you come into existence?
203721,L305943,u6013,m399,LOUIS,We had feared we were the only ones...
203722,L305942,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe..."
203723,L305940,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed."
203724,L305939,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Your lips, they didn't move."
203725,L305938,u6010,m399,ARMAND,"Yes, and very beautiful."
203726,L305937,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Monstrous.
203727,L305804,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
203728,L305803,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Louis, put me in my coffin..."
203729,L305802,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Don't Louis --
203730,L305800,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm."
203731,L305799,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Laudanum!
203732,L305798,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,No. Laudanum.
203733,L305797,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
203734,L305796,u6012,m399,LESTAT,We forgive each other then?
203735,L305795,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
203736,L305794,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?"
203737,L305791,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
203738,L305790,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you."
203739,L305789,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Stop pestering me then!
203740,L305788,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were."
203741,L305787,u6012,m399,LESTAT,What plans?
203742,L305786,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
203743,L305785,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Not you my dear.
203744,L305784,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us."
203745,L305783,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
203746,L305782,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Is that supposed to frighten me?
203747,L305781,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
203748,L305780,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Does it?
203749,L305779,u6012,m399,LESTAT,What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
203750,L305734,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
203751,L305733,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
203752,L305731,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
203753,L305730,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Stop her Louis!
203754,L305729,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"You made us what we are, didn't you?"
203755,L305727,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
203756,L305726,u6012,m399,LESTAT,It will grow back again!
203757,L305725,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,And if I cut my hair again?
203758,L305724,u6012,m399,LESTAT,What you are? You would be something other than you are?
203759,L305723,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
203760,L305718,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
203761,L305717,u6012,m399,LESTAT,But you're the fairest by far.
203762,L305716,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,I have. Or there would be twice as many.
203763,L305715,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
203764,L305714,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Is this my birthday?
203765,L305713,u6012,m399,LESTAT,I didn't realise.
203766,L305712,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
203767,L305711,u6012,m399,LESTAT,What night? What do you mean?
203768,L305710,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Why always on this night?
203769,L305665,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy."
203770,L305664,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,I'm not your daughter.
203771,L305658,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child."
203772,L305657,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,I want some more.
203773,L305652,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again."
203774,L305651,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,More.
203775,L306066,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human."
203776,L306065,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,What do you mean?
203777,L306064,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even."
203778,L306063,u6013,m399,LOUIS,It's only mortal death.
203779,L306062,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,But if she dies...
203780,L306061,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember."
203781,L306049,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?"
203782,L306048,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Yes...
203783,L306047,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis..."
203784,L306045,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
203785,L306044,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!"
203786,L306043,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
203787,L306042,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?"
203788,L306000,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,You really believe that?
203789,L305999,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"He can protect us, Claudia."
203790,L305997,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Let him go, he said. Let him go."
203791,L305996,u6013,m399,LOUIS,So you felt it too!
203792,L305995,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
203793,L305994,u6013,m399,LOUIS,That's not so.
203794,L305993,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
203795,L305992,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Never.
203796,L305991,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
203797,L305990,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Love?
203798,L305989,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you."
203799,L305988,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me."
203800,L305987,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Do you think I would let them harm you?
203801,L305986,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!"
203802,L305985,u6013,m399,LOUIS,What danger?
203803,L305984,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!"
203804,L305933,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Be still!
203805,L305932,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
203806,L305918,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Yes, and very beautiful."
203807,L305917,u6013,m399,LOUIS,This is monstrous!
203808,L305911,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,And no one knows but us...
203809,L305910,u6013,m399,LOUIS,This is no performance.
203810,L305906,u6013,m399,LOUIS,No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
203811,L305905,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,She's no vampire.
203812,L305904,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,How devilishly clever.
203813,L305903,u6013,m399,LOUIS,They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
203814,L305901,u6013,m399,LOUIS,They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
203815,L305900,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink."
203816,L305899,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
203817,L305898,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
203818,L305884,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Come, Claudia..."
203819,L305883,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?"
203820,L305882,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You know her?
203821,L305881,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --"
203822,L305880,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
203823,L305878,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You are more beautiful than any of them.
203824,L305877,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever."
203825,L305876,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Claudia, you torture yourself."
203826,L305875,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Or her, or her - or any of them?"
203827,L305872,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"But how will I ever know, Louis?"
203828,L305871,u6013,m399,LOUIS,It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
203829,L305870,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,You don't remember? Or you never knew.
203830,L305869,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?"
203831,L305868,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Yes.
203832,L305867,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?"
203833,L305865,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Yes...
203834,L305864,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
203835,L305863,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Still my beautiful child.
203836,L305862,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,How do I look?
203837,L305844,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Not yet.
203838,L305843,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,The ship is sailing wihout us!
203839,L305840,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,It is! Take the back stairwell -
203840,L305839,u6013,m399,LOUIS,It can't be -
203841,L305835,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -"
203842,L305834,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,What was that?
203843,L305831,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
203844,L305830,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -"
203845,L305829,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
203846,L305828,u6013,m399,LOUIS,And you never cried -
203847,L305827,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
203848,L305825,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I can't. Go away from me.
203849,L305824,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Louis, look at me."
203850,L305823,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free."
203851,L305822,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is."
203852,L305821,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die."
203853,L305819,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge."
203854,L305818,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means."
203855,L305817,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,The swamp...
203856,L305816,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Don't mock, Claudia..."
203857,L305815,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?"
203858,L305813,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead."
203859,L305812,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"He's dead, Claudia, dead."
203860,L305810,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Don't mock me, Louis. Help me."
203861,L305809,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Lestat. Oh, God forgive us."
203862,L305776,u6013,m399,LOUIS,He'll never let us go.
203863,L305775,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him."
203864,L305747,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I took your life. He gave you another one.
203865,L305746,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,You both did it?
203866,L305745,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter."
203867,L305744,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,You... fed on me?
203868,L305738,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up."
203869,L305737,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
203870,L305736,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
203871,L305735,u6013,m399,LOUIS,We're immortal. You've always known that.
203872,L305721,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Why not?
203873,L305720,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Claudia - don't -
203874,L305719,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,You want me to be a doll forever?
203875,L305700,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Sit still. It's not finished -
203876,L305699,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Claudia! You did that?
203877,L305698,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book."
203878,L305697,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,Why does he call you that?
203879,L305696,u6013,m399,LOUIS,He jests.
203880,L305695,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death."
203881,L305694,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
203882,L305693,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,"But you never let me see you kill, Louis."
203883,L305692,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,The way I learn everything. By watching you.
203884,L305691,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"How did you learn to write, Claudia?"
203885,L305650,u6013,m399,LOUIS,What have you done?
203886,L305649,u6011,m399,CLAUDIA,I want more.
203887,L306145,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You have it...
203888,L306144,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis."
203889,L306143,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I tried...
203890,L306142,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you."
203891,L306141,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Yes. I remember...
203892,L306140,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat..."
203893,L306139,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I have to go now Lestat...
203894,L306138,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat."
203895,L306137,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you..."
203896,L306136,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
203897,L306135,u6013,m399,LOUIS,And they frighten you?
203898,L306134,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!"
203899,L306133,u6013,m399,LOUIS,It's only a siren...
203900,L306132,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?"
203901,L306131,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm."
203902,L306130,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
203903,L306129,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
203904,L306128,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"That's all past, Lestat."
203905,L306127,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me..."
203906,L306126,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Don't try to speak... it's alright...
203907,L306125,u6012,m399,LESTAT,I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
203908,L306096,u6013,m399,LOUIS,CLAUDIA!!!
203909,L306095,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
203910,L306077,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Are you mad????
203911,L306076,u6012,m399,LESTAT,No... You come back to me Louis...
203912,L305806,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---"
203913,L305805,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
203914,L305677,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what..."
203915,L305676,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie..."
203916,L305663,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
203917,L305662,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
203918,L305661,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
203919,L305656,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops."
203920,L305655,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
203921,L305646,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Lestat, what do you mean?"
203922,L305645,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well."
203923,L305644,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive."
203924,L305643,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I didn't want to kill her.
203925,L305642,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -"
203926,L305641,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Lestat!
203927,L305640,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine..."
203928,L305639,u6013,m399,LOUIS,What are you saying?
203929,L305638,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"She's here, your wounded one."
203930,L305637,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child."
203931,L305636,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
203932,L305635,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves."
203933,L305634,u6012,m399,LESTAT,That and more.
203934,L305633,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
203935,L305632,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
203936,L305631,u6013,m399,LOUIS,No...
203937,L305630,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
203938,L305617,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you."
203939,L305616,u6013,m399,LOUIS,My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
203940,L305615,u6012,m399,LESTAT,THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
203941,L305614,u6013,m399,LOUIS,NO!!!
203942,L305613,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Unless I make her one of us...
203943,L305610,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You finish her - if you feel so much -
203944,L305609,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Lestat - finish this -
203945,L305606,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!"
203946,L305605,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Why do you do this Lestat?
203947,L305601,u6012,m399,LESTAT,I know. Let her alone.
203948,L305600,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"The girl, Lestat -"
203949,L305599,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment."
203950,L305598,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Lestat, she's alive!!!!"
203951,L305597,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God."
203952,L305596,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I don't pretend to know.
203953,L305595,u6012,m399,LESTAT,What do you imagine you are Louis?
203954,L305594,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
203955,L305593,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?"
203956,L305578,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?"
203957,L305577,u6013,m399,LOUIS,We belong in hell.
203958,L305576,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?"
203959,L305575,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Where are we?
203960,L305574,u6013,m399,LOUIS,What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
203961,L305573,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"You fool, what have you done?"
203962,L305561,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
203963,L305560,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect."
203964,L305559,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
203965,L305558,u6013,m399,LOUIS,They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
203966,L305556,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we..."
203967,L305555,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?"
203968,L305554,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
203969,L305553,u6012,m399,LESTAT,As did the one who made me.
203970,L305552,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Paris? You came from Paris?
203971,L305551,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
203972,L305544,u6012,m399,LESTAT,I don't know any hell -
203973,L305543,u6013,m399,LOUIS,What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
203974,L305535,u6012,m399,LESTAT,The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
203975,L305534,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I can't.
203976,L305533,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Read her thoughts.
203977,L305532,u6013,m399,LOUIS,But how do you know?
203978,L305531,u6012,m399,LESTAT,The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
203979,L305528,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
203980,L305527,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Have you ever been caught?
203981,L305521,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
203982,L305520,u6013,m399,LOUIS,But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
203983,L305519,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
203984,L305518,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Fascination...
203985,L305517,u6012,m399,LESTAT,There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
203986,L305515,u6013,m399,LOUIS,We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
203987,L305514,u6012,m399,LESTAT,I know. It gets cold so fast.
203988,L305505,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Do you think so?
203989,L305504,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
203990,L305496,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too."
203991,L305495,u6013,m399,LOUIS,And if I don't?
203992,L305494,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
203993,L305493,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
203994,L305492,u6013,m399,LOUIS,It can't be...
203995,L305491,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven."
203996,L305480,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
203997,L305479,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Dear God, what have I done?"
203998,L305478,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You have fed. You were made for this...
203999,L305477,u6013,m399,LOUIS,What have I done?
204000,L305475,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Forget the crucifix. Take him.
204001,L305474,u6013,m399,LOUIS,The crucifix -
204002,L305473,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Take him.
204003,L305470,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I want a woman.
204004,L305469,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Come, you're going to feed now."
204005,L305467,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Dying?
204006,L305466,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
204007,L305464,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Sure...
204008,L305463,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You're sure?
204009,L305458,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Yes...
204010,L305457,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Did I hear a yes?
204011,L305453,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
204012,L305452,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
204013,L305451,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You really want to be with them?
204014,L305450,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
204015,L305449,u6013,m399,LOUIS,But why do you want me?
204016,L305448,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
204017,L305447,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"I can't go through with it, I tell you."
204018,L305446,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?"
204019,L305445,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are."
204020,L305444,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean."
204021,L305443,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Kill me if you will, but I can't do this..."
204022,L305442,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You've just done it -
204023,L305441,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I can't do it.
204024,L305440,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Let's call that a start.
204025,L305437,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Call him.
204026,L305436,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"How do you mean, start?"
204027,L305435,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him."
204028,L305430,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I want it!
204029,L305429,u6012,m399,LESTAT,Vampires. We thrive on blood.
204030,L305428,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Give it to me!!!
204031,L305427,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?"
204032,L305426,u6013,m399,LOUIS,NO!!!!!
204033,L305425,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy..."
204034,L305424,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Diane!!!!
204035,L305419,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?"
204036,L305418,u6013,m399,LOUIS,What do you want from me?
204037,L305415,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Why should I be?
204038,L305414,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"You're not afraid of anything, are you?"
204039,L305413,u6012,m399,LESTAT,"And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?"
204040,L305412,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
204041,L305405,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Yes...
204042,L305404,u6012,m399,LESTAT,You want death? Is it death you want?
204043,L305403,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Then my luck would have changed.
204044,L305402,u6012,m399,LESTAT,They would have killed you -
204045,L306161,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
204046,L306160,u6015,m399,MALLOY,No...
204047,L306159,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?"
204048,L306157,u6015,m399,MALLOY,"If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this..."
204049,L306156,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
204050,L306153,u6015,m399,MALLOY,"You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself."
204051,L306152,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"It's over, I'm telling you..."
204052,L306151,u6015,m399,MALLOY,"But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?"
204053,L306150,u6013,m399,LOUIS,But it has. There is no more to tell.
204054,L306149,u6015,m399,MALLOY,No... it can't end like that...
204055,L306124,u6013,m399,LOUIS,He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
204056,L306123,u6015,m399,MALLOY,Lestat escaped the fire!
204057,L305858,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris..."
204058,L305857,u6015,m399,MALLOY,No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
204059,L305856,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper."
204060,L305855,u6015,m399,MALLOY,You found nothing?
204061,L305847,u6013,m399,LOUIS,He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
204062,L305846,u6015,m399,MALLOY,Did he die in the fire?
204063,L305752,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that..."
204064,L305751,u6015,m399,MALLOY,And did you lose her? Did she go?
204065,L305750,u6013,m399,LOUIS,How could I not? She had to know.
204066,L305749,u6015,m399,MALLOY,But why did you tell her?
204067,L305672,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine..."
204068,L305671,u6015,m399,MALLOY,He did it to make you stay with him!
204069,L305670,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Shall we go on?
204070,L305582,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know."
204071,L305581,u6015,m399,MALLOY,"You loved your wife, surely."
204072,L305580,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Can a vampire feel love?
204073,L305579,u6015,m399,MALLOY,You loved Yvette...
204074,L305489,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
204075,L305488,u6015,m399,MALLOY,What about coffins?
204076,L305487,u6013,m399,LOUIS,The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
204077,L305486,u6015,m399,MALLOY,The story about stakes through the heart?
204078,L305485,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes."
204079,L305484,u6015,m399,MALLOY,You can't look at them...
204080,L305483,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Oh, that rumour about crosses?"
204081,L305482,u6015,m399,MALLOY,You said the slave had a crucifix...
204082,L305391,u6013,m399,LOUIS,But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
204083,L305390,u6015,m399,MALLOY,Yes.
204084,L305389,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
204085,L305388,u6015,m399,MALLOY,"You're not lying to me, are you?"
204086,L305387,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?"
204087,L305386,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years."
204088,L305385,u6015,m399,MALLOY,How did you do that?
204089,L305381,u6013,m399,LOUIS,We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
204090,L305380,u6015,m399,MALLOY,But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
204091,L305379,u6013,m399,LOUIS,We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
204092,L305378,u6015,m399,MALLOY,"You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think..."
204093,L305377,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
204094,L305376,u6015,m399,MALLOY,You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
204095,L305374,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Perhaps lucky for both of us.
204096,L305373,u6015,m399,MALLOY,"Well, what a lucky break for me."
204097,L305372,u6013,m399,LOUIS,Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
204098,L305371,u6015,m399,MALLOY,"See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?"
204099,L305370,u6013,m399,LOUIS,I'm a vampire.
204100,L305369,u6015,m399,MALLOY,So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
204101,L305368,u6013,m399,LOUIS,It's just a room...
204102,L305367,u6015,m399,MALLOY,Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
204103,L305366,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"You followed me here, didn't you?"
204104,L305365,u6015,m399,MALLOY,So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
204105,L305364,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
204106,L305363,u6015,m399,MALLOY,"That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -"
204107,L305362,u6013,m399,LOUIS,So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
204108,L306059,u6014,m399,MADELEINE,Yes!
204109,L306058,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?"
204110,L306057,u6014,m399,MADELEINE,My daughter...
204111,L306056,u6013,m399,LOUIS,And the child who did die?
204112,L306055,u6014,m399,MADELEINE,A child who can't die...
204113,L306054,u6013,m399,LOUIS,"What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?"
204114,L306053,u6014,m399,MADELEINE,Yes.
204115,L306052,u6013,m399,LOUIS,And you know what you ask for?
204116,L306051,u6014,m399,MADELEINE,Yes...
204117,L306050,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You promise to care for her then?
204118,L306040,u6014,m399,MADELEINE,"Au contraire, monsieur, I have."
204119,L306039,u6013,m399,LOUIS,You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
204120,L308511,u6016,m400,BROOKS,"I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter."
204121,L308510,u6020,m400,KARLA,What the hell would you call this?
204122,L308509,u6016,m400,BROOKS,Sorry. Emergencies only.
204123,L308508,u6020,m400,KARLA,What about a radio?
204124,L308507,u6016,m400,BROOKS,"Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it."
204125,L308347,u6016,m400,BROOKS,July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
204126,L308346,u6020,m400,KARLA,Wait...Did you say off-season?
204127,L308345,u6016,m400,BROOKS,"And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need."
204128,L308344,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us."
204129,L308340,u6016,m400,BROOKS,Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
204130,L308339,u6020,m400,KARLA,Is that bad?
204131,L308338,u6016,m400,BROOKS,You're in 201 and 202.
204132,L308327,u6020,m400,KARLA,Checking in...Karla Wilson.
204133,L308326,u6016,m400,BROOKS,What can I do for you?
204134,L308505,u6016,m400,BROOKS,Phones went down a few minutes ago.
204135,L308504,u6019,m400,JULIE,Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
204136,L308501,u6016,m400,BROOKS,"Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days."
204137,L308500,u6019,m400,JULIE,I want off this island.
204138,L308489,u6016,m400,BROOKS,Who? Who is here?
204139,L308488,u6019,m400,JULIE,Listen to me. He's here.
204140,L308349,u6016,m400,BROOKS,It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
204141,L308348,u6019,m400,JULIE,Storm season?
204142,L308343,u6019,m400,JULIE,We haven't exchanged anything.
204143,L308342,u6016,m400,BROOKS,"Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?"
204144,L308341,u6019,m400,JULIE,Your what?
204145,L308334,u6016,m400,BROOKS,Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
204146,L308333,u6019,m400,JULIE,It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
204147,L308262,u6017,m400,DAVE,The guy looks dead.
204148,L308261,u6024,m400,RAY,No.
204149,L308260,u6017,m400,DAVE,"I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --"
204150,L308258,u6017,m400,DAVE,"No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched."
204151,L308257,u6024,m400,RAY,"I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming."
204152,L308256,u6017,m400,DAVE,"Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb."
204153,L308254,u6017,m400,DAVE,Stupid. What were you thinkng?
204154,L308253,u6024,m400,RAY,Stupid. Stupid.
204155,L308243,u6017,m400,DAVE,Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
204156,L308242,u6024,m400,RAY,"You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?"
204157,L308453,u6025,m400,TITUS,Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
204158,L308452,u6018,m400,DERRICK,I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
204159,L308451,u6025,m400,TITUS,Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
204160,L308450,u6018,m400,DERRICK,"There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out."
204161,L308449,u6025,m400,TITUS,"That's why you'll come with Titus, mon."
204162,L308448,u6018,m400,DERRICK,"Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain."
204163,L308447,u6025,m400,TITUS,"Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out."
204164,L308446,u6018,m400,DERRICK,"Get lost, you scared me."
204165,L308758,u6020,m400,KARLA,Is he?
204166,L308757,u6019,m400,JULIE,You're okay. Thank god.
204167,L308756,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Oh, god, it's you --"
204168,L308713,u6020,m400,KARLA,...Nancy?
204169,L308712,u6019,m400,JULIE,"No, you're not."
204170,L308711,u6020,m400,KARLA,I'm holding your hand!
204171,L308708,u6019,m400,JULIE,I'm right here. Grab my hand.
204172,L308707,u6020,m400,KARLA,Julie?
204173,L308705,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Come on, you can make it."
204174,L308704,u6020,m400,KARLA,I don't know...
204175,L308682,u6020,m400,KARLA,What do we do?
204176,L308681,u6019,m400,JULIE,There's no way to lock it.
204177,L308657,u6020,m400,KARLA,It's too late for that.
204178,L308656,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else."
204179,L308655,u6020,m400,KARLA,I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
204180,L308643,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Then, we fight --"
204181,L308642,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place."
204182,L308638,u6019,m400,JULIE,I've got to see.
204183,L308637,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Be careful, Julie."
204184,L308626,u6019,m400,JULIE,"We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good."
204185,L308625,u6020,m400,KARLA,I know I don't want to stay in here.
204186,L308616,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose."
204187,L308615,u6020,m400,KARLA,What do you mean?
204188,L308612,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Come on, Julie. You saw his room."
204189,L308611,u6019,m400,JULIE,Let him go. I believe him.
204190,L308584,u6019,m400,JULIE,Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
204191,L308583,u6020,m400,KARLA,Julie...
204192,L308582,u6019,m400,JULIE,They never found the body.
204193,L308581,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here."
204194,L308570,u6020,m400,KARLA,I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
204195,L308569,u6019,m400,JULIE,I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
204196,L308551,u6020,m400,KARLA,Just kidding.
204197,L308550,u6019,m400,JULIE,Karla!
204198,L308547,u6020,m400,KARLA,"No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach."
204199,L308546,u6019,m400,JULIE,Cancer in a box.
204200,L308535,u6020,m400,KARLA,I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
204201,L308534,u6019,m400,JULIE,Nice move.
204202,L308533,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?"
204203,L308532,u6019,m400,JULIE,"It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too."
204204,L308525,u6019,m400,JULIE,Some.
204205,L308524,u6020,m400,KARLA,You get any sleep at all?
204206,L308497,u6019,m400,JULIE,The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
204207,L308496,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?"
204208,L308419,u6019,m400,JULIE,Not me...no way...
204209,L308418,u6020,m400,KARLA,Yes.
204210,L308417,u6019,m400,JULIE,No.
204211,L308416,u6020,m400,KARLA,Yes.
204212,L308415,u6019,m400,JULIE,No way.
204213,L308411,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Okay, I won't."
204214,L308410,u6019,m400,JULIE,Don't even think about it.
204215,L308409,u6020,m400,KARLA,Karaoke -- perfect.
204216,L308397,u6019,m400,JULIE,I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
204217,L308396,u6020,m400,KARLA,He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
204218,L308395,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --"
204219,L308366,u6020,m400,KARLA,I also promised Tyrell.
204220,L308365,u6019,m400,JULIE,Karla! You promised.
204221,L308364,u6020,m400,KARLA,Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
204222,L308324,u6019,m400,JULIE,Where is everyone? I'll ask --
204223,L308323,u6020,m400,KARLA,Hello? Hello?
204224,L308296,u6019,m400,JULIE,"I will, and you remind me of the same thing."
204225,L308295,u6020,m400,KARLA,Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
204226,L308294,u6020,m400,KARLA,"No, I'm the King of the World."
204227,L308293,u6019,m400,JULIE,I'm the King of the World.
204228,L308278,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste."
204229,L308277,u6019,m400,JULIE,Oh!
204230,L308275,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Then, don't."
204231,L308274,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so..."
204232,L308273,u6019,m400,JULIE,He does work hard.
204233,L308272,u6020,m400,KARLA,He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
204234,L308271,u6019,m400,JULIE,"But, he said he'd try."
204235,L308270,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Julie, you left four messages... Four."
204236,L308269,u6019,m400,JULIE,He's not coming. I thought he was just...
204237,L308246,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Ray, come on. I want us to be together."
204238,L308245,u6020,m400,KARLA,You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
204239,L308209,u6020,m400,KARLA,"I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty."
204240,L308208,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Okay, okay. You're right."
204241,L308207,u6020,m400,KARLA,Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
204242,L308206,u6019,m400,JULIE,The number's unlisted...
204243,L308205,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact."
204244,L308204,u6019,m400,JULIE,That could break the machine.
204245,L308195,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway."
204246,L308194,u6019,m400,JULIE,Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
204247,L308191,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --"
204248,L308190,u6020,m400,KARLA,No means yes.
204249,L308189,u6019,m400,JULIE,No.
204250,L308188,u6020,m400,KARLA,Say yes.
204251,L308176,u6020,m400,KARLA,Yet. Nothing yet.
204252,L308175,u6019,m400,JULIE,There's nothing between Will and me.
204253,L308174,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street."
204254,L308173,u6019,m400,JULIE,I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
204255,L308172,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Yeah, right -- whatever."
204256,L308171,u6019,m400,JULIE,"I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed."
204257,L308170,u6020,m400,KARLA,"No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time."
204258,L308169,u6019,m400,JULIE,"That was heart attack time, Karla."
204259,L308168,u6020,m400,KARLA,"i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!"
204260,L308167,u6019,m400,JULIE,What are you doing in my closet?
204261,L308166,u6020,m400,KARLA,I thought you were out of town!
204262,L308165,u6019,m400,JULIE,What are you doing in my closet?
204263,L308164,u6020,m400,KARLA,I thought you were out of town!
204264,L308767,u6019,m400,JULIE,You know me to well.
204265,L308766,u6024,m400,RAY,Checking the locks again?
204266,L308765,u6024,m400,RAY,It's gonna be great.
204267,L308764,u6019,m400,JULIE,I love it here.
204268,L308763,u6024,m400,RAY,Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
204269,L308762,u6019,m400,JULIE,Never do that again.
204270,L308761,u6024,m400,RAY,Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
204271,L308760,u6019,m400,JULIE,Ray...what are you doing?
204272,L308250,u6019,m400,JULIE,Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
204273,L308249,u6024,m400,RAY,"Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time."
204274,L308248,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Will you try...for me, please?"
204275,L308247,u6024,m400,RAY,"Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it."
204276,L308241,u6024,m400,RAY,This weekend?
204277,L308240,u6019,m400,JULIE,"We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know..."
204278,L308239,u6024,m400,RAY,What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
204279,L308238,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her."
204280,L308236,u6019,m400,JULIE,It's okay.
204281,L308235,u6024,m400,RAY,"No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just..."
204282,L308234,u6019,m400,JULIE,"No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --"
204283,L308233,u6024,m400,RAY,Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
204284,L308158,u6019,m400,JULIE,It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
204285,L308157,u6024,m400,RAY,I understand something.
204286,L308156,u6019,m400,JULIE,I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
204287,L308155,u6024,m400,RAY,Can't what?
204288,L308154,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Ray, I can't..."
204289,L308152,u6019,m400,JULIE,Why are you being like this?
204290,L308151,u6024,m400,RAY,Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
204291,L308150,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Ray, we're just friend."
204292,L308149,u6024,m400,RAY,Yeah.
204293,L308148,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him."
204294,L308147,u6024,m400,RAY,I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
204295,L308669,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Wait, it's Nancy --"
204296,L308668,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Don't kill me --
204297,L308619,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --"
204298,L308618,u6019,m400,JULIE,I don't know.
204299,L308617,u6026,m400,TYRELL,You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
204300,L308596,u6026,m400,TYRELL,I told you.
204301,L308595,u6019,m400,JULIE,Voodoo.
204302,L308580,u6019,m400,JULIE,Ben Willis.
204303,L308579,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Who?
204304,L308578,u6019,m400,JULIE,We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
204305,L308495,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Fine. Show me the body.
204306,L308494,u6019,m400,JULIE,"I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there."
204307,L308187,u6026,m400,TYRELL,That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
204308,L308186,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature."
204309,L308185,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules."
204310,L308741,u6027,m400,WILL,"Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son."
204311,L308740,u6019,m400,JULIE,...Why?
204312,L308739,u6027,m400,WILL,"We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right."
204313,L308738,u6019,m400,JULIE,I trusted you.
204314,L308737,u6027,m400,WILL,"Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend."
204315,L308736,u6019,m400,JULIE,Why are you doing this to me?
204316,L308721,u6027,m400,WILL,I guess so.
204317,L308720,u6019,m400,JULIE,He's in it with Willis?
204318,L308719,u6027,m400,WILL,Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
204319,L308718,u6019,m400,JULIE,Did you get help?
204320,L308717,u6027,m400,WILL,Come on. We're gonna be okay.
204321,L308486,u6019,m400,JULIE,I wasn't dreaming.
204322,L308485,u6027,m400,WILL,"Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming."
204323,L308484,u6019,m400,JULIE,There was a body! I swear it!
204324,L308482,u6019,m400,JULIE,It's in my room!
204325,L308481,u6027,m400,WILL,What? What are you talking about? Where?
204326,L308436,u6019,m400,JULIE,Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
204327,L308435,u6027,m400,WILL,"Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off."
204328,L308434,u6019,m400,JULIE,No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
204329,L308433,u6027,m400,WILL,I scared you -- I crossed the line --
204330,L308432,u6019,m400,JULIE,"No, no, no. This was really sweet..."
204331,L308431,u6027,m400,WILL,It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
204332,L308430,u6019,m400,JULIE,"Oh, Will! I'm sorry."
204333,L308427,u6019,m400,JULIE,"He did something to the screen...it, it, said..."
204334,L308426,u6027,m400,WILL,"What do you mean, Julie?"
204335,L308425,u6019,m400,JULIE,It's...him.
204336,L308424,u6027,m400,WILL,Julie? What's wrong?
204337,L308373,u6027,m400,WILL,You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
204338,L308372,u6019,m400,JULIE,Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
204339,L308371,u6027,m400,WILL,You sure it's okay with you?
204340,L308353,u6019,m400,JULIE,It beets being on the mainland.
204341,L308352,u6027,m400,WILL,And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
204342,L308290,u6027,m400,WILL,Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
204343,L308289,u6019,m400,JULIE,You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
204344,L308288,u6027,m400,WILL,Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
204345,L308287,u6019,m400,JULIE,Deep breaths --
204346,L308286,u6027,m400,WILL,"What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second."
204347,L308285,u6019,m400,JULIE,Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
204348,L308198,u6027,m400,WILL,"I said, this...Do you want a drink?"
204349,L308197,u6019,m400,JULIE,What?
204350,L308196,u6027,m400,WILL,This was not my idea.
204351,L308143,u6027,m400,WILL,Are you sure?
204352,L308142,u6019,m400,JULIE,I'm okay.
204353,L308141,u6027,m400,WILL,Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
204354,L308140,u6019,m400,JULIE,Right. Now I remember.
204355,L308139,u6027,m400,WILL,To get out of Southport?
204356,L308138,u6019,m400,JULIE,I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
204357,L308137,u6027,m400,WILL,It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
204358,L308136,u6019,m400,JULIE,It was one year ago...
204359,L308135,u6019,m400,JULIE,"It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school."
204360,L308134,u6027,m400,WILL,"It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better."
204361,L308133,u6019,m400,JULIE,I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
204362,L308132,u6027,m400,WILL,I'm sorry.
204363,L308131,u6019,m400,JULIE,"It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me."
204364,L308130,u6027,m400,WILL,The shower again?
204365,L308128,u6027,m400,WILL,You don't seem fine.
204366,L308127,u6019,m400,JULIE,I'm fine.
204367,L308126,u6027,m400,WILL,You sure?
204368,L308125,u6019,m400,JULIE,I'm fine.
204369,L308124,u6027,m400,WILL,Julie! Wait! You okay?
204370,L308661,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"I don't know, but I'm starving."
204371,L308660,u6020,m400,KARLA,You think that's a good place to hide?
204372,L308653,u6026,m400,TYRELL,I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
204373,L308652,u6020,m400,KARLA,Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
204374,L308650,u6020,m400,KARLA,Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
204375,L308649,u6026,m400,TYRELL,I'll come with you.
204376,L308573,u6020,m400,KARLA,We gotta get out of here. Now.
204377,L308572,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho."
204378,L308528,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?"
204379,L308527,u6020,m400,KARLA,Hey --
204380,L308526,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode."
204381,L308464,u6026,m400,TYRELL,I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
204382,L308463,u6020,m400,KARLA,I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
204383,L308460,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care."
204384,L308459,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet."
204385,L308458,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Hello?
204386,L308457,u6020,m400,KARLA,You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
204387,L308441,u6020,m400,KARLA,'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
204388,L308440,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Why?
204389,L308439,u6020,m400,KARLA,Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
204390,L308400,u6020,m400,KARLA,"They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?"
204391,L308399,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Pretty cool bar.
204392,L308362,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Rio, baby!"
204393,L308361,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Guess the capital of Brazil --
204394,L308355,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!"
204395,L308354,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Oooh, the mainland --"
204396,L308351,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves."
204397,L308350,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip."
204398,L308292,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Honey, some folks just can't fly."
204399,L308291,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
204400,L308282,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on."
204401,L308281,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Is there a problem here?
204402,L308193,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance."
204403,L308192,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me."
204404,L308183,u6026,m400,TYRELL,I'll talk real slow.
204405,L308182,u6020,m400,KARLA,If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
204406,L308181,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you."
204407,L308180,u6020,m400,KARLA,I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
204408,L308179,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone."
204409,L308648,u6027,m400,WILL,He's probably the only one who can help us.
204410,L308647,u6020,m400,KARLA,Why? He can't help us.
204411,L308474,u6027,m400,WILL,Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?
204412,L308473,u6020,m400,KARLA,How's Julie?
204413,L308472,u6027,m400,WILL,"Ahh, that feels great."
204414,L308421,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James."
204415,L308420,u6027,m400,WILL,"Come on, it'll be fun."
204416,L308405,u6027,m400,WILL,"Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!"
204417,L308404,u6020,m400,KARLA,To a great weekend --
204418,L308280,u6020,m400,KARLA,I said we start having fun. And that means now.
204419,L308279,u6027,m400,WILL,"Julie, is everything cool? Karla said..."
204420,L308228,u6022,m400,MARK,We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
204421,L308227,u6020,m400,KARLA,Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
204422,L308225,u6020,m400,KARLA,No. Yes?
204423,L308224,u6022,m400,MARK,"Oh, no...Did you say Rio?"
204424,L308223,u6020,m400,KARLA,Rio de Janeiro!
204425,L308222,u6022,m400,MARK,"Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four..."
204426,L308221,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?"
204427,L308215,u6020,m400,KARLA,Yes!
204428,L308214,u6022,m400,MARK,How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
204429,L308213,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Well, I'm in school and --"
204430,L308212,u6022,m400,MARK,"Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?"
204431,L308211,u6020,m400,KARLA,"Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning."
204432,L308520,u6024,m400,RAY,I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
204433,L308519,u6021,m400,MAC,"Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period."
204434,L308518,u6024,m400,RAY,"Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too."
204435,L308517,u6021,m400,MAC,Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
204436,L308516,u6024,m400,RAY,How much?
204437,L308515,u6021,m400,MAC,"Well, there's some flaws in her..."
204438,L308514,u6024,m400,RAY,How much?
204439,L308513,u6021,m400,MAC,"Jeez, that's a full carat --"
204440,L308674,u6023,m400,NANCY,"Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before."
204441,L308673,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Must have missed the sign.
204442,L308672,u6023,m400,NANCY,You stumbled into my hiding place.
204443,L308671,u6026,m400,TYRELL,And so could you -- crazy fool.
204444,L308670,u6023,m400,NANCY,"I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --"
204445,L308493,u6026,m400,TYRELL,The rest of us see bathrobes.
204446,L308492,u6023,m400,NANCY,Cool.
204447,L308491,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
204448,L308490,u6023,m400,NANCY,What's going on?
204449,L308394,u6023,m400,NANCY,No. I shot him.
204450,L308393,u6026,m400,TYRELL,He leave you?
204451,L308392,u6023,m400,NANCY,Not anymore.
204452,L308391,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"What's the matter, boy trouble?"
204453,L308382,u6023,m400,NANCY,Wanna drink?
204454,L308381,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
204455,L308380,u6023,m400,NANCY,You guys lost?
204456,L308646,u6027,m400,WILL,I'll go find him.
204457,L308645,u6026,m400,TYRELL,What is up with that weirdo?
204458,L308644,u6027,m400,WILL,Where'd Estes go?
204459,L308603,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place."
204460,L308602,u6027,m400,WILL,"We'll only be a second, okay?"
204461,L308587,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
204462,L308586,u6027,m400,WILL,The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
204463,L308577,u6027,m400,WILL,Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
204464,L308576,u6026,m400,TYRELL,They were cut loose.
204465,L308559,u6027,m400,WILL,And do what with it?
204466,L308558,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Take this.
204467,L308542,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"Hey -- shut up, okay?"
204468,L308541,u6027,m400,WILL,"You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --"
204469,L308540,u6026,m400,TYRELL,They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
204470,L308537,u6027,m400,WILL,"They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss."
204471,L308536,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Where is everybody?
204472,L308531,u6027,m400,WILL,You don't have to be a jerk.
204473,L308530,u6026,m400,TYRELL,I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
204474,L308470,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Crowded.
204475,L308469,u6027,m400,WILL,How's the water?
204476,L308468,u6026,m400,TYRELL,There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
204477,L308389,u6027,m400,WILL,So why are you still here?
204478,L308388,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard."
204479,L308384,u6026,m400,TYRELL,"Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?"
204480,L308383,u6027,m400,WILL,We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
204481,L308299,u6027,m400,WILL,"See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail."
204482,L308298,u6026,m400,TYRELL,Can't talk right now.
204483,L309177,u6029,m401,CATHY,She's in her room.
204484,L309176,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,Where is Miss Wollsten?
204485,L308897,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
204486,L308896,u6029,m401,CATHY,"How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps."
204487,L308895,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
204488,L308894,u6029,m401,CATHY,"How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?"
204489,L308893,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,"You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece - the dancing, the singing and the white marble --"
204490,L309242,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
204491,L309241,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Goodbye.
204492,L309216,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Thank you, I'll do that. Good night."
204493,L309215,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
204494,L309214,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Well
204495,L309213,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
204496,L309212,u6033,m401,OLIVER,All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
204497,L309211,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
204498,L309210,u6033,m401,OLIVER,I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
204499,L309209,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,"Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves."
204500,L309208,u6033,m401,OLIVER,It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
204501,L309183,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,"In case you do so, would you --"
204502,L309182,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland."
204503,L308974,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,Or even spirit messages from the next world.
204504,L308973,u6033,m401,OLIVER,I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
204505,L308938,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,"That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly."
204506,L308937,u6033,m401,OLIVER,He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk 	he staggered.
204507,L308934,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,He's dead. I want the General to see him.
204508,L308933,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Drunk again?
204509,L308932,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks
204510,L308838,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
204511,L308837,u6033,m401,OLIVER,He is exhausted.
204512,L308826,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"You collect these to sell, abroad?"
204513,L308825,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
204514,L308798,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
204515,L308797,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here."
204516,L308796,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
204517,L309085,u6030,m401,DR. DROSSOS,I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
204518,L309084,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
204519,L309065,u6030,m401,DR. DROSSOS,You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
204520,L309064,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,My friend -- what can one say --
204521,L309063,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,) You feel the symptoms?
204522,L309060,u6030,m401,DR. DROSSOS,I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
204523,L309059,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
204524,L309006,u6030,m401,DR. DROSSOS,Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
204525,L309005,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,We will see who is the first to die.
204526,L309004,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
204527,L309003,u6030,m401,DR. DROSSOS,You're just talking nonsense.
204528,L309002,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,"I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little."
204529,L309001,u6030,m401,DR. DROSSOS,She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
204530,L308998,u6030,m401,DR. DROSSOS,They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
204531,L308997,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
204532,L308995,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,Good winds and bad winds!
204533,L308994,u6030,m401,DR. DROSSOS,"If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours."
204534,L309193,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
204535,L309192,u6031,m401,GENERAL,No.  She shall not be left here.
204536,L309191,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
204537,L308960,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
204538,L308959,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,"That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking."
204539,L308958,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
204540,L308944,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,"In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was - perhaps it was."
204541,L308943,u6031,m401,GENERAL,We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
204542,L308942,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,I'm not sure that it is the plague.
204543,L308840,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
204544,L308839,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
204545,L308818,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I donut understand.
204546,L308817,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,"I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions."
204547,L308816,u6031,m401,GENERAL,All the graves?
204548,L308815,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
204549,L308814,u6031,m401,GENERAL,But why?
204550,L308813,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,They were gore before I came here.
204551,L308812,u6031,m401,GENERAL,The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
204552,L308800,u6028,m401,ALBRECHT,This was once a cemetery.
204553,L308799,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
204554,L309180,u6029,m401,CATHY,I don't know now without my father.
204555,L309179,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?"
204556,L309094,u6029,m401,CATHY,"If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me"
204557,L309093,u6033,m401,OLIVER,There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
204558,L309092,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it."
204559,L309091,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Poor Cathy --
204560,L309090,u6029,m401,CATHY,"My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!"
204561,L309075,u6029,m401,CATHY,Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
204562,L309074,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --"
204563,L309073,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --"
204564,L309070,u6033,m401,OLIVER,On my word! That's what they believe.
204565,L309069,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!"
204566,L309057,u6029,m401,CATHY,I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
204567,L309056,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Where's Thea?
204568,L309008,u6029,m401,CATHY,No one can take my father's place.
204569,L309007,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --"
204570,L308967,u6033,m401,OLIVER,I think not.
204571,L308966,u6029,m401,CATHY,You're not leaving tomorrow..?
204572,L308965,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Sleep well.
204573,L308964,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Good night, Oliver."
204574,L308947,u6029,m401,CATHY,Thank you.
204575,L308946,u6033,m401,OLIVER,How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
204576,L308945,u6029,m401,CATHY,I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
204577,L308867,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?"
204578,L308866,u6029,m401,CATHY,I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
204579,L308862,u6029,m401,CATHY,"M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself."
204580,L308861,u6033,m401,OLIVER,I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
204581,L308805,u6029,m401,CATHY,"That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course."
204582,L308804,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn."
204583,L309205,u6031,m401,GENERAL,They shall not hurt you
204584,L309204,u6029,m401,CATHY,Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
204585,L309203,u6031,m401,GENERAL,In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
204586,L309202,u6029,m401,CATHY,It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
204587,L309163,u6029,m401,CATHY,"No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there."
204588,L309162,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
204589,L309160,u6029,m401,CATHY,How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
204590,L309159,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
204591,L309158,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I was looking for you.
204592,L309157,u6029,m401,CATHY,What are you doing?
204593,L309105,u6031,m401,GENERAL,How old is she?
204594,L309104,u6029,m401,CATHY,She has never mentioned her family.
204595,L309103,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
204596,L309102,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think."
204597,L309101,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
204598,L309099,u6029,m401,CATHY,"I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care."
204599,L309098,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
204600,L309222,u6029,m401,CATHY,"We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was."
204601,L309221,u6035,m401,THEA,"It was, the plague"
204602,L309220,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?"
204603,L309219,u6035,m401,THEA,She is dead  at peace.
204604,L309218,u6029,m401,CATHY,"When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else."
204605,L309217,u6035,m401,THEA,"You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything."
204606,L308927,u6035,m401,THEA,I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
204607,L308926,u6029,m401,CATHY,That should decide it or you --
204608,L308925,u6035,m401,THEA,I felt he did not like me.
204609,L308923,u6035,m401,THEA,I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know
204610,L308922,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute."
204611,L308921,u6029,m401,CATHY,The General  you don't even know him.
204612,L308920,u6035,m401,THEA,But one must love a father.
204613,L308919,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not."
204614,L308907,u6035,m401,THEA,My last name is Pherides.
204615,L308906,u6029,m401,CATHY,"I have forgotten it, dear."
204616,L308905,u6035,m401,THEA,You have forgotten my last name?
204617,L308904,u6029,m401,CATHY,What is it -- what are you talking about?
204618,L308903,u6035,m401,THEA,"I do not know him, but I have seen him."
204619,L308902,u6029,m401,CATHY,Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
204620,L308901,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me."
204621,L308900,u6035,m401,THEA,"I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?"
204622,L308899,u6029,m401,CATHY,What an odd question!
204623,L308898,u6035,m401,THEA,Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
204624,L308864,u6029,m401,CATHY,Thea is an orphan.
204625,L308863,u6035,m401,THEA,You are fortunate in your father.
204626,L308842,u6035,m401,THEA,And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
204627,L308841,u6029,m401,CATHY,"The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort"
204628,L309173,u6029,m401,CATHY,Wouldn't I?
204629,L309172,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,You wouldn't tell that
204630,L309171,u6029,m401,CATHY,When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!
204631,L309169,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
204632,L309168,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Really, this is idiotic!"
204633,L309167,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man   working at him   turning him against Thea.
204634,L309166,u6029,m401,CATHY,Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
204635,L309165,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,"I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you."
204636,L309031,u6029,m401,CATHY,No. I mean your other secret -	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
204637,L309030,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,That your father and I
204638,L309029,u6029,m401,CATHY,You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
204639,L309028,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,"You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you."
204640,L309027,u6029,m401,CATHY,"Why, I'm fond of Thea."
204641,L309026,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
204642,L309025,u6029,m401,CATHY,What if he is?
204643,L309024,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,"Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -"
204644,L309023,u6029,m401,CATHY,What would I be thinking?
204645,L309022,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
204646,L309021,u6029,m401,CATHY,You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
204647,L309020,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,"Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life you've ruined mine"
204648,L309019,u6029,m401,CATHY,How do you know what my father thought - -
204649,L309018,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
204650,L309017,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed  everytime you can't get your own way.
204651,L309016,u6029,m401,CATHY,Miss Wollsten!
204652,L309015,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,"They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live."
204653,L309014,u6029,m401,CATHY,Whet do you mean?
204654,L309013,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,"I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy."
204655,L309155,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
204656,L309154,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
204657,L309153,u6031,m401,GENERAL,You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
204658,L309152,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,"No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything."
204659,L309151,u6031,m401,GENERAL,If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
204660,L309150,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.
204661,L309149,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I don't understand you.
204662,L309148,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.
204663,L309147,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Yes?
204664,L309146,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
204665,L309144,u6031,m401,GENERAL,He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
204666,L309143,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
204667,L309142,u6031,m401,GENERAL,"He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him."
204668,L309141,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,"I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned.."
204669,L309140,u6031,m401,GENERAL,"Woman, what are you doing here?"
204670,L308982,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell
204671,L308981,u6031,m401,GENERAL,"This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division."
204672,L308980,u6032,m401,MISS WOLLSTEN,No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
204673,L308860,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I will go with you.
204674,L308859,u6034,m401,ST. AUBYN,"This girl -- Thea - is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks."
204675,L308858,u6031,m401,GENERAL,This girl --
204676,L308856,u6034,m401,ST. AUBYN,Why -- no not before Thea came
204677,L308855,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
204678,L308854,u6034,m401,ST. AUBYN,"Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --"
204679,L308853,u6031,m401,GENERAL,What is her illness?
204680,L308852,u6034,m401,ST. AUBYN,She's not too well.
204681,L308851,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Your daughter is ill.
204682,L308850,u6034,m401,ST. AUBYN,"Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know."
204683,L308849,u6031,m401,GENERAL,You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
204684,L308847,u6034,m401,ST. AUBYN,"Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --"
204685,L308846,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Her family name?
204686,L308845,u6034,m401,ST. AUBYN,Theodosia.
204687,L308844,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Her name is Thea?
204688,L308843,u6034,m401,ST. AUBYN,I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..
204689,L309239,u6033,m401,OLIVER,She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
204690,L309238,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Daughter -- my daughter --
204691,L309237,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
204692,L309236,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Theodosia --
204693,L309199,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I shall not leave the island
204694,L309198,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Come - you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
204695,L309197,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I have had command for the last time -
204696,L309055,u6033,m401,OLIVER,When you make sense I'll listen.
204697,L309054,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Listen to what I say --
204698,L309053,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -"
204699,L309052,u6031,m401,GENERAL,If I told you  you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you  the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -
204700,L309051,u6033,m401,OLIVER,And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
204701,L309050,u6031,m401,GENERAL,You are my friend.
204702,L309049,u6033,m401,OLIVER,I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
204703,L309048,u6031,m401,GENERAL,"In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her."
204704,L309047,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
204705,L309046,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back pale -- sick -- she died --
204706,L309045,u6033,m401,OLIVER,How did she die?
204707,L309044,u6031,m401,GENERAL,"She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me."
204708,L309043,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful."
204709,L309042,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Thea is so like her  in every feature
204710,L308972,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
204711,L308971,u6033,m401,OLIVER,We still don't know that it's the plague
204712,L308970,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Better no general than one carrying the plague.
204713,L308969,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"But the war, the army  they need you."
204714,L308968,u6031,m401,GENERAL,"Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay."
204715,L308941,u6031,m401,GENERAL,The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
204716,L308940,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?"
204717,L308939,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
204718,L308929,u6031,m401,GENERAL,We have no time for that.
204719,L308928,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl."
204720,L308918,u6031,m401,GENERAL,It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
204721,L308917,u6033,m401,OLIVER,I can't understand that.
204722,L308916,u6031,m401,GENERAL,It makes me fear her.
204723,L308915,u6033,m401,OLIVER,But that should make you like her.
204724,L308914,u6031,m401,GENERAL,"I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head."
204725,L308913,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Oh, now  now look here"
204726,L308912,u6031,m401,GENERAL,There is something evil about her.
204727,L308911,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Thea?
204728,L308910,u6031,m401,GENERAL,I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl
204729,L308909,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"It doesn't seem to bother you much, General."
204730,L308908,u6031,m401,GENERAL,"You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy."
204731,L308792,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
204732,L308791,u6031,m401,GENERAL,She is not there. The coffin is gone.
204733,L308787,u6033,m401,OLIVER,I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
204734,L308786,u6031,m401,GENERAL,There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
204735,L308785,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Do you mind if I go with you?
204736,L308783,u6031,m401,GENERAL,You were at those battles as a spectator   I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me  those men out there  dead or dying  by my order -- because I willed it so.
204737,L308782,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?"
204738,L308781,u6031,m401,GENERAL,"You know that sound, Oliver?"
204739,L308779,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -"
204740,L308778,u6031,m401,GENERAL,Hero?
204741,L308777,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
204742,L309138,u6035,m401,THEA,No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
204743,L309137,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -"
204744,L309136,u6035,m401,THEA,"For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --"
204745,L309135,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man."
204746,L309133,u6035,m401,THEA,"Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --"
204747,L309132,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter."
204748,L309131,u6035,m401,THEA,It is for that he hates me.
204749,L309130,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? ""He stole your mother"" -"
204750,L309129,u6035,m401,THEA,It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
204751,L309128,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved."
204752,L309127,u6035,m401,THEA,He hates all my race.
204753,L309126,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Why in the world can't you?
204754,L309125,u6035,m401,THEA,I can't.
204755,L309124,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Well, tell, him."
204756,L309123,u6035,m401,THEA,He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
204757,L309122,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble  the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village."
204758,L309121,u6035,m401,THEA,The General threatened me.
204759,L309120,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"Thea, what's wrong?"
204760,L309072,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"You see? Thea believes it, too!"
204761,L309071,u6035,m401,THEA,Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
204762,L309038,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
204763,L309037,u6035,m401,THEA,"Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him."
204764,L309036,u6033,m401,OLIVER,"What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?"
204765,L309035,u6033,m401,OLIVER,Everything's so simple. I like you.
204766,L309034,u6035,m401,THEA,I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
204767,L309033,u6033,m401,OLIVER,You're crying. Why?
204768,L311714,u6059,m402,POTTER,So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
204769,L311713,u6036,m402,BAILEY,"Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got."
204770,L311712,u6036,m402,BAILEY,"Well, all right . . ."
204771,L311711,u6059,m402,POTTER,Are you running a business or a charity ward?
204772,L311710,u6036,m402,BAILEY,But they're somebody's children.
204773,L311707,u6036,m402,BAILEY,I can't do that. These families have children.
204774,L311706,u6059,m402,POTTER,Then foreclose!
204775,L311705,u6036,m402,BAILEY,"Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work."
204776,L311701,u6036,m402,BAILEY,All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
204777,L311700,u6059,m402,POTTER,"Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse."
204778,L311699,u6036,m402,BAILEY,"I'm not crying, Mr. Potter."
204779,L312240,u6051,m402,MAN,I'm hurrying.
204780,L312239,u6037,m402,BERT,Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
204781,L312238,u6051,m402,MAN,All right  all right.
204782,L312237,u6037,m402,BERT,Get that ladder up here.
204783,L312236,u6037,m402,BERT,"The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder."
204784,L312235,u6051,m402,MAN,Who?
204785,L312234,u6037,m402,BERT,"Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming."
204786,L312232,u6051,m402,MAN,"Sure I have, but I got rid of it."
204787,L312231,u6037,m402,BERT,How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
204788,L312230,u6051,m402,MAN,"Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this."
204789,L312722,u6045,m402,GEORGE,What did . . .
204790,L312721,u6037,m402,BERT,"Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?"
204791,L312720,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Don't . . . George?
204792,L312719,u6037,m402,BERT,"What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?"
204793,L312674,u6037,m402,BERT,"I hate to do this, fella."
204794,L312673,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me."
204795,L312670,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?"
204796,L312669,u6037,m402,BERT,Stand back.
204797,L312668,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
204798,L312667,u6037,m402,BERT,"All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you."
204799,L311767,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?"
204800,L311766,u6037,m402,BERT,George . . .
204801,L312368,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter."
204802,L312367,u6038,m402,CARTER,"Yeah, very funny."
204803,L312366,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke."
204804,L312365,u6038,m402,CARTER,"Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year."
204805,L312364,u6045,m402,GEORGE,We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
204806,L312363,u6038,m402,CARTER,Merry Christmas.
204807,L312362,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas."
204808,L312361,u6038,m402,CARTER,Carter  bank examiner.
204809,L312360,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Good morning, sir."
204810,L312708,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Where is she?
204811,L312707,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,She's . . .
204812,L312704,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,I'm not supposed to tell.
204813,L312703,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is."
204814,L312702,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,I . . .
204815,L312701,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"I don't know how you know these things, but tell me  where is she?"
204816,L312700,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Oh, well, I can't . . ."
204817,L312699,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Where's Mary?
204818,L312698,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Yes, George?"
204819,L312697,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Clarence . . .
204820,L312694,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?"
204821,L312693,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
204822,L312692,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
204823,L312691,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,You know where he lives?
204824,L312642,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,Zuzu's petals.
204825,L312641,u6045,m402,GEORGE,What?
204826,L312640,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . ."
204827,L312639,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey."
204828,L312638,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,You're nobody. You have no identity.
204829,L312637,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Then if I wasn't born, who am I?"
204830,L312636,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born."
204831,L312635,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?"
204832,L312634,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"No, of course not."
204833,L312633,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?"
204834,L312632,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . ."
204835,L312631,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . ."
204836,L312619,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,Why? Don't they believe in angels?
204837,L312618,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here."
204838,L312617,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings."
204839,L312616,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Made what?
204840,L312615,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
204841,L312613,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
204842,L312612,u6045,m402,GEORGE,No wonder you jumped in the river.
204843,L312611,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,No.
204844,L312610,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"You don't huh? Well, you got any money?"
204845,L312609,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,No.
204846,L312608,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?"
204847,L312607,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
204848,L312606,u6045,m402,GEORGE,What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
204849,L312597,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel."
204850,L312596,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,It isn't me!
204851,L312595,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!"
204852,L312587,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it."
204853,L312586,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,You have no car.
204854,L312584,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right."
204855,L312583,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
204856,L312581,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,Our clothes are dry.
204857,L312580,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . ."
204858,L312578,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George."
204859,L312577,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water."
204860,L312575,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
204861,L312574,u6045,m402,GEORGE,What did you say?
204862,L312573,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born."
204863,L312572,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I said I wish I'd never been born.
204864,L312571,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,What'd you say?
204865,L312569,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . ."
204866,L312568,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
204867,L312567,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Oh, tut, tut, tut."
204868,L312566,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub."
204869,L312565,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven."
204870,L312564,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
204871,L312563,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,By letting me help you.
204872,L312562,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?"
204873,L312561,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
204874,L312560,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
204875,L312559,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?"
204876,L312558,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
204877,L312557,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
204878,L312556,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
204879,L312555,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
204880,L312553,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Angel, Second Class."
204881,L312552,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
204882,L312551,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Clarence Odbody, A-S-2."
204883,L312550,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, who are you, then?"
204884,L312549,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Oh, no."
204885,L312548,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"What are you, a mind reader or something?"
204886,L312547,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy."
204887,L312540,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,Suicide.
204888,L312539,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Go through with what?
204889,L312538,u6039,m402,CLARENCE,"Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?"
204890,L312537,u6045,m402,GEORGE,You what? To save me?
204891,L312334,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,"Yes, but George . . ."
204892,L312333,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
204893,L312318,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,No!
204894,L312317,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,"Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls."
204895,L311983,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,"Yes, but what happened to George?"
204896,L311982,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,"That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American."
204897,L311981,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,I know. I know. He didn't go.
204898,L311744,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,"Well, wait and see."
204899,L311743,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
204900,L311742,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,Not a soul.
204901,L311741,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,"It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?"
204902,L311740,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,That's the kid.
204903,L311739,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,"Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist."
204904,L311738,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,George Bailey.
204905,L311737,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,Who is it?
204906,L311736,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,I want you to take a good look at that face.
204907,L311735,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,What did you stop it for?
204908,L311640,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,"That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on."
204909,L311639,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,A boy?
204910,L311638,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,"That's your problem, George Bailey."
204911,L311637,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,"Hey, who's that?"
204912,L311636,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,"Oh, wonderful!"
204913,L311635,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,"If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself."
204914,L311634,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,"Why, yes. This is amazing."
204915,L311633,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,"Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?"
204916,L311632,u6040,m402,CLARENCE'S VOICE,Where? I don't see a thing.
204917,L311631,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,"Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?"

204942,L311977,u6042,m402,DR. CAMPBELL,That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
204943,L311976,u6045,m402,GEORGE,What's that?
204944,L311955,u6042,m402,DR. CAMPBELL,It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
204945,L311954,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Thank you very much.

204950,L312661,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Of course it's the place.
204951,L312660,u6043,m402,ERNIE,Is this the place?
204952,L312659,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
204953,L312658,u6043,m402,ERNIE,"Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life."
204954,L312656,u6043,m402,ERNIE,All right.
204955,L312655,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

204959,L312141,u6043,m402,ERNIE,"Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles."
204960,L312140,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab."
204961,L312139,u6043,m402,ERNIE,"If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me."
204962,L311765,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Hi, Bert."
204963,L311764,u6043,m402,ERNIE,"Hiya, George!"

204968,L311615,u6044,m402,FRANKLIN'S VOICE,"Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple. Joseph, send for Clarence."
204969,L311614,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,"Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit."
204970,L311613,u6044,m402,FRANKLIN'S VOICE,"Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along."
204971,L311612,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,"That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again."
204972,L311611,u6044,m402,FRANKLIN'S VOICE,"George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?"
204973,L311610,u6049,m402,JOSEPH'S VOICE,Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
204974,L311609,u6044,m402,FRANKLIN'S VOICE,"Hello, Joseph, trouble?"
204975,L312689,u6050,m402,MA BAILEY,"That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong."
204976,L312688,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Today, over at the house."
204977,L312687,u6050,m402,MA BAILEY,When'd you see him last?

204979,L312685,u6050,m402,MA BAILEY,Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
204980,L312684,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it."
204981,L312682,u6050,m402,MA BAILEY,Mother? What do you want?
204982,L312681,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Mother . . .

204989,L312472,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden."
204990,L312471,u6065,m402,ZUZU,I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
204991,L312470,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Will you try to get some sleep?
204992,L312469,u6065,m402,ZUZU,What?

204995,L312465,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together."
204996,L312464,u6065,m402,ZUZU,"Look, Daddy . . . paste it."
204997,L312463,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink."

205006,L312273,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, now, don't rub it in."
205007,L312272,u6060,m402,SAM,"Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold."
205008,L312271,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam."
205009,L312268,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Oh . . .

205020,L311751,u6048,m402,JOE,What boat you sailing on?
205021,L311749,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge."
205022,L311748,u6048,m402,JOE,No charge.
205023,L311747,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?"
205024,L311746,u6048,m402,JOE,"I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?"
205025,L311745,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Big  see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one."

205032,L312522,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
205033,L312521,u6052,m402,MARTINI,He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
205034,L312255,u6045,m402,GEORGE,All in . . .

205039,L312049,u6056,m402,MRS. BAILEY,"Oh, George!"
205040,L312048,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking."
205041,L312047,u6056,m402,MRS. BAILEY,Uh-huh.
205042,L312046,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?"
205043,L312045,u6045,m402,GEORGE,And all's fair in love and war?
205044,L312044,u6056,m402,MRS. BAILEY,"And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls."

205100,L312599,u6057,m402,NICK,You want a martini?
205101,L312525,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . ."
205102,L312524,u6057,m402,NICK,"Yes, you bet."
205103,L311838,u6058,m402,POP,"Have a good time, son."
205104,L311837,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party."
205105,L311835,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy."
205106,L311834,u6058,m402,POP,"This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here."
205107,L311833,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?"
205108,L311832,u6058,m402,POP,"Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son."
205109,L311831,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office."
205110,L311830,u6058,m402,POP,I know it's soon to talk about it.
205111,L311825,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"No, I'll settle for half that in cash."
205112,L311824,u6058,m402,POP,Still after that first million before you're thirty.
205113,L311823,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about."
205114,L311822,u6058,m402,POP,"I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college."
205115,L311821,u6045,m402,GEORGE,How's that?
205116,L311820,u6058,m402,POP,"Maybe you were born older, George."
205117,L311819,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, no younger than I was."
205118,L311818,u6058,m402,POP,He's pretty young for that job.
205119,L311817,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go."
205120,L311816,u6058,m402,POP,"Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night."
205121,L311815,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?"
205122,L311801,u6058,m402,POP,"Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess."
205123,L311800,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
205124,L311799,u6058,m402,POP,"I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit."
205125,L311798,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Oh . . .
205126,L311797,u6058,m402,POP,"Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today."
205127,L311796,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired."
205128,L311795,u6058,m402,POP,"Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you."
205129,L312763,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Harry . . . Harry . . .
205130,L312762,u6047,m402,HARRY,"Hello, George, how are you?"
205131,L311994,u6047,m402,HARRY,"Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute."
205132,L311993,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go."
205133,L311992,u6047,m402,HARRY,"Say, where's Mother?"
205134,L311991,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, am I glad to see you."
205135,L311942,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Did you get a doctor?
205136,L311941,u6047,m402,HARRY,"Come on, George, let's hurry."
205137,L311940,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go."
205138,L311810,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I hope it works.
205139,L311809,u6047,m402,HARRY,"Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too."
205140,L311808,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"What do you mean, and be bored to death?"
205141,L311805,u6047,m402,HARRY,Very funny. Very funny.
205142,L311804,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Got a match?
205143,L311868,u6053,m402,MARTY,"Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life."
205144,L311867,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids."
205145,L311864,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
205146,L311863,u6053,m402,MARTY,"Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?"
205147,L311862,u6045,m402,GEORGE,What's that?
205148,L311861,u6053,m402,MARTY,"Do me a favor, will you, George?"
205149,L311860,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week."
205150,L311859,u6053,m402,MARTY,George.
205151,L312758,u6064,m402,VIOLET,"I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind."
205152,L312757,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Violet Bick!
205153,L312403,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Now, let's hear from you . . ."
205154,L312402,u6064,m402,VIOLET,Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
205155,L312401,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Say hello to New York for me.
205156,L312398,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls."
205157,L312397,u6064,m402,VIOLET,"I know, but . . ."
205158,L312396,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?"
205159,L312395,u6064,m402,VIOLET,"No, George, don't . . ."
205160,L312390,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here."
205161,L312389,u6064,m402,VIOLET,"George, can I see you for a second?"
205162,L312065,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . ."
205163,L312064,u6064,m402,VIOLET,Huh?
205164,L312063,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
205165,L312059,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library."
205166,L312058,u6064,m402,VIOLET,Where are you going?
205167,L312057,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Nothing.
205168,L312056,u6064,m402,VIOLET,What gives?
205169,L312055,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Hello, Vi."
205170,L312054,u6064,m402,VIOLET,"Hello, Georgie-Porgie."
205171,L311858,u6064,m402,VIOLET,"Hello, what am I bid?"
205172,L311857,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Hello, Violet."
205173,L311856,u6064,m402,VIOLET,"Hey, George . . ."
205174,L311770,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there."
205175,L311769,u6064,m402,VIOLET,"Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey."
205176,L311655,u6064,m402,VIOLET,She was here first.
205177,L311654,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Two cents worth of shoelaces?
205178,L312419,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
205179,L312418,u6045,m402,GEORGE,And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
205180,L312417,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,This way.
205181,L312416,u6045,m402,GEORGE,All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
205182,L312415,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
205183,L312414,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Now look, did you buy anything?"
205184,L312222,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,We'll save them for seed. A toast!
205185,L312221,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
205186,L312220,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,Those Rockefellers!
205187,L312180,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
205188,L312179,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there."
205189,L312174,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Hello?
205190,L312173,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter."
205191,L312172,u6045,m402,GEORGE,The whole town's gone crazy.
205192,L312171,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . ."
205193,L312170,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Holy mackerel!
205194,L312169,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe."
205195,L312168,u6045,m402,GEORGE,All of it?
205196,L312167,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
205197,L312166,u6045,m402,GEORGE,When?
205198,L312165,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
205199,L312164,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"All right now, what happened? How did it start?"
205200,L312163,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle."
205201,L312162,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Why didn't you call me?
205202,L312159,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,George . . .
205203,L312158,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?"
205204,L312018,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"That way, huh?"
205205,L312017,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
205206,L312016,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . ."
205207,L312015,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Right down here.
205208,L312014,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?"
205209,L312002,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?"
205210,L312001,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"Well, what do you know  wife."
205211,L311996,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,How do you do.
205212,L311995,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Hello.
205213,L311988,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,Peanut?
205214,L311987,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles."
205215,L311986,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
205216,L311693,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
205217,L311692,u6045,m402,GEORGE,It's important.
205218,L311691,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"Some other time, George."
205219,L311690,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy."
205220,L311689,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?"
205221,L312510,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Five hundred dollars.
205222,L312509,u6059,m402,POTTER,Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
205223,L312507,u6059,m402,POTTER,"I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?"
205224,L312506,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me."
205225,L312505,u6059,m402,POTTER,"Well, what about all your other friends?"
205226,L312504,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
205227,L312503,u6059,m402,POTTER,"Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?"
205228,L312502,u6059,m402,POTTER,"What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick."
205229,L312501,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"No, sir. No, sir. I haven't."
205230,L312500,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . ."
205231,L312499,u6059,m402,POTTER,Have you notified the police?
205232,L312498,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Yes, sir."
205233,L312300,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"All right, sir."
205234,L312299,u6059,m402,POTTER,"In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers."
205235,L312298,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I'd like to do that.
205236,L312297,u6059,m402,POTTER,"Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife."
205237,L312296,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?"
205238,L312295,u6059,m402,POTTER,"Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?"
205239,L312294,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, what about the Building and Loan?"
205240,L312293,u6059,m402,POTTER,"Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard."
205241,L312292,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey."
205242,L312291,u6059,m402,POTTER,"You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?"
205243,L312287,u6059,m402,POTTER,"The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week."
205244,L312286,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest."
205245,L312285,u6059,m402,POTTER,You like it? I'll send you a box.
205246,L312284,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter."
205247,L311963,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!"
205248,L311962,u6059,m402,POTTER,I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
205249,L311961,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!"
205250,L311960,u6059,m402,POTTER,"You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . ."
205251,L311959,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Yes, sir."
205252,L311709,u6059,m402,POTTER,They're not my children.
205253,L311708,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Pop!
205254,L311704,u6059,m402,POTTER,Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
205255,L311703,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Pop!
205256,L312132,u6061,m402,SAM'S VOICE,"Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . ."
205257,L312131,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Money? Yeah . . . well, a little."
205258,L312130,u6061,m402,SAM'S VOICE,"That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?"
205259,L312129,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down."
205260,L312128,u6061,m402,SAM'S VOICE,"Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?"
205261,L312127,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Rochester? Well, why Rochester?"
205262,L312126,u6061,m402,SAM'S VOICE,"Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?"
205263,L312125,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
205264,L312124,u6061,m402,SAM'S VOICE,"I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?"
205265,L312746,u6054,m402,MARY,You have no idea what happened . . .
205266,L312745,u6045,m402,GEORGE,You have no idea what's happened to me.
205267,L312744,u6054,m402,MARY,"Oh, George, George!"
205268,L312743,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!"
205269,L312742,u6054,m402,MARY,"Oh, George, George, George."
205270,L312741,u6054,m402,MARY,"George, darling! Where have you been?"
205271,L312740,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Mary! Mary!
205272,L312455,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Going up to see Zuzu.
205273,L312454,u6054,m402,MARY,Where're you going?
205274,L312451,u6054,m402,MARY,"Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right."
205275,L312450,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Is she running a temperature? What is it?
205276,L312449,u6054,m402,MARY,"Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about."
205277,L312448,u6045,m402,GEORGE,The doctor? Was the doctor here?
205278,L312447,u6054,m402,MARY,Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
205279,L312446,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"What is it, a sore throat or what?"
205280,L312445,u6054,m402,MARY,"Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat."
205281,L312444,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
205282,L312431,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Left them at the office.
205283,L312430,u6054,m402,MARY,Where's your coat and hat?
205284,L312429,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Yeah, just started."
205285,L312428,u6054,m402,MARY,Is it snowing?
205286,L312314,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?"
205287,L312313,u6054,m402,MARY,George Bailey lassos stork.
205288,L312312,u6054,m402,MARY,My baby.
205289,L312311,u6045,m402,GEORGE,You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
205290,L312310,u6054,m402,MARY,I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
205291,L312309,u6045,m402,GEORGE,You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
205292,L312308,u6054,m402,MARY,To keep from being an old maid.
205293,L312307,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?"
205294,L312306,u6054,m402,MARY,Hi.
205295,L312305,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Hi.
205296,L312282,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Thanks for dropping around.
205297,L312281,u6054,m402,MARY,Have fun.
205298,L312245,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Darling, you're wonderful."
205299,L312244,u6054,m402,MARY,Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
205300,L312243,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, Mary . . ."
205301,L312156,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"I'll be back in a minute, Mary."
205302,L312155,u6054,m402,MARY,"Please, let's not stop, George."
205303,L312154,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . ."
205304,L312150,u6045,m402,GEORGE,That does it  come here.
205305,L312149,u6054,m402,MARY,"After that, who cares?"
205306,L312147,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels  the oldest champagne  the richest caviar  the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!"
205307,L312146,u6054,m402,MARY,I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
205308,L312145,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary."
205309,L312135,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Mary . . .
205310,L312134,u6054,m402,MARY,George . . . George . . . George . . .
205311,L312100,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you."
205312,L312099,u6054,m402,MARY,"Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?"
205313,L312098,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, of course I like her. She's a peach."
205314,L312097,u6054,m402,MARY,Don't you like her?
205315,L312096,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right."
205316,L312094,u6054,m402,MARY,Thank you.
205317,L312093,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here."
205318,L312092,u6054,m402,MARY,"Well, then, sit down."
205319,L312091,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"No, I don't want to be rude."
205320,L312090,u6054,m402,MARY,Would you rather leave?
205321,L312089,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here."
205322,L312087,u6054,m402,MARY,"Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick."
205323,L312086,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them."
205324,L312085,u6054,m402,MARY,Do you like it?
205325,L312084,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Where'd you get that dress?
205326,L312083,u6054,m402,MARY,Tuesday.
205327,L312082,u6045,m402,GEORGE,When did you get back?
205328,L312081,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here."
205329,L312080,u6054,m402,MARY,"Well, are you coming in or aren't you?"
205330,L312077,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
205331,L312076,u6054,m402,MARY,Didn't you tell her?
205332,L312075,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?"
205333,L312074,u6054,m402,MARY,About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
205334,L312073,u6045,m402,GEORGE,About what?
205335,L312072,u6054,m402,MARY,Have you made up your mind?
205336,L312071,u6045,m402,GEORGE,How's that?
205337,L312070,u6054,m402,MARY,"Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?"
205338,L312069,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by."
205339,L311938,u6054,m402,MARY,I'm going to scream!
205340,L311937,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too."
205341,L311934,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
205342,L311933,u6054,m402,MARY,Ouch!
205343,L311922,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?"
205344,L311921,u6054,m402,MARY,I'll take it. And then what?
205345,L311920,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . ."
205346,L311919,u6054,m402,MARY,If I told you it might not come true.
205347,L311918,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Come on, tell me."
205348,L311917,u6054,m402,MARY,"Oh, no."
205349,L311915,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . ."
205350,L311914,u6054,m402,MARY,"What'd you wish, George?"
205351,L311913,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
205352,L311912,u6054,m402,MARY,Uh-huh.
205353,L311911,u6045,m402,GEORGE,In that place?
205354,L311910,u6054,m402,MARY,"Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it."
205355,L311908,u6054,m402,MARY,"Oh, no, don't. I love that old house."
205356,L311907,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house."
205357,L311906,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Ummmmm . . .
205358,L311905,u6054,m402,MARY,You may kiss my hand.
205359,L311904,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Your . . . your caboose, my lady."
205360,L311900,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on."
205361,L311899,u6054,m402,MARY,Too young or too old?
205362,L311898,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen."
205363,L311897,u6054,m402,MARY,Eighteen.
205364,L311896,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
205365,L311895,u6054,m402,MARY,"Well, why don't you say it?"
205366,L311894,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town."
205367,L311893,u6054,m402,MARY,Do I look as funny as you do?
205368,L311891,u6054,m402,MARY,Beautiful.
205369,L311890,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Hot dog! Just like an organ.
205370,L311886,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Okay  what can we lose?
205371,L311885,u6054,m402,MARY,Neither am I.
205372,L311884,u6045,m402,GEORGE,I'm not very good at this.
205373,L311882,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
205374,L311881,u6054,m402,MARY,Uh-huh.
205375,L311880,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Me?
205376,L311879,u6054,m402,MARY,You've passed me on the street almost every day.
205377,L311878,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, I don't."
205378,L311877,u6054,m402,MARY,Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
205379,L311876,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"Well, hello."
205380,L311666,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
205381,L311665,u6054,m402,MARY,A new magazine! I never saw it before.
205382,L311664,u6045,m402,GEORGE,"You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here  from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!"
205383,L311663,u6054,m402,MARY,I don't like coconuts.
205384,L311662,u6045,m402,GEORGE,With coconuts?
205385,L311661,u6054,m402,MARY,I'll take chocolate.
205386,L311660,u6045,m402,GEORGE,Made up your mind yet?
205387,L311807,u6047,m402,HARRY,"Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?"
205388,L311806,u6055,m402,MOTHER,Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
205389,L311793,u6055,m402,MOTHER,"Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland."
205390,L311792,u6047,m402,HARRY,"Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen."
205391,L311791,u6055,m402,MOTHER,What plates?
205392,L311790,u6047,m402,HARRY,"Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things."
205393,L311785,u6047,m402,HARRY,I don't care. It's George's tux.
205394,L311784,u6055,m402,MOTHER,"Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you."
205395,L311783,u6047,m402,HARRY,I've eaten.
205396,L311782,u6055,m402,MOTHER,"Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner."
205397,L312386,u6063,m402,UNCLE BILLY,"Hmm? Well, I . . ."

205445,L320880,u6079,m403,MIKE,I was counting on hours.
205446,L320879,u6066,m403,ANDY,Putz -- that won't be for hours.
205447,L320876,u6066,m403,ANDY,It's not going to be easy.
205448,L320875,u6079,m403,MIKE,We better go back in.
205449,L320874,u6066,m403,ANDY,Your dad must be really pissed.
205450,L320863,u6079,m403,MIKE,Yee-hah!
205451,L320862,u6066,m403,ANDY,Turkeys!  Eat wind!
205452,L320732,u6066,m403,ANDY,"Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you."
205453,L320731,u6079,m403,MIKE,Shut up.
205454,L320730,u6066,m403,ANDY,I could give you a dozen good reasons.
205455,L320729,u6079,m403,MIKE,Why not?
205456,L320711,u6066,m403,ANDY,Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
205457,L320710,u6079,m403,MIKE,Yeah.
205458,L320709,u6066,m403,ANDY,"If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?"
205459,L320354,u6079,m403,MIKE,They're moving pretty fast.
205460,L320353,u6066,m403,ANDY,Maybe by now they are.
205461,L320199,u6079,m403,MIKE,I hope that's the cousin.
205462,L320198,u6066,m403,ANDY,Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
205463,L320099,u6066,m403,ANDY,Good.  It's terrible.
205464,L320098,u6079,m403,MIKE,No.
205465,L320097,u6066,m403,ANDY,Is she responsible for the punch?
205466,L320096,u6079,m403,MIKE,"Yeah, it's her job."
205467,L321090,u6066,m403,ANDY,We're hung up on something.
205468,L321089,u6069,m403,BROOKE,What is it?
205469,L320348,u6069,m403,BROOKE,Too hot in the lighthouse?
205470,L320347,u6066,m403,ANDY,Why'd they decide to move?
205471,L320334,u6066,m403,ANDY,"No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic."
205472,L320333,u6069,m403,BROOKE,The lighthouse?
205473,L320201,u6066,m403,ANDY,"Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky."
205474,L320200,u6069,m403,BROOKE,Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
205475,L320194,u6066,m403,ANDY,Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
205476,L320193,u6069,m403,BROOKE,Shells and lobsters and stuff?
205477,L320192,u6066,m403,ANDY,"Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean."
205478,L320095,u6066,m403,ANDY,What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
205479,L320094,u6069,m403,BROOKE,That's awful.
205480,L320093,u6066,m403,ANDY,"They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups."
205481,L321088,u6066,m403,ANDY,The Shark.
205482,L321087,u6078,m403,LUCY,But the island!
205483,L321083,u6066,m403,ANDY,"Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!"
205484,L321082,u6078,m403,LUCY,But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
205485,L321030,u6066,m403,ANDY,"We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?"
205486,L321029,u6078,m403,LUCY,"Listen to Andy, Sean."
205487,L321028,u6066,m403,ANDY,"Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?"
205488,L320332,u6066,m403,ANDY,"Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse."
205489,L320331,u6078,m403,LUCY,Where're we going?
205490,L321078,u6077,m403,LARRY,"What the hell, we're steering for it."
205491,L321077,u6066,m403,ANDY,I don't know.
205492,L321033,u6066,m403,ANDY,Sean!  Catch it!
205493,L321032,u6077,m403,LARRY,Throw it.
205494,L320995,u6066,m403,ANDY,There's a shark....
205495,L320994,u6077,m403,LARRY,"As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor...."
205496,L320855,u6066,m403,ANDY,You're betting what you already got.
205497,L320854,u6077,m403,LARRY,Loser sails home alone.
205498,L320789,u6066,m403,ANDY,Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
205499,L320788,u6077,m403,LARRY,Coming up!  Give way!
205500,L320210,u6077,m403,LARRY,We'll take your supercargo.
205501,L320209,u6066,m403,ANDY,We're carrying weight.
205502,L321103,u6067,m403,BOB,Can you get us a line?
205503,L321102,u6077,m403,LARRY,We're hung up here.  Snagged.
205504,L321021,u6067,m403,BOB,The rope!  The rope!
205505,L321020,u6077,m403,LARRY,Sean!   Catch the rope!
205506,L320987,u6067,m403,BOB,Over here!
205507,L320986,u6077,m403,LARRY,Hey!
205508,L320983,u6067,m403,BOB,Anyone got another set of sails?
205509,L320982,u6077,m403,LARRY,How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
205510,L320787,u6077,m403,LARRY,You bet.  Hang on....
205511,L320786,u6067,m403,BOB,You coming up on him?
205512,L320749,u6077,m403,LARRY,Want to swim home?
205513,L320748,u6067,m403,BOB,Want to talk about it?
205514,L320747,u6077,m403,LARRY,"Let's just go sailing, okay?"
205515,L320746,u6067,m403,BOB,I thought you said she was going with us?
205516,L320208,u6067,m403,BOB,"Gangway, Turkies!"
205517,L320207,u6077,m403,LARRY,Coming up!
205518,L320904,u6068,m403,BRODY,I need a hand here....
205519,L320903,u6089,m403,TINA,It's still there!
205520,L320902,u6068,m403,BRODY,What is it?  What's there?
205521,L320901,u6089,m403,TINA,No!  It's still there!
205522,L320900,u6068,m403,BRODY,"It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---"
205523,L320899,u6089,m403,TINA,N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
205524,L320898,u6068,m403,BRODY,Tina!
205525,L320277,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Oh, yeah.  Sure."
205526,L320276,u6089,m403,TINA,Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
205527,L320922,u6068,m403,BRODY,Got it.
205528,L320921,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
205529,L320920,u6068,m403,BRODY,Never mind that shit.  Just point.
205530,L320919,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast...."
205531,L320913,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Hey -- you can't do that.
205532,L320912,u6068,m403,BRODY,I'm going out there.
205533,L320830,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there."
205534,L320829,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,You're too close.  Back off.
205535,L320826,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Please.  It's my job.
205536,L320825,u6068,m403,BRODY,Untie that rope.
205537,L320824,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
205538,L320823,u6068,m403,BRODY,Mike's out there.
205539,L320820,u6068,m403,BRODY,You can't stop me.
205540,L320819,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,I can't let you take her out.
205541,L320815,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight...."
205542,L320814,u6068,m403,BRODY,How long ago?
205543,L320469,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Right.
205544,L320468,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone."
205545,L320467,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?"
205546,L320466,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"Nine-thirty, ten maybe."
205547,L320465,u6068,m403,BRODY,The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
205548,L320464,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me."
205549,L320463,u6068,m403,BRODY,Not the drugstore!
205550,L320462,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,I know just where to go.
205551,L320461,u6068,m403,BRODY,You got it.
205552,L320460,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"If there is, develop it!"
205553,L320459,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it...."
205554,L320458,u6068,m403,BRODY,"That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up, did you look inside it?"
205555,L320457,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,What camera?
205556,L320456,u6068,m403,BRODY,What about that camera?
205557,L320455,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Oh.
205558,L320454,u6068,m403,BRODY,The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
205559,L320453,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Positive I.D.?
205560,L320452,u6068,m403,BRODY,"You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess."
205561,L320451,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
205562,L320450,u6068,m403,BRODY,In here.
205563,L320449,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Chief?
205564,L320402,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Could you just keep that crowd back, please?"
205565,L320401,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,We got a helluva tide this month.
205566,L320244,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation."
205567,L320243,u6068,m403,BRODY,"If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel."
205568,L320242,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island."
205569,L320241,u6068,m403,BRODY,Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
205570,L320240,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
205571,L320239,u6068,m403,BRODY,"I just made it up.  It means, ""Get me out of there.""  What the hell's that?"
205572,L320238,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,I never heard of a 908.
205573,L320237,u6068,m403,BRODY,Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
205574,L320236,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Chief....
205575,L320174,u6068,m403,BRODY,Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
205576,L320173,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Happy to do it.
205577,L320172,u6068,m403,BRODY,On your own time?
205578,L320164,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"Till noon.  This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty."
205579,L320163,u6068,m403,BRODY,Aren't you off-duty?
205580,L320162,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Good morning!
205581,L321064,u6068,m403,BRODY,Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
205582,L321063,u6079,m403,MIKE,"Dad, I'm sorry...."
205583,L321058,u6068,m403,BRODY,What?
205584,L321057,u6079,m403,MIKE,Sean's still out there.
205585,L321056,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?"
205586,L321055,u6068,m403,BRODY,At least you're safe.  What about the others?
205587,L321054,u6079,m403,MIKE,"I passed out, but I'm okay."
205588,L321051,u6068,m403,BRODY,It's okay.  What happened?
205589,L321050,u6079,m403,MIKE,Pop.  I'm sorry.
205590,L321049,u6068,m403,BRODY,Mike?  Is that you?
205591,L320499,u6068,m403,BRODY,"No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts."
205592,L320498,u6079,m403,MIKE,"Hey, come on...."
205593,L320497,u6068,m403,BRODY,Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
205594,L320496,u6079,m403,MIKE,I kind of had plans....
205595,L320495,u6068,m403,BRODY,I got something for you to do tomorrow.
205596,L320491,u6068,m403,BRODY,You want to come here a minute?
205597,L320490,u6079,m403,MIKE,Yeah?
205598,L320489,u6068,m403,BRODY,Michael.
205599,L320475,u6068,m403,BRODY,Not till next year.
205600,L320474,u6079,m403,MIKE,Is Hooper coming to dinner?
205601,L320404,u6068,m403,BRODY,You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
205602,L320403,u6079,m403,MIKE,Pop....
205603,L320379,u6068,m403,BRODY,You heard me.
205604,L320378,u6079,m403,MIKE,"Oh, c'mon."
205605,L320377,u6068,m403,BRODY,You stay here a minute.
205606,L320324,u6079,m403,MIKE,"Okay, okay."
205607,L320323,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble."
205608,L320322,u6079,m403,MIKE,I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
205609,L320321,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Look, humor the old man -- just be careful."
205610,L320320,u6079,m403,MIKE,Because.
205611,L320319,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?"
205612,L320318,u6079,m403,MIKE,Bartending?  I'm 17.
205613,L320317,u6068,m403,BRODY,What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
205614,L320316,u6079,m403,MIKE,I'm going.
205615,L320305,u6068,m403,BRODY,You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
205616,L320304,u6079,m403,MIKE,Do I have to?
205617,L320303,u6068,m403,BRODY,"You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school."
205618,L320302,u6079,m403,MIKE,What else is there to do?
205619,L320301,u6068,m403,BRODY,Every day?
205620,L320300,u6079,m403,MIKE,"I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing."
205621,L320178,u6068,m403,BRODY,Sailing?
205622,L320177,u6079,m403,MIKE,No place special.  Just hanging out.
205623,L320176,u6068,m403,BRODY,Where to?
205624,L320585,u6083,m403,PHIL,"Okay, okay -- stand over there...."
205625,L320584,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around."
205626,L320583,u6083,m403,PHIL,Let's see -- you got a minute?
205627,L320582,u6068,m403,BRODY,What else you got?
205628,L320581,u6083,m403,PHIL,"Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though...."
205629,L320579,u6083,m403,PHIL,"Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing.  You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up.  Here's a test I did...."
205630,L320578,u6068,m403,BRODY,Did you get any pictures?
205631,L320577,u6083,m403,PHIL,"Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he...."
205632,L320576,u6068,m403,BRODY,You said something about a camera.
205633,L320575,u6083,m403,PHIL,"I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure...."
205634,L320616,u6068,m403,BRODY,"It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!"
205635,L320615,u6082,m403,PETERSON,What's that supposed to mean?
205636,L320614,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way."
205637,L320613,u6082,m403,PETERSON,You don't make enough.
205638,L320612,u6068,m403,BRODY,Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
205639,L320611,u6082,m403,PETERSON,"Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us."
205640,L320610,u6068,m403,BRODY,There is nothing to discuss.
205641,L320607,u6068,m403,BRODY,My ass!
205642,L320606,u6082,m403,PETERSON,What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.
205643,L320602,u6068,m403,BRODY,You're damn right that's what it is.
205644,L320601,u6082,m403,PETERSON,Is that what it is?
205645,L320600,u6068,m403,BRODY,"What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills."
205646,L320597,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along."
205647,L320596,u6082,m403,PETERSON,It came up during the meeting.
205648,L320593,u6068,m403,BRODY,Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
205649,L320592,u6082,m403,PETERSON,Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
205650,L320155,u6082,m403,PETERSON,"Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?"
205651,L320154,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Too late, it's written."
205652,L320153,u6082,m403,PETERSON,Wait a minute....
205653,L320125,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear."
205654,L320124,u6082,m403,PETERSON,May I have this dance?
205655,L320086,u6068,m403,BRODY,"All of us thank you, okay?"
205656,L320085,u6082,m403,PETERSON,"Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town."
205657,L320084,u6068,m403,BRODY,Me neither.
205658,L320083,u6082,m403,PETERSON,Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
205659,L320411,u6073,m403,ELKINS,Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
205660,L320410,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy...."
205661,L320409,u6073,m403,ELKINS,"Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite."
205662,L320408,u6068,m403,BRODY,Can't you tell?
205663,L320407,u6073,m403,ELKINS,"It's either a Great White, or another killer whale."
205664,L320400,u6073,m403,ELKINS,"Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further."
205665,L320399,u6068,m403,BRODY,So there's one around here.
205666,L320398,u6073,m403,ELKINS,"Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration."
205667,L320397,u6068,m403,BRODY,Sound?
205668,L320396,u6073,m403,ELKINS,And sound.
205669,L320395,u6068,m403,BRODY,"That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around...."
205670,L320394,u6073,m403,ELKINS,Probably.
205671,L320393,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this."
205672,L320392,u6073,m403,ELKINS,"This is a mammal, not a fish."
205673,L320391,u6068,m403,BRODY,Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
205674,L320390,u6073,m403,ELKINS,What makes you think there might be?
205675,L320389,u6068,m403,BRODY,Is there one in these waters?
205676,L320388,u6073,m403,ELKINS,"Okay, so that's it."
205677,L320387,u6068,m403,BRODY,That's it.
205678,L320386,u6073,m403,ELKINS,Carcharadon Carcharias.
205679,L320385,u6068,m403,BRODY,I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
205680,L320384,u6073,m403,ELKINS,Do you?
205681,L320383,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Look, I know a little bit about sharks."
205682,L320382,u6073,m403,ELKINS,Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
205683,L320374,u6073,m403,ELKINS,"You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?"
205684,L320373,u6068,m403,BRODY,"But that's what we're here to find out, right?"
205685,L320372,u6073,m403,ELKINS,"We don't know that, do we?"
205686,L320371,u6068,m403,BRODY,"The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?"
205687,L320370,u6073,m403,ELKINS,What shark?
205688,L320369,u6068,m403,BRODY,The Shark's mouth.
205689,L320368,u6073,m403,ELKINS,The whale's mouth?
205690,L320367,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?"
205691,L320366,u6073,m403,ELKINS,The what?
205692,L320365,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Come on, let's check the bite radius."
205693,L320364,u6073,m403,ELKINS,"Length, 22 feet, 8 inches."
205694,L320363,u6073,m403,ELKINS,First things first.
205695,L320362,u6068,m403,BRODY,Look at that:
205696,L320358,u6073,m403,ELKINS,"After we've looked, we'll talk."
205697,L320357,u6068,m403,BRODY,"As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big."
205698,L320915,u6068,m403,BRODY,Mike's out there.
205699,L320914,u6074,m403,ELLEN,What is it?  What's the matter?
205700,L320817,u6068,m403,BRODY,Going out.
205701,L320816,u6074,m403,ELLEN,What're you doing?
205702,L320800,u6068,m403,BRODY,Just one minute....
205703,L320799,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
205704,L320703,u6068,m403,BRODY,Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
205705,L320702,u6074,m403,ELLEN,I'll give notice.
205706,L320701,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss."
205707,L320700,u6074,m403,ELLEN,What're you going to do today?
205708,L320647,u6068,m403,BRODY,"I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm...."
205709,L320646,u6074,m403,ELLEN,I know you did....
205710,L320645,u6068,m403,BRODY,Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
205711,L320644,u6074,m403,ELLEN,"They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island...."
205712,L320643,u6068,m403,BRODY,"...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass...."
205713,L320642,u6074,m403,ELLEN,"Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they...."
205714,L320641,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me...."
205715,L320640,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
205716,L320639,u6068,m403,BRODY,"No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous."
205717,L320638,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Because of today?  The beach?
205718,L320637,u6068,m403,BRODY,Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
205719,L320636,u6074,m403,ELLEN,That you were fired.
205720,L320635,u6068,m403,BRODY,What'd I say?
205721,L320634,u6074,m403,ELLEN,What?
205722,L320633,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all."
205723,L320632,u6074,m403,ELLEN,What's wrong?
205724,L320630,u6068,m403,BRODY,That's great too.  Gorgeous.
205725,L320629,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Sean's asleep.
205726,L320628,u6068,m403,BRODY,That's great.
205727,L320627,u6074,m403,ELLEN,"Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through."
205728,L320509,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!"
205729,L320508,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Are you going to be able to sleep?
205730,L320507,u6068,m403,BRODY,The goddamn smell is always the same.
205731,L320506,u6074,m403,ELLEN,"It was bad, wasn't it."
205732,L320505,u6068,m403,BRODY,"In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?"
205733,L320504,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Do you?
205734,L320503,u6068,m403,BRODY,I know what you're going to say.
205735,L320501,u6068,m403,BRODY,"He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night."
205736,L320500,u6074,m403,ELLEN,All summer?
205737,L320488,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Terrific.
205738,L320487,u6068,m403,BRODY,No.
205739,L320486,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Oh.  Want to talk about it?
205740,L320485,u6068,m403,BRODY,Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
205741,L320484,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
205742,L320483,u6068,m403,BRODY,That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
205743,L320482,u6074,m403,ELLEN,"Nothing, huh?"
205744,L320481,u6068,m403,BRODY,Nothing.
205745,L320480,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Careful.  What's wrong?
205746,L320479,u6068,m403,BRODY,Oww!
205747,L320478,u6068,m403,BRODY,Santos' place.
205748,L320477,u6074,m403,ELLEN,"Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?"
205749,L320476,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Oh, hi -- How was dinner?"
205750,L320473,u6068,m403,BRODY,Damn.
205751,L320472,u6074,m403,ELLEN,"Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring."
205752,L320471,u6068,m403,BRODY,For me?
205753,L320470,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Thank you.  I'll tell him.
205754,L320315,u6074,m403,ELLEN,It's an island.  Got to run.
205755,L320314,u6068,m403,BRODY,Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
205756,L320313,u6074,m403,ELLEN,One what?  Ah-ha!
205757,L320312,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one."
205758,L320311,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
205759,L320307,u6068,m403,BRODY,In the den.
205760,L320306,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Where's my day book?
205761,L320299,u6068,m403,BRODY,What're you guys doing today?
205762,L320298,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Eat Cheerios.
205763,L320294,u6074,m403,ELLEN,So's a donut.
205764,L320293,u6068,m403,BRODY,It's good with coffee.
205765,L320292,u6074,m403,ELLEN,You have to smoke so early in the morning?
205766,L320152,u6068,m403,BRODY,Better yet.
205767,L320151,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Hey!  That's my boss!
205768,L320147,u6074,m403,ELLEN,As far as the office.
205769,L320146,u6068,m403,BRODY,Need a ride?
205770,L320145,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Mrs. Silvera.
205771,L320144,u6068,m403,BRODY,Mrs. Silvera?
205772,L320139,u6068,m403,BRODY,Good.
205773,L320138,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Door's locked.
205774,L320137,u6068,m403,BRODY,Sean's awake.
205775,L320136,u6074,m403,ELLEN,MMMmmmorning....
205776,L320135,u6068,m403,BRODY,Mmmm.
205777,L320133,u6068,m403,BRODY,Home it is.
205778,L320132,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Let's get the kid home.
205779,L320131,u6068,m403,BRODY,Right.
205780,L320130,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Fooling around?
205781,L320129,u6068,m403,BRODY,Listen -- what are you doing later?
205782,L320128,u6068,m403,BRODY,"I did, I did."
205783,L320127,u6074,m403,ELLEN,And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
205784,L320126,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?"
205785,L320123,u6068,m403,BRODY,Because they're playing our song.
205786,L320122,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Why?
205787,L320121,u6068,m403,BRODY,Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
205788,L320078,u6074,m403,ELLEN,My boss and your boss.  Sure.
205789,L320077,u6068,m403,BRODY,Do I have to talk to those two?
205790,L320062,u6074,m403,ELLEN,I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
205791,L320061,u6068,m403,BRODY,Late.
205792,L320060,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Where the hell were you?
205793,L320618,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Go ahead, whatever it's worth."
205794,L320617,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?"
205795,L320605,u6068,m403,BRODY,"What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!"
205796,L320604,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Martin, it could be anything."
205797,L320591,u6068,m403,BRODY,What?
205798,L320590,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
205799,L320589,u6068,m403,BRODY,Perfect.  Look at this ---
205800,L320588,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Martin, this is kind of an official meeting"
205801,L320587,u6068,m403,BRODY,Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
205802,L320442,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Don't push it this time.  If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that."
205803,L320441,u6068,m403,BRODY,Someone has to do something.
205804,L320440,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything."
205805,L320439,u6068,m403,BRODY,Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
205806,L320438,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,Bullshit.
205807,L320437,u6068,m403,BRODY,Maybe they are!
205808,L320436,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
205809,L320435,u6068,m403,BRODY,Two of them are still missing!
205810,L320434,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident."
205811,L320433,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers...."
205812,L320432,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke."
205813,L320431,u6068,m403,BRODY,It's still a good idea.
205814,L320430,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one."
205815,L320429,u6068,m403,BRODY,"I know, I know...."
205816,L320428,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know."
205817,L320427,u6068,m403,BRODY,We have to do something.
205818,L320426,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money."
205819,L320425,u6068,m403,BRODY,"I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?"
205820,L320424,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic."
205821,L320423,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator...."
205822,L320422,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,Are you serious?
205823,L320421,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one."
205824,L320420,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,We're alone.
205825,L320419,u6068,m403,BRODY,"We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone."
205826,L320418,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
205827,L320081,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?"
205828,L320080,u6068,m403,BRODY,Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
205829,L320079,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought."
205830,L321019,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
205831,L321018,u6068,m403,BRODY,When?
205832,L321017,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,That's what he said.
205833,L321016,u6068,m403,BRODY,Did you say Cable Junction?
205834,L321015,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,"Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself."
205835,L321014,u6068,m403,BRODY,Yeah?  Then what?
205836,L321013,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
205837,L321012,u6068,m403,BRODY,Did he raise the Kids?
205838,L321011,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
205839,L321010,u6068,m403,BRODY,Where the hell is Air One?
205840,L321009,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
205841,L321008,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?"
205842,L320845,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,"Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out."
205843,L320844,u6068,m403,BRODY,"If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!"
205844,L320843,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,"10-4,   soon as I can raise him."
205845,L320842,u6068,m403,BRODY,"That's it.  Just do it, all right?"
205846,L320841,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,That's it?
205847,L320840,u6068,m403,BRODY,There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
205848,L320839,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,What for?
205849,L320838,u6068,m403,BRODY,"Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now."
205850,L320837,u6081,m403,PATROL VOICE,"10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel."
205851,L320836,u6068,m403,BRODY,Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
205852,L321137,u6068,m403,BRODY,Sure they did....
205853,L321136,u6086,m403,SEAN,They made me go with them.
205854,L321113,u6068,m403,BRODY,"I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay...."
205855,L321112,u6086,m403,SEAN,Dad!  Dad!
205856,L321111,u6068,m403,BRODY,Hang on!
205857,L320493,u6068,m403,BRODY,Hiya yourself.
205858,L320492,u6086,m403,SEAN,Hi Dad.
205859,L320326,u6068,m403,BRODY,"You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?"
205860,L320325,u6086,m403,SEAN,Can I go with you today?
205861,L320149,u6086,m403,SEAN,What's daddy doing?
205862,L320148,u6068,m403,BRODY,Some people.
205863,L320089,u6068,m403,BRODY,"No.  Find your brother, okay?"
205864,L320088,u6086,m403,SEAN,Can I go swimming?
205865,L320072,u6068,m403,BRODY,Shouldn't he be at home?
205866,L320071,u6086,m403,SEAN,"Mom, Michael won't talk to me."
205867,L321071,u6069,m403,BROOKE,"It's all right, we're okay."
205868,L321070,u6076,m403,JACKIE,We're going to die.
205869,L321025,u6069,m403,BROOKE,Shh.  Shhh....
205870,L321024,u6076,m403,JACKIE,It killed her.  It ate her.
205871,L320964,u6069,m403,BROOKE,Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
205872,L320963,u6076,m403,JACKIE,What's wrong?
205873,L320352,u6076,m403,JACKIE,"Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?"
205874,L320351,u6069,m403,BROOKE,"I told you, remember?"
205875,L320341,u6069,m403,BROOKE,"You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him."
205876,L320340,u6076,m403,JACKIE,Now I really want to see it.
205877,L320339,u6069,m403,BROOKE,The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
205878,L320213,u6076,m403,JACKIE,I've never been supercargo.
205879,L320212,u6069,m403,BROOKE,That's you.
205880,L320211,u6076,m403,JACKIE,Is that me?
205881,L320724,u6079,m403,MIKE,Maybe.
205882,L320723,u6069,m403,BROOKE,Mike!  Are you going out?
205883,L320688,u6079,m403,MIKE,Great.
205884,L320687,u6069,m403,BROOKE,She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
205885,L320187,u6079,m403,MIKE,"I will, I will."
205886,L320186,u6069,m403,BROOKE,I want you to meet my cousin.
205887,L320185,u6079,m403,MIKE,Waiting for Andy.
205888,L320184,u6069,m403,BROOKE,"You're not going out right away, are you?"
205889,L320101,u6079,m403,MIKE,Great.
205890,L320100,u6069,m403,BROOKE,My cousin will be here tomorrow.
205891,L320092,u6079,m403,MIKE,I'm not crazy about blind dates.
205892,L320091,u6069,m403,BROOKE,Seventeen.  She's a senior.
205893,L320090,u6079,m403,MIKE,How old is your cousin?
205894,L320264,u6070,m403,DIANE,"Okay, okay, coming...."

205901,L320250,u6070,m403,DIANE,Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
205902,L320249,u6087,m403,TERRY,Did you ever see a dolphin?
205903,L320655,u6088,m403,TIMMY,"Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner."
205904,L320654,u6071,m403,DOUG,That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
205905,L320120,u6071,m403,DOUG,None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
205906,L320119,u6088,m403,TIMMY,No class.
205907,L320115,u6071,m403,DOUG,I know.
205908,L320114,u6088,m403,TIMMY,That's a crock of shit.
205909,L320113,u6071,m403,DOUG,Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
205910,L320112,u6088,m403,TIMMY,You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
205911,L320111,u6071,m403,DOUG,Tina Wilcox.
205912,L320110,u6088,m403,TIMMY,Who'd you ask?
205913,L320109,u6071,m403,DOUG,Me neither.
205914,L320108,u6088,m403,TIMMY,Nope.
205915,L320107,u6071,m403,DOUG,Get a dance yet?
205916,L321081,u6071,m403,DOUG,"Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way...."
205917,L321080,u6077,m403,LARRY,What's that mean?

205926,L320775,u6072,m403,ED,You got it.
205927,L320774,u6089,m403,TINA,"That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them."

205929,L320772,u6089,m403,TINA,Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
205930,L320771,u6072,m403,ED,Mmmmmm.
205931,L320770,u6089,m403,TINA,And second?
205932,L320769,u6072,m403,ED,"But first, a little juice...."
205933,L320768,u6072,m403,ED,I dunno.  We'll think of something.
205934,L320767,u6089,m403,TINA,What're we going to do in the mean time?
205935,L320766,u6072,m403,ED,They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
205936,L320765,u6089,m403,TINA,What about the others?
205937,L320763,u6089,m403,TINA,It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
205938,L320762,u6072,m403,ED,The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
205939,L320761,u6089,m403,TINA,What about sailing?
205940,L320760,u6072,m403,ED,Just like this.
205941,L320759,u6089,m403,TINA,"You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?"

205955,L320822,u6074,m403,ELLEN,I'm going.

205957,L320813,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Yep.  Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
205958,L320812,u6074,m403,ELLEN,Mike?  Our Mike?
205959,L320811,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang."

205961,L320809,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"Right after, the Kids went out?"
205962,L320291,u6085,m403,RED,Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
205963,L320290,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
205964,L320289,u6085,m403,RED,It comes here from Cable Junction.

205969,L320282,u6085,m403,RED,About damn time.
205970,L320280,u6085,m403,RED,"I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored."
205971,L320279,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Until we find something.
205972,L320278,u6085,m403,RED,How much longer?
205973,L320219,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,Happens every season -- someone takes off.  Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
205974,L320218,u6085,m403,RED,Figure they split?
205975,L320217,u6075,m403,HENDRICKS,"Rich or poor, it's nice to have money."
205976,L320878,u6079,m403,MIKE,"We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide."
205977,L320877,u6076,m403,JACKIE,What's wrong?
205978,L320857,u6076,m403,JACKIE,I love it.
205979,L320856,u6079,m403,MIKE,I don't care.
205980,L320853,u6079,m403,MIKE,Name it.
205981,L320852,u6076,m403,JACKIE,That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
205982,L320726,u6079,m403,MIKE,I can go out if I want to.
205983,L320725,u6076,m403,JACKIE,I thought you were grounded.
205984,L320685,u6076,m403,JACKIE,"Good.  I'll be on the dock at eight.  Eight o'clock, everybody!"
205985,L320684,u6079,m403,MIKE,No.
205986,L320683,u6076,m403,JACKIE,You do everything your parents tell you?
205987,L320682,u6079,m403,MIKE,That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
205988,L320681,u6076,m403,JACKIE,"No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so."
205989,L320680,u6079,m403,MIKE,Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
205990,L320679,u6076,m403,JACKIE,"It'll be fun, come on!"
205991,L320678,u6079,m403,MIKE,I'm not sure I can.
205992,L320677,u6076,m403,JACKIE,I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
205993,L320381,u6079,m403,MIKE,I'll be right there.  Wait up.
205994,L320380,u6076,m403,JACKIE,We'll be over by the lighthouse.
205995,L320350,u6076,m403,JACKIE,Is there something I don't know about?
205996,L320349,u6079,m403,MIKE,Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
205997,L320338,u6076,m403,JACKIE,Great.  I got some wine.
205998,L320337,u6079,m403,MIKE,"It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know...."
205999,L320336,u6076,m403,JACKIE,What's the lighthouse?
206000,L321023,u6078,m403,LUCY,"Sean, baby, please...."
206001,L321022,u6080,m403,PATRICK,He's got to help or it won't work.
206002,L320883,u6080,m403,PATRICK,Might as well.
206003,L320882,u6078,m403,LUCY,Heading back?
206004,L320872,u6078,m403,LUCY,"Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch."
206005,L320871,u6080,m403,PATRICK,Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
206006,L320870,u6078,m403,LUCY,What about me?
206007,L320869,u6080,m403,PATRICK,"If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!"
206008,L320868,u6078,m403,LUCY,Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
206009,L320777,u6080,m403,PATRICK,Coming about....
206010,L320776,u6078,m403,LUCY,Faster!  Faster!
206011,L320885,u6078,m403,LUCY,"Coming about, then."
206012,L320884,u6084,m403,POLO,They're turning around.
206013,L320666,u6084,m403,POLO,Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
206014,L320665,u6078,m403,LUCY,Who wouldn't.
206015,L320069,u6084,m403,POLO,You going with Patrick?
206016,L320068,u6078,m403,LUCY,Not tonight.
206017,L320067,u6084,m403,POLO,When are we going out?  You and me?
206018,L320066,u6078,m403,LUCY,I don't think she's such hot stuff.
206019,L320720,u6079,m403,MIKE,Would you take him?
206020,L320719,u6086,m403,SEAN,Yeah.
206021,L320713,u6086,m403,SEAN,"I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?"
206022,L320712,u6079,m403,MIKE,"Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home."
206023,L320698,u6079,m403,MIKE,"Okay, okay.  Close your door."
206024,L320697,u6086,m403,SEAN,Michael....
206025,L320696,u6079,m403,MIKE,Quiet!  Shhh!
206026,L320695,u6086,m403,SEAN,I want to go with you!
206027,L320694,u6079,m403,MIKE,No.
206028,L320693,u6086,m403,SEAN,Take me.
206029,L320692,u6079,m403,MIKE,Maybe.
206030,L320691,u6086,m403,SEAN,You're going sailing.
206031,L320690,u6079,m403,MIKE,Yeah.
206032,L320689,u6086,m403,SEAN,You're going out.
206033,L320297,u6086,m403,SEAN,You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
206034,L320296,u6079,m403,MIKE,Eat Cheerios.
206035,L320295,u6086,m403,SEAN,I want Fruit Loops!
206036,L320196,u6079,m403,MIKE,"Yeah.  Go on, beat it."
206037,L320195,u6086,m403,SEAN,Do I have to play with the little kids?
206038,L320191,u6079,m403,MIKE,How was dive class?
206039,L320190,u6086,m403,SEAN,You always go with Andy.
206040,L320189,u6079,m403,MIKE,I don't need you.  Andy's here.
206041,L320609,u6082,m403,PETERSON,"Forget it, he won't listen."
206042,L320608,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Be reasonable, please...."
206043,L320570,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences."
206044,L320569,u6082,m403,PETERSON,"So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple."
206045,L320568,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,So?  So?
206046,L320567,u6082,m403,PETERSON,"Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else."
206047,L320562,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,He thought he had a good reason.
206048,L320561,u6082,m403,PETERSON,"You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!"
206049,L320546,u6082,m403,PETERSON,What the hell is he doing?
206050,L320545,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Oh, my God...."
206051,L320534,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
206052,L320533,u6082,m403,PETERSON,How the hell do we get him down. from there?
206053,L320532,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,Wave to my son.
206054,L320527,u6082,m403,PETERSON,"Oh, shit."
206055,L320526,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,Brody's riding his tower.
206056,L320525,u6082,m403,PETERSON,I think we got a couple of live ones.
206057,L320524,u6090,m403,VAUGHN,"Len, can I see you a minute?"
206058,L320523,u6082,m403,PETERSON,"And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them."
206059,L322325,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
206060,L322324,u6091,m404,BRIAN,Don't feel bad.
206061,L322313,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
206062,L322312,u6091,m404,BRIAN,It hasn't adjusted.
206063,L322209,u6091,m404,BRIAN,"No, I'm fine, thanks."
206064,L322208,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Go on, you're tired."
206065,L322207,u6091,m404,BRIAN,I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
206066,L322206,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Why don't you take a rest, Brian?"
206067,L322193,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
206068,L322192,u6091,m404,BRIAN,We're ready for you.
206069,L322112,u6092,m404,CALVIN,And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
206070,L322111,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out."
206071,L322110,u6092,m404,CALVIN,"He's going with you, Doctor."
206072,L322109,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,With those camera lights and...
206073,L322108,u6092,m404,CALVIN,Absolutely.  Good idea.
206074,L322092,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I can get it.
206075,L322091,u6092,m404,CALVIN,It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
206076,L322090,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
206077,L322089,u6092,m404,CALVIN,"Go on, Doctor."
206078,L322510,u6098,m404,MIKE,It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
206079,L322509,u6092,m404,CALVIN,"What's your plan, Brody?"
206080,L322083,u6098,m404,MIKE,And a missing man.
206081,L322082,u6092,m404,CALVIN,What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.
206082,L322009,u6092,m404,CALVIN,"I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start."
206083,L322008,u6098,m404,MIKE,We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
206084,L322007,u6092,m404,CALVIN,"Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower."
206085,L322006,u6098,m404,MIKE,I'll need more men to look.
206086,L322003,u6092,m404,CALVIN,Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
206087,L322002,u6098,m404,MIKE,I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
206088,L321922,u6100,m404,OVERMAN,Shit.
206089,L321921,u6093,m404,HARRIS,Yeah.  Down there.
206090,L321920,u6100,m404,OVERMAN,You see the three-quarter socket?
206091,L321918,u6093,m404,HARRIS,Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
206092,L321917,u6100,m404,OVERMAN,Sure am.
206093,L321916,u6093,m404,HARRIS,You buying?
206094,L321915,u6100,m404,OVERMAN,It's Miller time!
206095,L322134,u6094,m404,IKE,"Me?  I don't know.  Twenty, thirty.  I love them, think they're the greatest."
206096,L322133,u6098,m404,MIKE,How many sharks have you killed?
206097,L322132,u6094,m404,IKE,"Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes."
206098,L322131,u6098,m404,MIKE,She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
206099,L322130,u6094,m404,IKE,"Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her."
206100,L322129,u6098,m404,MIKE,No.
206101,L322128,u6094,m404,IKE,"Aren't you suiting up, mate?"
206102,L322532,u6098,m404,MIKE,I'm  fine.
206103,L322531,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Are you okay?
206104,L322527,u6098,m404,MIKE,Only to myself.
206105,L322526,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,You don't have to prove anything.
206106,L322525,u6098,m404,MIKE,"I want that shark, Kathryn."
206107,L322524,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Michael, you don't have to go down there."
206108,L322519,u6098,m404,MIKE,It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
206109,L322518,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,But you --
206110,L322517,u6098,m404,MIKE,I am.  You're not.
206111,L322516,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Michael, you're not going down there."
206112,L322515,u6098,m404,MIKE,Me.
206113,L322514,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Who's going to do it?
206114,L322513,u6098,m404,MIKE,That's right.
206115,L322498,u6098,m404,MIKE,... Okay.
206116,L322497,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark."
206117,L322496,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right."
206118,L322495,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,How is he?
206119,L322449,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
206120,L322448,u6098,m404,MIKE,Come on!
206121,L322440,u6098,m404,MIKE,It's all controlled from the Control Room.
206122,L322439,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Somebody better get down there!
206123,L322433,u6098,m404,MIKE,You wanted to know about a cave?
206124,L322432,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
206125,L322431,u6098,m404,MIKE,What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
206126,L322423,u6098,m404,MIKE,I don't understand.
206127,L322422,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
206128,L322419,u6098,m404,MIKE,Thirty feet???
206129,L322418,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
206130,L322417,u6098,m404,MIKE,"What do you mean, we don't?"
206131,L322416,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"That's just it, Michael.  We don't!"
206132,L322415,u6098,m404,MIKE,"What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark."
206133,L322412,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
206134,L322411,u6098,m404,MIKE,So?
206135,L322410,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,It's a shark's tooth!
206136,L322409,u6098,m404,MIKE,Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
206137,L322296,u6098,m404,MIKE,"I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!"
206138,L322295,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Yes, you can."
206139,L322294,u6098,m404,MIKE,"I can't take water, Kathryn."
206140,L322293,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Come on.
206141,L322292,u6098,m404,MIKE,I have to get out of here.
206142,L322291,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Michael, take deep breaths."
206143,L322290,u6098,m404,MIKE,Hydrophobia...
206144,L322289,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Honey, what is it?"
206145,L322285,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Well, that's why you got it."
206146,L322284,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
206147,L322283,u6098,m404,MIKE,So tell Calvin.
206148,L322282,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,It's too soon to move him.
206149,L322281,u6098,m404,MIKE,... He ought to put him in here.
206150,L322280,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
206151,L322279,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!"
206152,L322278,u6098,m404,MIKE,"I don't want to see them, Kathryn."
206153,L322277,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
206154,L322276,u6098,m404,MIKE,I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
206155,L322275,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?"
206156,L322274,u6098,m404,MIKE,"No,  I'm not going through there."
206157,L322273,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Yes.  It's faster.
206158,L322272,u6098,m404,MIKE,... Mean through the tubes?
206159,L322271,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"No, we'll go through here."
206160,L322270,u6098,m404,MIKE,Sure.  Let's go.
206161,L322269,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
206162,L322268,u6098,m404,MIKE,Okay.
206163,L322267,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I need more pressure in the shark tank.
206164,L322266,u6098,m404,MIKE,What's up?
206165,L322265,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,They said you'd be here.
206166,L322251,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater."
206167,L322250,u6098,m404,MIKE,You don't.
206168,L322249,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Mmmm... you smell good.
206169,L322248,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Me, too."
206170,L322247,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Recovering nicely.
206171,L322246,u6098,m404,MIKE,How's your patient?
206172,L322245,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Finally.
206173,L322196,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Sean, that's right..."
206174,L322195,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
206175,L322194,u6098,m404,MIKE,You want me to stay?
206176,L322190,u6098,m404,MIKE,"We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water."
206177,L322189,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Sounds wonderful.
206178,L322188,u6098,m404,MIKE,"After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me."
206179,L322187,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"... Me, too."
206180,L322186,u6098,m404,MIKE,I can use a shot of what he's got.
206181,L322180,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"No, you're not."
206182,L322179,u6098,m404,MIKE,You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
206183,L322178,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,No.
206184,L322177,u6098,m404,MIKE,Change your mind?
206185,L322155,u6098,m404,MIKE,Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
206186,L322154,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,It's easier to lure sharks at night.
206187,L322153,u6098,m404,MIKE,Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
206188,L322147,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Yes?
206189,L322146,u6098,m404,MIKE,Kathryn...
206190,L322145,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Thank you.
206191,L322144,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you."
206192,L322143,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Fine piece of engineering.
206193,L322142,u6098,m404,MIKE,Bracelets.
206194,L322141,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,What's that?
206195,L322140,u6098,m404,MIKE,Here.
206196,L322139,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I got it on sale.  A real steel.
206197,L322138,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?"
206198,L322120,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac."
206199,L322119,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I know I can capture it.
206200,L322118,u6098,m404,MIKE,After what happened to us?
206201,L322117,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Yes.
206202,L322116,u6098,m404,MIKE,You're going down there again?
206203,L322081,u6098,m404,MIKE,It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
206204,L322080,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Don't think about it.  It's over.
206205,L322079,u6098,m404,MIKE,"God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?"
206206,L322078,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,How the hell did it get in here?
206207,L322076,u6098,m404,MIKE,"It's all right, baby.  We're safe..."
206208,L322075,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Michael...
206209,L322074,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I'm okay.
206210,L322073,u6098,m404,MIKE,I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
206211,L322072,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,You all right?
206212,L322071,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
206213,L322070,u6098,m404,MIKE,"You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care."
206214,L322069,u6098,m404,MIKE,"No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?"
206215,L322068,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Are you coming...?
206216,L322067,u6098,m404,MIKE,I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
206217,L322066,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I talked you into this?
206218,L322065,u6098,m404,MIKE,"What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this."
206219,L322064,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Make up your mind.
206220,L322063,u6098,m404,MIKE,And leave me down here???
206221,L322062,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Up.
206222,L322061,u6098,m404,MIKE,Where are you going?
206223,L322060,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you."
206224,L322059,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle."
206225,L322058,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Michael, the sub's dead."
206226,L322057,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying."
206227,L322056,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,That we swim.
206228,L322055,u6098,m404,MIKE,You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
206229,L322054,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
206230,L322053,u6098,m404,MIKE,"... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?"
206231,L322052,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Nothing.
206232,L322051,u6098,m404,MIKE,What's wrong?
206233,L322043,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Let's not talk about that now, okay?"
206234,L322042,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving."
206235,L322041,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Oh, yeah.  Very."
206236,L322040,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,It's romantic down here.
206237,L322037,u6098,m404,MIKE,"I know, I built it.  I've just never seen it this way."
206238,L322036,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,That's a lot of ground to cover.
206239,L322035,u6098,m404,MIKE,Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
206240,L322034,u6098,m404,MIKE,... Friggin' fish.
206241,L322033,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,They just wanted to say hello.
206242,L322032,u6098,m404,MIKE,Baby goddamn scared me to death!
206243,L322031,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Hi, baby."
206244,L322030,u6098,m404,MIKE,Damn it!
206245,L322029,u6098,m404,MIKE,Yes.
206246,L322028,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Are you scared?
206247,L322027,u6098,m404,MIKE,No.
206248,L322026,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Honey... you all right?
206249,L322023,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Just put your mask on.
206250,L322022,u6098,m404,MIKE,"That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute."
206251,L322021,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Take a deep breath and hold it.
206252,L322020,u6098,m404,MIKE,What do I do now?
206253,L322017,u6098,m404,MIKE,I don't have a choice.
206254,L322016,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Look, Michael... you don't have to come."
206255,L322015,u6098,m404,MIKE,Where's the rubber band?
206256,L322014,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
206257,L322013,u6098,m404,MIKE,They're coming with us?
206258,L321913,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Get out of here!
206259,L321912,u6098,m404,MIKE,Not enough loving.
206260,L321911,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat."
206261,L321910,u6098,m404,MIKE,Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
206262,L321909,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
206263,L321908,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?"
206264,L321907,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
206265,L321906,u6098,m404,MIKE,It's his work.
206266,L321905,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I don't like what he does.
206267,L321904,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Yeah, you really don't like him."
206268,L321903,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
206269,L321902,u6098,m404,MIKE,And what else is bothering you?
206270,L321901,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
206271,L321900,u6098,m404,MIKE,How come?
206272,L321899,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
206273,L321898,u6098,m404,MIKE,"You called, Doctor?"
206274,L321858,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Okay, bye."
206275,L321857,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Honey, I gotta go."
206276,L321856,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,My imagination isn't that good.
206277,L321855,u6098,m404,MIKE,Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
206278,L321854,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,That macho pompous English --
206279,L321839,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,See you later.
206280,L321838,u6098,m404,MIKE,Yeah.
206281,L321837,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Don't forget you have your brother.
206282,L321836,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon."
206283,L321828,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I guess.
206284,L321827,u6098,m404,MIKE,Pre-opening jitters.
206285,L321826,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,They're acting very strange suddenly.
206286,L321825,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous."
206287,L321824,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,You will.  I'll see to it.
206288,L321823,u6098,m404,MIKE,Hope I make it through both.
206289,L321822,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Till this opens, not our wedding."
206290,L321821,u6098,m404,MIKE,"What is it, 97 days?"
206291,L321820,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Well, not much longer to go."
206292,L321818,u6098,m404,MIKE,Want another one?
206293,L321817,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Thank you.
206294,L322512,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
206295,L322511,u6101,m404,PHILIP,A piece of pie on Sunday.
206296,L322501,u6101,m404,PHILIP,He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
206297,L322500,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"She, Mister Hutton."
206298,L322499,u6101,m404,PHILIP,We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
206299,L322447,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
206300,L322446,u6101,m404,PHILIP,He's big as a bloody bus!
206301,L322442,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,How'd it get in here?!
206302,L322441,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"I've heard of a White that big, in Australia..."
206303,L322425,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
206304,L322424,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die."
206305,L322242,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Thanks to you.
206306,L322241,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark."
206307,L322240,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Brian, he's coming around!"
206308,L322239,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Believe me, I am."
206309,L322238,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Get ready to go.
206310,L322237,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Hello.  I think his nap's over.
206311,L322236,u6101,m404,PHILIP,And here I thought I was charming you.
206312,L322235,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I think that you and I are natural enemies.
206313,L322234,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos..."
206314,L322233,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself."
206315,L322232,u6101,m404,PHILIP,That's because I am the shark.
206316,L322231,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life."
206317,L322230,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Philip.
206318,L322229,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton."
206319,L322228,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else."
206320,L322227,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Somebody could have gotten hurt.
206321,L322226,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Some miss all their shots.
206322,L322225,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
206323,L322224,u6101,m404,PHILIP,You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
206324,L322223,u6101,m404,PHILIP,And I like you.
206325,L322222,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,So do I.  But for different reasons.
206326,L322221,u6101,m404,PHILIP,I like it when they wake up.
206327,L322220,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Why are you?
206328,L322219,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Not at all.
206329,L322218,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Thanks for helping.
206330,L322217,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
206331,L322214,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Just watch it when he does.
206332,L322213,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Should be coming out of it soon.
206333,L322212,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog."
206334,L322211,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Still sleeping.
206335,L322210,u6101,m404,PHILIP,How's sleeping beauty?
206336,L322172,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself."
206337,L322171,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!"
206338,L322170,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Afraid I can't do that.
206339,L322169,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I insist you get rid of that bomb.
206340,L322166,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Because I don't trust you, that's why."
206341,L322165,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Why?
206342,L322164,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
206343,L322163,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Let's hope he knows that.
206344,L322162,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,We're taking that shark alive!
206345,L322161,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
206346,L322160,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,What in hell is that?
206347,L322159,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
206348,L322158,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,You look like an orange worm.
206349,L322114,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"So do I, love."
206350,L322113,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I want that shark alive.
206351,L322107,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Make a lovely item for ""Good Morning, America"""
206352,L322106,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Like hell!
206353,L322105,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Well, then I'm going to film it."
206354,L322104,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I will.
206355,L322102,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line..."
206356,L322101,u6101,m404,PHILIP,A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
206357,L322100,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
206358,L322099,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
206359,L322098,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!"
206360,L322097,u6101,m404,PHILIP,It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
206361,L322096,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,No!
206362,L322095,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard."
206363,L322094,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
206364,L322093,u6101,m404,PHILIP,You can get killed!
206365,L322088,u6101,m404,PHILIP,That's preposterous!
206366,L322087,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
206367,L322086,u6101,m404,PHILIP,That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
206368,L322085,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --"
206369,L322084,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
206370,L321896,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop."
206371,L321895,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I'm sorry.
206372,L321894,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all."
206373,L321893,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"I told you, something's upset them."
206374,L321892,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"No, no.  That won't do."
206375,L321891,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I can have them walk backwards.
206376,L321890,u6101,m404,PHILIP,I thought they were clever.
206377,L321889,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,"Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins."
206378,L321888,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?"
206379,L321887,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
206380,L321862,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Make this quick!
206381,L321861,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
206382,L321853,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Yes, aren't we all."
206383,L321852,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
206384,L321851,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Fine.  Have them do some.
206385,L321850,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
206386,L321849,u6101,m404,PHILIP,I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
206387,L321848,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Nobody told me.
206388,L321847,u6101,m404,PHILIP,On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
206389,L321846,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Go where?
206390,L322320,u6102,m404,RUTH,We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
206391,L322319,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,Not good enough.
206392,L322318,u6102,m404,RUTH,No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
206393,L322316,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I should have never listened to Calvin.
206394,L322315,u6102,m404,RUTH,Don't blame yourself.
206395,L322314,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
206396,L322311,u6102,m404,RUTH,Ten minutes ago.
206397,L322310,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,When did this happen?
206398,L322200,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,And big for his age.
206399,L322199,u6102,m404,RUTH,He's a young one.
206400,L322012,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I know.
206401,L322011,u6102,m404,RUTH,They still seem nervous.
206402,L322010,u6095,m404,KATHRYN,I think they'll come out now.
206403,L322347,u6098,m404,MIKE,Better than catching Sean's herpes.
206404,L322346,u6096,m404,KELLY,I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
206405,L322345,u6098,m404,MIKE,"How you doing, Kelly?"
206406,L322344,u6096,m404,KELLY,"Hi, Mike."
206407,L322202,u6096,m404,KELLY,Someone's looking for you.
206408,L322201,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Sean.  Sean, where are you?"
206409,L321985,u6098,m404,MIKE,Thanks.
206410,L321984,u6096,m404,KELLY,Sure.  No problem.
206411,L321983,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?"
206412,L321982,u6096,m404,KELLY,Hope with none of my girl friends.
206413,L321981,u6098,m404,MIKE,He's missing.
206414,L321980,u6096,m404,KELLY,Musclehead?
206415,L321955,u6096,m404,KELLY,'Preciate it.
206416,L321954,u6098,m404,MIKE,Sure.
206417,L321953,u6096,m404,KELLY,Give me a ride?
206418,L322488,u6096,m404,KELLY,SEAN!
206419,L322487,u6103,m404,SEAN,Take it up!
206420,L322485,u6096,m404,KELLY,He's diving!
206421,L322484,u6103,m404,SEAN,Take it up.
206422,L322483,u6096,m404,KELLY,"It's okay, Sean."
206423,L322482,u6103,m404,SEAN,"Let's go, let's go!"
206424,L322480,u6096,m404,KELLY,"What, hon?"
206425,L322479,u6103,m404,SEAN,No...  It can't be.
206426,L322478,u6096,m404,KELLY,Goes up.
206427,L322477,u6103,m404,SEAN,Now what's this do?
206428,L322476,u6096,m404,KELLY,Told you you'd like it.
206429,L322475,u6103,m404,SEAN,Can hardly wait to do it again.
206430,L322474,u6096,m404,KELLY,Isn't this fun!
206431,L322365,u6103,m404,SEAN,"I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?"
206432,L322364,u6096,m404,KELLY,"Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature."
206433,L322363,u6103,m404,SEAN,"No, think of something else."
206434,L322362,u6096,m404,KELLY,You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
206435,L322361,u6103,m404,SEAN,"Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?"
206436,L322360,u6096,m404,KELLY,"Come on, it's fun!"
206437,L322359,u6103,m404,SEAN,"No, Kelly, I don't want to..."
206438,L322358,u6096,m404,KELLY,"Yes, it's great!"
206439,L322357,u6103,m404,SEAN,The one that goes underwater?
206440,L322356,u6096,m404,KELLY,I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
206441,L322355,u6103,m404,SEAN,"I don't know, what else is there?"
206442,L322354,u6096,m404,KELLY,Besides that.
206443,L322352,u6103,m404,SEAN,No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
206444,L322351,u6096,m404,KELLY,"Sean, do you have herpes?"
206445,L322349,u6103,m404,SEAN,Why you sonuvabitch...
206446,L322348,u6096,m404,KELLY,Herpes?
206447,L322343,u6103,m404,SEAN,As always.
206448,L322342,u6096,m404,KELLY,Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
206449,L322341,u6103,m404,SEAN,You were great out there!
206450,L322050,u6096,m404,KELLY,And alone.
206451,L322049,u6103,m404,SEAN,This is where to be.  High and dry.
206452,L322039,u6096,m404,KELLY,Come on!  Check this out!
206453,L322038,u6103,m404,SEAN,"Well, I needed a cold shower."
206454,L321976,u6103,m404,SEAN,"Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it."
206455,L321975,u6096,m404,KELLY,How come?
206456,L321974,u6103,m404,SEAN,That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
206457,L321973,u6096,m404,KELLY,Sure am.
206458,L321972,u6103,m404,SEAN,Are you really?
206459,L321971,u6096,m404,KELLY,I'm a water-skier.
206460,L321970,u6103,m404,SEAN,Depends on big brother.
206461,L321969,u6096,m404,KELLY,You gonna work at The Kingdom?
206462,L321968,u6096,m404,KELLY,"Well, wait till you see the rest."
206463,L321967,u6103,m404,SEAN,"I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great."
206464,L321966,u6096,m404,KELLY,You like Florida?
206465,L321965,u6103,m404,SEAN,"I don't know, it depends."
206466,L321964,u6096,m404,KELLY,How long you staying?
206467,L321963,u6103,m404,SEAN,... Massachussettans aren't.
206468,L321962,u6096,m404,KELLY,'Course they're also so rich.
206469,L321961,u6103,m404,SEAN,Massachussettans aren't.
206470,L321960,u6096,m404,KELLY,"I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive."
206471,L321959,u6103,m404,SEAN,"Yeah, from Boston."
206472,L321958,u6096,m404,KELLY,"So, you just get here?"
206473,L322305,u6096,m404,KELLY,Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
206474,L322304,u6105,m404,TOD,"Back, Kelly.  Lean back!"
206475,L321867,u6096,m404,KELLY,Can't help it... ahh...
206476,L321866,u6105,m404,TOD,Don't you dare.
206477,L321865,u6096,m404,KELLY,Gotta sneeze.
206478,L321864,u6105,m404,TOD,Now what?
206479,L321863,u6096,m404,KELLY,"Ahhh, ahhh..."
206480,L321801,u6105,m404,TOD,"Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!"
206481,L321800,u6096,m404,KELLY,"Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!"
206482,L321786,u6105,m404,TOD,I am serious.
206483,L321785,u6096,m404,KELLY,"Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!"
206484,L321784,u6105,m404,TOD,"Remember, skiers stay up longer."
206485,L321783,u6096,m404,KELLY,I don't talk that way.
206486,L321780,u6105,m404,TOD,I thought I was your boyfriend.
206487,L321779,u6096,m404,KELLY,Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
206488,L321778,u6105,m404,TOD,What're you doing later?
206489,L321777,u6096,m404,KELLY,"Hold still, damn it!"
206490,L321776,u6105,m404,TOD,The space shuttle has landed!
206491,L322375,u6097,m404,MAN,It's disappeared.
206492,L322374,u6106,m404,WOMAN,"Yes, there is goes."
206493,L322373,u6097,m404,MAN,That?
206494,L322372,u6106,m404,WOMAN,On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
206495,L322371,u6097,m404,MAN,What?
206496,L322370,u6106,m404,WOMAN,Did you see that?
206497,L322535,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Always do.
206498,L322534,u6098,m404,MIKE,"He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself."
206499,L322523,u6098,m404,MIKE,I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
206500,L322522,u6101,m404,PHILIP,I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
206501,L322521,u6098,m404,MIKE,No way.
206502,L322520,u6101,m404,PHILIP,I'll go with you.
206503,L322508,u6101,m404,PHILIP,You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
206504,L322507,u6098,m404,MIKE,"After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?"
206505,L322438,u6101,m404,PHILIP,You have a man near it?
206506,L322437,u6098,m404,MIKE,Five hundred yards.
206507,L322436,u6101,m404,PHILIP,How far away is filter number four?
206508,L322435,u6098,m404,MIKE,It's large enough...
206509,L322434,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
206510,L322421,u6098,m404,MIKE,"That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool."
206511,L322420,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate."
206512,L322406,u6098,m404,MIKE,"I'll remember that, my Lordship."
206513,L322405,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Reach for the limit I always say.
206514,L322404,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?"
206515,L322403,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
206516,L322402,u6098,m404,MIKE,How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
206517,L322401,u6101,m404,PHILIP,The world's southern most reaches.
206518,L322400,u6098,m404,MIKE,Oh...
206519,L322399,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"South Georgia, Antarctica."
206520,L322398,u6098,m404,MIKE,Polar bears in Georgia???
206521,L322397,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Polar bears.
206522,L322396,u6098,m404,MIKE,What the hell's there?
206523,L322395,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"No, South Georgia."
206524,L322394,u6098,m404,MIKE,"So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?"
206525,L322393,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Thanks.  Bullshot.
206526,L322392,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink."
206527,L322391,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck."
206528,L322390,u6098,m404,MIKE,Buzz off.
206529,L322389,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw."
206530,L322388,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Hey, I don't want to hear."
206531,L322387,u6101,m404,PHILIP,I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
206532,L322386,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Yeah, poor bastard."
206533,L322385,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
206534,L322198,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?"
206535,L322197,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot."
206536,L322168,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Precisely.
206537,L322167,u6098,m404,MIKE,"You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen."
206538,L321860,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Aww, can't I keep it?"
206539,L321859,u6098,m404,MIKE,Make sure you put this back.
206540,L321845,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?"
206541,L321844,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Yeah, well I didn't!"
206542,L321843,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Calvin said it was all right.
206543,L321842,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?"
206544,L321841,u6098,m404,MIKE,Hey.
206545,L321840,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
206546,L322176,u6098,m404,MIKE,"All right, hit those lights too."
206547,L322175,u6099,m404,OPERATOR,"We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island."
206548,L322152,u6099,m404,OPERATOR,"Right, Mike."
206549,L322151,u6098,m404,MIKE,Let us know as soon as you have anything.
206550,L321835,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it."
206551,L321834,u6099,m404,OPERATOR,I know.  But we show it's not closing.
206552,L321833,u6098,m404,MIKE,That's impossible.
206553,L321832,u6099,m404,OPERATOR,"It's not closing, Mike."
206554,L321831,u6098,m404,MIKE,What kind of trouble?
206555,L322340,u6103,m404,SEAN,Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
206556,L322339,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --"
206557,L322338,u6103,m404,SEAN,"No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it."
206558,L322337,u6098,m404,MIKE,Sure.
206559,L322336,u6103,m404,SEAN,We're in love.
206560,L322335,u6098,m404,MIKE,She still talking to you?
206561,L322333,u6098,m404,MIKE,It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
206562,L322332,u6103,m404,SEAN,"Yeah, he'll really go for that."
206563,L322331,u6098,m404,MIKE,Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
206564,L322330,u6103,m404,SEAN,"Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?"
206565,L322329,u6098,m404,MIKE,"This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco."
206566,L322328,u6103,m404,SEAN,You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
206567,L322327,u6098,m404,MIKE,"It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time."
206568,L322326,u6103,m404,SEAN,"Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building."
206569,L321994,u6103,m404,SEAN,Don't hurry back.
206570,L321993,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go."
206571,L321979,u6098,m404,MIKE,You know Overman?
206572,L321978,u6103,m404,SEAN,Something wrong?
206573,L321977,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Come on, let's go."
206574,L321951,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea."
206575,L321950,u6103,m404,SEAN,I want to see Kathryn.
206576,L321949,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Gee, it's good to see you!"
206577,L321948,u6103,m404,SEAN,Who's grown up?
206578,L321947,u6098,m404,MIKE,"He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did."
206579,L321946,u6098,m404,MIKE,That's Dad...
206580,L321945,u6103,m404,SEAN,Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
206581,L321944,u6098,m404,MIKE,Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
206582,L321943,u6103,m404,SEAN,Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
206583,L321942,u6098,m404,MIKE,How is he?  Still fighting crime?
206584,L321941,u6103,m404,SEAN,"Yeah, right."
206585,L321940,u6098,m404,MIKE,He needs a haircut.
206586,L321939,u6103,m404,SEAN,Took it this morning.
206587,L321938,u6103,m404,SEAN,So was Dad.
206588,L321937,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Hey, I'm proud of you, kid."
206589,L321936,u6103,m404,SEAN,"Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes."
206590,L321935,u6098,m404,MIKE,How'd you do in school?
206591,L321934,u6103,m404,SEAN,... I'll go to McDonalds.
206592,L321933,u6098,m404,MIKE,In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
206593,L321932,u6103,m404,SEAN,Sharks???
206594,L321931,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something."
206595,L321930,u6103,m404,SEAN,Got a job for me?
206596,L321929,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Look great, don't I?"
206597,L321928,u6103,m404,SEAN,Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
206598,L321927,u6098,m404,MIKE,"Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!"
206599,L322256,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
206600,L322255,u6104,m404,SHELLY,You want to show this?
206601,L322127,u6101,m404,PHILIP,She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
206602,L322126,u6104,m404,SHELLY,I wouldn't mind going down with her.
206603,L322125,u6101,m404,PHILIP,Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
206604,L322124,u6104,m404,SHELLY,That bugger moves fast.
206605,L322123,u6101,m404,PHILIP,"We'll shoot this with an .18, boys."
206606,L324960,u6117,m405,THEA,"It's time for tea, Grandma."
206607,L324959,u6107,m405,CARLA,"Yes, I did."
206608,L324958,u6117,m405,THEA,You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
206609,L324542,u6107,m405,CARLA,"Yes, you can make sandwiches...."
206610,L324541,u6117,m405,THEA,Can I make sandwiches...?
206611,L324535,u6117,m405,THEA,My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
206612,L324534,u6107,m405,CARLA,"Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee...."
206613,L324524,u6117,m405,THEA,Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
206614,L324523,u6107,m405,CARLA,You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.
206615,L324423,u6117,m405,THEA,I don't want to.  I want to swing....
206616,L324422,u6107,m405,CARLA,Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
206617,L324421,u6117,m405,THEA,"Daddy, why can't I...?"
206618,L324420,u6107,m405,CARLA,"Not today.  Come on, Thea...."
206619,L324419,u6117,m405,THEA,But you always let me....
206620,L324418,u6107,m405,CARLA,"Come on, sweetheart...."
206621,L324413,u6117,m405,THEA,"Watch me, Grandma...."
206622,L324412,u6107,m405,CARLA,It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....
206623,L324371,u6107,m405,CARLA,Don't bother Hoagie....
206624,L324370,u6117,m405,THEA,Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
206625,L324369,u6107,m405,CARLA,Thea....
206626,L324340,u6117,m405,THEA,That's what grandmas are for.
206627,L324339,u6107,m405,CARLA,You'll spoil her.
206628,L325109,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you."
206629,L325108,u6107,m405,CARLA,Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
206630,L325107,u6107,m405,CARLA,I don't know....
206631,L325106,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Where's my mother?
206632,L325105,u6107,m405,CARLA,How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
206633,L325104,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Where is she?
206634,L325103,u6107,m405,CARLA,She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
206635,L325102,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Sweetheart....
206636,L325101,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,It went away....
206637,L325100,u6107,m405,CARLA,You knew...?
206638,L325097,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,But it went away...We would have known....
206639,L325096,u6107,m405,CARLA,The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
206640,L325095,u6107,m405,CARLA,Thea was attacked by a shark....
206641,L325094,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What's wrong?  What happened?
206642,L325093,u6107,m405,CARLA,Where have you been...?
206643,L324879,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,They're at the beach....
206644,L324878,u6107,m405,CARLA,Close the door.
206645,L324877,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
206646,L324876,u6107,m405,CARLA,I have work....
206647,L324875,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Off....
206648,L324874,u6107,m405,CARLA,No....
206649,L324873,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Turn it off....
206650,L324872,u6107,m405,CARLA,Then don't come any closer.
206651,L324871,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"No fair, I'm not armed."
206652,L324870,u6107,m405,CARLA,I don't know...You...I don't know.
206653,L324869,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What the hell are we arguing about?
206654,L324868,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage...."
206655,L324867,u6107,m405,CARLA,We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
206656,L324866,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out...."
206657,L324863,u6107,m405,CARLA,Because....
206658,L324862,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,How come it's my responsibility?
206659,L324861,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
206660,L324860,u6107,m405,CARLA,Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
206661,L324859,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
206662,L324858,u6107,m405,CARLA,It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
206663,L324577,u6107,m405,CARLA,Tell Matt he should be here....
206664,L324576,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone."
206665,L324444,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I'll be right there.
206666,L324443,u6107,m405,CARLA,We need beer....
206667,L324442,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
206668,L324441,u6107,m405,CARLA,We need milk....
206669,L324440,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Make a list.
206670,L324439,u6107,m405,CARLA,We forgot to stop at the store.
206671,L324438,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach...."
206672,L324409,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,It sure is....
206673,L324408,u6107,m405,CARLA,It sure is good to be home....
206674,L324363,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets...."
206675,L324362,u6107,m405,CARLA,"Like mother, like son...."
206676,L324358,u6107,m405,CARLA,Chicken....
206677,L324357,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,No way....
206678,L324356,u6107,m405,CARLA,I've always wanted to ride one of those....
206679,L324345,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now...."
206680,L324344,u6107,m405,CARLA,What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
206681,L324326,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Nowhere....
206682,L324325,u6107,m405,CARLA,Where are you going?
206683,L324322,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....
206684,L324321,u6107,m405,CARLA,He was doing his job....
206685,L324320,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
206686,L324299,u6107,m405,CARLA,He told me you both did....
206687,L324298,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
206688,L325253,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You make sure they come?
206689,L325252,u6107,m405,CARLA,We'll be there....
206690,L325251,u6109,m405,ELLEN,We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
206691,L324957,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
206692,L324956,u6107,m405,CARLA,Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
206693,L324955,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me...."
206694,L324954,u6107,m405,CARLA,"Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens."
206695,L324953,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
206696,L324952,u6107,m405,CARLA,Whatever happens next.....
206697,L324951,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Beginning of what?
206698,L324950,u6107,m405,CARLA,It's beginning....
206699,L324949,u6109,m405,ELLEN,All he did was kiss me....
206700,L324780,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
206701,L324779,u6107,m405,CARLA,At least he doesn't have a beard....
206702,L324745,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'd be afraid of losing....
206703,L324744,u6107,m405,CARLA,You want to try your hand at something...?
206704,L324483,u6107,m405,CARLA,"You're not interfering, Ellen...."
206705,L324482,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You caught me....
206706,L324481,u6107,m405,CARLA,Henny Youngman....
206707,L324480,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
206708,L324479,u6107,m405,CARLA,"I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub...."
206709,L324478,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I can't help it....
206710,L324477,u6107,m405,CARLA,Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
206711,L324476,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
206712,L324475,u6107,m405,CARLA,I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
206713,L324411,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I like it.  Really....
206714,L324410,u6107,m405,CARLA,It'll grow on you.
206715,L324395,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm not on vacation....
206716,L324394,u6107,m405,CARLA,No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
206717,L325042,u6112,m405,JAKE,He knows what he has to do....
206718,L325041,u6108,m405,CLARENCE,I hope the man knows what he's doing....
206719,L325024,u6112,m405,JAKE,We'll divert it...We'll do something....
206720,L325023,u6108,m405,CLARENCE,They won't kill it....
206721,L325022,u6112,m405,JAKE,We're going down.  All of us....
206722,L325021,u6108,m405,CLARENCE,Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
206723,L325020,u6112,m405,JAKE,Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
206724,L324727,u6112,m405,JAKE,What difference does it make?  It's here....
206725,L324726,u6108,m405,CLARENCE,What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
206726,L324640,u6112,m405,JAKE,You have something to say about everything....
206727,L324639,u6108,m405,CLARENCE,Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
206728,L324625,u6108,m405,CLARENCE,Spent it all on beer....
206729,L324624,u6112,m405,JAKE,We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
206730,L324468,u6112,m405,JAKE,Michael!
206731,L324467,u6108,m405,CLARENCE,You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
206732,L324466,u6112,m405,JAKE,Michael!  This thing working?
206733,L324235,u6116,m405,SEAN,I won't....
206734,L324234,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Don't be late.
206735,L324223,u6109,m405,ELLEN,A small one...Your brother won't be here....
206736,L324222,u6116,m405,SEAN,A big one....
206737,L324216,u6116,m405,SEAN,Good.
206738,L324215,u6109,m405,ELLEN,He heard that.
206739,L324214,u6116,m405,SEAN,Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
206740,L324207,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm on the phone....
206741,L324206,u6116,m405,SEAN,You check it....
206742,L324205,u6109,m405,ELLEN,The fish.  Check it....
206743,L324199,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
206744,L324198,u6116,m405,SEAN,We don't want any....
206745,L324197,u6116,m405,SEAN,Adds flavor....
206746,L324196,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Are you all right?
206747,L324192,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
206748,L324191,u6116,m405,SEAN,"I'm hungry, Mom...."
206749,L324190,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I see what you're doing....
206750,L324187,u6116,m405,SEAN,Can't help myself....
206751,L324186,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
206752,L324185,u6116,m405,SEAN,That hurt....
206753,L324184,u6116,m405,SEAN,I'm not doing anything.
206754,L324183,u6109,m405,ELLEN,That....
206755,L324182,u6116,m405,SEAN,Stop what?
206756,L324181,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Stop that....
206757,L325255,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'll miss you....
206758,L325254,u6117,m405,THEA,"I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma."
206759,L324970,u6117,m405,THEA,"Good night, Daddy...."
206760,L324969,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'll be in to read you a story.
206761,L324964,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Thanks for the consultation....
206762,L324963,u6117,m405,THEA,I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
206763,L324962,u6117,m405,THEA,I didn't.
206764,L324961,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I almost forgot....
206765,L324656,u6117,m405,THEA,The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
206766,L324655,u6109,m405,ELLEN,What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
206767,L324609,u6117,m405,THEA,It's not nice to be evasive.
206768,L324608,u6109,m405,ELLEN,No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
206769,L324607,u6117,m405,THEA,Who's coming?
206770,L324606,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"You're coming, aren't you...?"
206771,L324604,u6117,m405,THEA,You're silly....
206772,L324603,u6109,m405,ELLEN,We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
206773,L324514,u6117,m405,THEA,I'm still five....
206774,L324513,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Your father was six then.  Just like you....
206775,L324417,u6117,m405,THEA,Mommy lets me....
206776,L324416,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"No, no...It's too dangerous...."
206777,L324397,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Thank you....
206778,L324396,u6117,m405,THEA,I like Grandma's cooking....
206779,L324365,u6117,m405,THEA,Where's the lady who brings the soda?
206780,L324364,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I never....
206781,L324361,u6109,m405,ELLEN,It's too dangerous....
206782,L324360,u6117,m405,THEA,Can I ride one sometime...?
206783,L324348,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
206784,L324347,u6117,m405,THEA,You can stay in my room.
206785,L324346,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Yes!
206786,L324211,u6117,m405,THEA,What's going on?
206787,L324210,u6109,m405,ELLEN,In a minute....
206788,L325272,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us...."
206789,L325271,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael...."
206790,L325258,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
206791,L325257,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Promise me....
206792,L325256,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Promise me you'll be all right....
206793,L325250,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
206794,L325249,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
206795,L325187,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Why'd you take the boat?
206796,L325186,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Why'd you come out here?
206797,L325185,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,It got him....
206798,L324989,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,No.
206799,L324988,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You hungry?
206800,L324987,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
206801,L324986,u6109,m405,ELLEN,It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
206802,L324985,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I don't want to talk about that.
206803,L324984,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
206804,L324983,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm your mother.  It's my job....
206805,L324982,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,There's nothing to worry about....
206806,L324981,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
206807,L324980,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
206808,L324979,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
206809,L324978,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I have to get this finished.
206810,L324977,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You and Sean used to make....
206811,L324975,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I'm fine....
206812,L324974,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You look tired....
206813,L324973,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Trying to write our report....
206814,L324972,u6109,m405,ELLEN,It's late....
206815,L324824,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are."
206816,L324823,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,You just got here....
206817,L324822,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then...."
206818,L324821,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
206819,L324820,u6109,m405,ELLEN,That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
206820,L324819,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Good.
206821,L324818,u6109,m405,ELLEN,It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
206822,L324816,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
206823,L324815,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,You're not a pain in the ass....
206824,L324814,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
206825,L324812,u6109,m405,ELLEN,He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
206826,L324811,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....
206827,L324810,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I enjoy his company....
206828,L324808,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I am.
206829,L324807,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,You're having a good time....
206830,L324597,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
206831,L324596,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I'm not going to quit now....
206832,L324595,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You could teach...You could....
206833,L324594,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Mom, please don't start that again...."
206834,L324593,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I want you to give up your work....
206835,L324518,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
206836,L324517,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Nothing out of the ordinary....
206837,L324437,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Good.  So will I....
206838,L324436,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"I'll be all right, Michael."
206839,L324435,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go."
206840,L324434,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Okay.
206841,L324433,u6109,m405,ELLEN,How are you doing?
206842,L324432,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm fine....
206843,L324431,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,All you all right?
206844,L324429,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You were a monkey....
206845,L324428,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
206846,L324427,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I didn't mean to start that....
206847,L324426,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Come on, I'll show you around."
206848,L324425,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma...."
206849,L324400,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
206850,L324399,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid...."
206851,L324318,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
206852,L324317,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
206853,L324316,u6109,m405,ELLEN,He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
206854,L324315,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Dad died from a heart attack....
206855,L324314,u6109,m405,ELLEN,It picked Sean...It killed your father....
206856,L324313,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person...."
206857,L324312,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
206858,L324311,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please...."
206859,L324310,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I don't want you in the water anymore....
206860,L324309,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I'm just getting started....
206861,L324308,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You're damn right I'm serious....
206862,L324307,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Come on, Mom, you can't be serious...."
206863,L324306,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I want you to give up that terrible job.
206864,L324305,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What?
206865,L324304,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I want you to get out of the water....
206866,L324302,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You guys must be starving....
206867,L324301,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Sit down, Ma...."
206868,L324295,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Mother....
206869,L324294,u6109,m405,ELLEN,It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
206870,L325245,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Yes you can....
206871,L325244,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I can't....
206872,L325191,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
206873,L325190,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I tried to tell you...I tried....
206874,L324917,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,My vision is perfect....
206875,L324916,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You sure you don't need glasses?
206876,L324914,u6109,m405,ELLEN,The whole idea is preposterous....
206877,L324913,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,There's nothing to be sorry about.
206878,L324912,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm sorry...I....
206879,L324911,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
206880,L324910,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Why?
206881,L324909,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody."
206882,L324908,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
206883,L324907,u6109,m405,ELLEN,There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
206884,L324906,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
206885,L324905,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Won't you get in trouble...?
206886,L324904,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I borrow it without telling him....
206887,L324903,u6109,m405,ELLEN,What?
206888,L324902,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I'll nick the boss' plane again....
206889,L324901,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I like to travel....
206890,L324900,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You're always taking time off....
206891,L324899,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I could take some time off....
206892,L324898,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
206893,L324897,u6109,m405,ELLEN,That's hard to imagine....
206894,L324896,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy...."
206895,L324895,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,But it gets cold in winter....
206896,L324894,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I have my own little island.
206897,L324893,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Our little island seems to agree with you....
206898,L324799,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Good.  I have two left....
206899,L324798,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I have two right feet.
206900,L324797,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You'll be sorry.
206901,L324796,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Would you suffer through a dance with me?
206902,L324753,u6109,m405,ELLEN,No!
206903,L324752,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
206904,L324751,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You're not going to bet it all....
206905,L324750,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline...."
206906,L324723,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,A big one....
206907,L324722,u6109,m405,ELLEN,A big one....
206908,L324721,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,A drink with an umbrella in it....
206909,L324719,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
206910,L324718,u6109,m405,ELLEN,The kind with an umbrella in it....
206911,L324717,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it...."
206912,L324716,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You promised me a drink....
206913,L324712,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm terrific... Come on....
206914,L324711,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"No, you're not...."
206915,L324710,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm fine.
206916,L324709,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Nothing....
206917,L324708,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,What's wrong?
206918,L324687,u6109,m405,ELLEN,It's wonderful....
206919,L324686,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,How do you like flying?
206920,L324683,u6109,m405,ELLEN,The plane's turning....
206921,L324682,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut...."
206922,L324681,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You're impossible....
206923,L324680,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
206924,L324679,u6109,m405,ELLEN,"You're not going to tell me, are you?"
206925,L324678,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
206926,L324677,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
206927,L324675,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
206928,L324674,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Where do I pull off...?
206929,L324673,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,It's just like driving a car....
206930,L324671,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute."
206931,L324670,u6109,m405,ELLEN,What are you doing?
206932,L324669,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,No one does till they learn....
206933,L324668,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I don't know how....
206934,L324667,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Sure you can....
206935,L324666,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I can't....
206936,L324665,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
206937,L324664,u6109,m405,ELLEN,How can you just take the plane like this?
206938,L324658,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Doesn't matter....
206939,L324657,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Depends on where you want to go....
206940,L324654,u6109,m405,ELLEN,When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
206941,L324653,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities...."
206942,L324652,u6109,m405,ELLEN,It was no accident....
206943,L324651,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,It could have been an accident....
206944,L324650,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
206945,L324649,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I always listen to my feelings....
206946,L324648,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
206947,L324647,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
206948,L324646,u6109,m405,ELLEN,I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
206949,L324617,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
206950,L324616,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Flies the plane....
206951,L324388,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
206952,L324387,u6109,m405,ELLEN,Can you just go off...?
206953,L324380,u6109,m405,ELLEN,You must get bored easily.
206954,L324379,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
206955,L324378,u6109,m405,ELLEN,No....
206956,L325267,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
206957,L325266,u6117,m405,THEA,Yes I can....
206958,L325265,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
206959,L324660,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Just like that?
206960,L324659,u6117,m405,THEA,Hurry!
206961,L324620,u6117,m405,THEA,I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
206962,L324619,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,You the architect?
206963,L324615,u6117,m405,THEA,You're the man who drives the plane.
206964,L324614,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'"
206965,L324386,u6117,m405,THEA,I do....
206966,L324385,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Want to go for a little ride?
206967,L324377,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
206968,L324376,u6117,m405,THEA,How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
206969,L324375,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I'll get it back next time.
206970,L324368,u6117,m405,THEA,I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
206971,L324367,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I have coffee in the thermos.
206972,L324366,u6117,m405,THEA,They had them on the big one....
206973,L325227,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"Aye, aye, Captain...."
206974,L325226,u6112,m405,JAKE,Keep it steady....
206975,L325199,u6112,m405,JAKE,They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
206976,L325198,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
206977,L325194,u6112,m405,JAKE,Get her started....
206978,L325193,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ..."
206979,L325178,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
206980,L325177,u6112,m405,JAKE,It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
206981,L325176,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy...."
206982,L325174,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,"Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?"
206983,L325173,u6112,m405,JAKE,You sure you know how to do this.
206984,L325172,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Grab your socks....
206985,L325131,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,She said it was coming....
206986,L325130,u6112,m405,JAKE,"What do you mean, it'll find her?"
206987,L325128,u6112,m405,JAKE,"She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't...."
206988,L325127,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
206989,L325124,u6112,m405,JAKE,You got a better idea...?
206990,L325123,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
206991,L325121,u6112,m405,JAKE,A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
206992,L325120,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I hope she's a good sailor....
206993,L324758,u6112,m405,JAKE,We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
206994,L324757,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
206995,L325239,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,It needs more time to charge.
206996,L325238,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,The damn thing is going to have our asses....
206997,L325234,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
206998,L325233,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What happened?
206999,L325180,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
207000,L325179,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Come on, Hoagie...."
207001,L325149,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
207002,L325148,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Can't this thing go any faster?
207003,L325144,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,I fly elephants for smugglers....
207004,L325143,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
207005,L325142,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,What's that....?
207006,L325141,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
207007,L324806,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
207008,L324805,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
207009,L324374,u6110,m405,HOAGIE,Good news travels fast....
207010,L324373,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
207011,L324588,u6111,m405,HOOPER,"You too, Michael...."
207012,L324587,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt...."
207013,L324586,u6111,m405,HOOPER,Let me speak to Ellen....
207014,L324582,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them."
207015,L324581,u6111,m405,HOOPER,Feathers all over the place....
207016,L324580,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
207017,L324574,u6111,m405,HOOPER,"Oh, boy...."
207018,L324573,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
207019,L324572,u6111,m405,HOOPER,She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
207020,L324571,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I wish there was something I could do....
207021,L324570,u6111,m405,HOOPER,She's a tough lady....
207022,L324569,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,She has good days and bad...I don't know....
207023,L324567,u6111,m405,HOOPER,How's Ellen?
207024,L324566,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Inch by inch....
207025,L324565,u6111,m405,HOOPER,"Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?"
207026,L324564,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,We'll be done pretty soon....
207027,L324563,u6111,m405,HOOPER,Still tagging conch?
207028,L324562,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Still chasing fish?
207029,L324561,u6111,m405,HOOPER,Yeah....
207030,L324559,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel...."
207031,L324558,u6111,m405,HOOPER,I don't know what the hell to say....
207032,L324557,u6111,m405,HOOPER,Tell Thea I'm sorry....
207033,L324556,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Matt?
207034,L325225,u6112,m405,JAKE,I'm the one who wanted to study it....
207035,L325224,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Jake.
207036,L325223,u6112,m405,JAKE,"We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me...."
207037,L325222,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,It's my fault...I have to....
207038,L325221,u6112,m405,JAKE,No way....
207039,L325220,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"I'll do it, Jake."
207040,L325215,u6112,m405,JAKE,My equipment doesn't crap out....
207041,L325214,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Your equipment has crapped out again....
207042,L325212,u6112,m405,JAKE,I forgot my rubber gloves.  Let's do it.
207043,L325211,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his...."
207044,L325210,u6112,m405,JAKE,"Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture."
207045,L325207,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself...."
207046,L325206,u6112,m405,JAKE,"Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away...."
207047,L325205,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,It'll work....
207048,L325204,u6112,m405,JAKE,All the time....
207049,L325203,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
207050,L325202,u6112,m405,JAKE,"If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio."
207051,L325164,u6112,m405,JAKE,"You jump, you'll kill yourself...."
207052,L325163,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I've got to get to her....
207053,L325162,u6112,m405,JAKE,What the hell are you doing?
207054,L325158,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Mom....
207055,L325157,u6112,m405,JAKE,Holy Christ....
207056,L325083,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Screw you, Jake...."
207057,L325082,u6112,m405,JAKE,You told me what?
207058,L325080,u6112,m405,JAKE,"Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'"
207059,L325079,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I don't like the song.
207060,L325078,u6112,m405,JAKE,You don't like my voice...?
207061,L325077,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Stop that!
207062,L325076,u6112,m405,JAKE,"You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'"
207063,L325075,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Shove it....
207064,L325074,u6112,m405,JAKE,"Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made...."
207065,L325073,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Shit....
207066,L325072,u6112,m405,JAKE,'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
207067,L325071,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,'Snuck up on me....'
207068,L325070,u6112,m405,JAKE,'A Moray eel....'
207069,L325069,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
207070,L325068,u6112,m405,JAKE,A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
207071,L325051,u6112,m405,JAKE,Just trying to be helpful....
207072,L325050,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Funny, Jake...Funny."
207073,L325049,u6112,m405,JAKE,Maybe he only likes white meat....
207074,L325048,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,How come only me?
207075,L325047,u6112,m405,JAKE,Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
207076,L325046,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
207077,L325045,u6112,m405,JAKE,I live to hear the sound...You all right?
207078,L325044,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,You getting a reading on them?
207079,L325040,u6112,m405,JAKE,She's not going to like it....
207080,L325039,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"I'm going down, Jake...."
207081,L325038,u6112,m405,JAKE,What about Carla's gig?
207082,L325037,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I didn't ask you to....
207083,L325036,u6112,m405,JAKE,I don't like it....
207084,L325035,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again...."
207085,L325034,u6112,m405,JAKE,"It's my turn in the barrel, man...."
207086,L325008,u6112,m405,JAKE,Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
207087,L325007,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I'm coming...How close is it?
207088,L324999,u6112,m405,JAKE,Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
207089,L324998,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
207090,L324946,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Maybe it's gone....
207091,L324945,u6112,m405,JAKE,If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
207092,L324944,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Maybe the gear crapped out....
207093,L324943,u6112,m405,JAKE,We lost it....
207094,L324942,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
207095,L324941,u6112,m405,JAKE,He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
207096,L324940,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I am...You must know something about him....
207097,L324939,u6112,m405,JAKE,Half don't...Bring her about....
207098,L324938,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
207099,L324937,u6112,m405,JAKE,Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
207100,L324936,u6112,m405,JAKE,"You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now."
207101,L324935,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What's so funny about that?
207102,L324933,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What do you know about him?
207103,L324932,u6112,m405,JAKE,I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
207104,L324931,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Hoagie.
207105,L324930,u6112,m405,JAKE,Who?
207106,L324929,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,How long has he been here...?
207107,L324928,u6112,m405,JAKE,Bring her to starboard.
207108,L324927,u6112,m405,JAKE,As long as he's been here....
207109,L324926,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,How long?
207110,L324925,u6112,m405,JAKE,What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
207111,L324924,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,How long have you known Hoagie?
207112,L324923,u6112,m405,JAKE,What?
207113,L324922,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,How long have you known Hoagie?
207114,L324921,u6112,m405,JAKE,Shit....
207115,L324920,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What she's got.  Nine knots....
207116,L324919,u6112,m405,JAKE,What are we getting out of this old bucket?
207117,L324884,u6112,m405,JAKE,So far..
207118,L324883,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,And it's always worked?
207119,L324882,u6112,m405,JAKE,Lots of times....
207120,L324881,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,You sure you've done this before?
207121,L324854,u6112,m405,JAKE,You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
207122,L324853,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I don't know shit about electronics....
207123,L324849,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,So did I....
207124,L324848,u6112,m405,JAKE,I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
207125,L324847,u6112,m405,JAKE,The shark will get it for us.
207126,L324846,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you...."
207127,L324845,u6112,m405,JAKE,"We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away."
207128,L324844,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
207129,L324843,u6112,m405,JAKE,Okay...we got it together....
207130,L324842,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"We got it together, Jake...."
207131,L324841,u6112,m405,JAKE,When I invited you...
207132,L324840,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,When I signed on....
207133,L324839,u6112,m405,JAKE,When I got the grant.....
207134,L324838,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,When we got the grant....
207135,L324837,u6112,m405,JAKE,"Okay.. .we're done, man...."
207136,L324836,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,We don't write up anything until we're done....
207137,L324835,u6112,m405,JAKE,"We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?"
207138,L324833,u6112,m405,JAKE,"As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch...."
207139,L324832,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
207140,L324831,u6112,m405,JAKE,Gave them the day off....
207141,L324830,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,What happened to Clarence and...?
207142,L324828,u6112,m405,JAKE,Down here....

207144,L324729,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Don't say anything about this to my mother....
207145,L324728,u6112,m405,JAKE,"You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research...."
207146,L324704,u6112,m405,JAKE,Holy shit!
207147,L324703,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor...."
207148,L324702,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Spade's a garden tool....
207149,L324701,u6112,m405,JAKE,What?
207150,L324700,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I wish you wouldn't say that....
207151,L324698,u6112,m405,JAKE,I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
207152,L324697,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me...."
207153,L324696,u6112,m405,JAKE,Stop busting my hump....
207154,L324695,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,How many?
207155,L324642,u6112,m405,JAKE,You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
207156,L324641,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
207157,L324638,u6112,m405,JAKE,You're afraid of the competition out there....
207158,L324637,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"It's not a bad life, Jake...."
207159,L324636,u6112,m405,JAKE,"A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot...."
207160,L324631,u6112,m405,JAKE,I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
207161,L324630,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,They put bombs on dolphins....
207162,L324629,u6112,m405,JAKE,Money is money....
207163,L324628,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Forget it....
207164,L324627,u6112,m405,JAKE,Office of Naval Research has some money....
207165,L324526,u6112,m405,JAKE,May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
207166,L324525,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Sharp shirt, Jake...."
207167,L324520,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I didn't do it on purpose....
207168,L324519,u6112,m405,JAKE,Bad boy....
207169,L324504,u6112,m405,JAKE,Where the hell's the beer...?
207170,L324503,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Maybe I missed you too....
207171,L324502,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Put me down, damnit...."
207172,L324501,u6112,m405,JAKE,They won't fight with me....
207173,L324500,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Put me down....
207174,L324499,u6112,m405,JAKE,"I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne...."
207175,L324497,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"Yeah, well, just stop yelling."
207176,L324496,u6112,m405,JAKE,Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
207177,L324495,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Hey!
207178,L324494,u6112,m405,JAKE,You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
207179,L324493,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
207180,L324492,u6112,m405,JAKE,A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
207181,L324491,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak...."
207182,L324490,u6112,m405,JAKE,You didn't stick them on right....
207183,L324489,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"I stuck them on, man...."
207184,L324488,u6112,m405,JAKE,"I made them, man...."
207185,L324487,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Maybe it's the tags that suck....
207186,L324486,u6112,m405,JAKE,The readings suck....
207187,L324485,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I know how to tag a damn conch....
207188,L324463,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,"If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done...."
207189,L324462,u6112,m405,JAKE,"If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems...."
207190,L324461,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
207191,L324460,u6112,m405,JAKE,We'll pass around cigars....
207192,L324459,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,The females have eggs....
207193,L324458,u6112,m405,JAKE,"You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man...."
207194,L324457,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
207195,L324456,u6112,m405,JAKE,You tagging them...?
207196,L324455,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Will you leave me alone...?
207197,L324454,u6112,m405,JAKE,How many...?
207198,L324452,u6112,m405,JAKE,Try the area around the wreck....
207199,L324451,u6114,m405,MICHAEL,Stop busting my hump....
207200,L324450,u6112,m405,JAKE,Stop farting around....
207201,L324793,u6112,m405,JAKE,You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
207202,L324792,u6113,m405,LOUISA,When he has a pillow over his head....
207203,L324791,u6112,m405,JAKE,Woman has taste....
207204,L324784,u6113,m405,LOUISA,I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
207205,L324783,u6112,m405,JAKE,Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
207206,L324782,u6113,m405,LOUISA,I'm training to....
207207,L324781,u6112,m405,JAKE,She's in management....
207208,L324778,u6113,m405,LOUISA,I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
207209,L324777,u6112,m405,JAKE,I just want to make an honest woman of you....
207210,L324776,u6113,m405,LOUISA,Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
207211,L324775,u6112,m405,JAKE,"Happy birthday, darling. ..."
207212,L324774,u6113,m405,LOUISA,"Oh, Jake..."

207214,L324772,u6113,m405,LOUISA,I told you....
207215,L324771,u6112,m405,JAKE,More beautiful with each passing minute...
207216,L324770,u6113,m405,LOUISA,Here comes the cow ca-ca....
207217,L324769,u6112,m405,JAKE,Who grows more beautiful....
207218,L324768,u6113,m405,LOUISA,Here it comes....
207219,L324767,u6112,m405,JAKE,I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
207220,L324742,u6113,m405,LOUISA,In a few minutes....
207221,L324741,u6112,m405,JAKE,How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
207222,L324532,u6113,m405,LOUISA,Don't flatter yourself....
207223,L324531,u6112,m405,JAKE,"Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad...."
207224,L324254,u6115,m405,POLLY,Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
207225,L324253,u6116,m405,SEAN,I'll take care of it.
207226,L324252,u6115,m405,POLLY,Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
207227,L324251,u6116,m405,SEAN,Cow tipping?
207228,L324250,u6115,m405,POLLY,Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
207229,L324249,u6116,m405,SEAN,Where's Lenny?
207230,L324244,u6116,m405,SEAN,"Good night, Polly...."
207231,L324243,u6115,m405,POLLY,That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
207232,L324242,u6116,m405,SEAN,Anything to do before I go home?
207233,L324241,u6115,m405,POLLY,"You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow...."
207234,L324240,u6115,m405,POLLY,We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
207235,L324239,u6116,m405,SEAN,"That bad, huh?"
207236,L325691,u6118,m406,JACK,"Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ..."
207237,L325690,u6119,m406,MOTHER,"Oh, no. I wouldn't go ..."
207238,L325689,u6118,m406,JACK,"Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?"
207239,L325688,u6119,m406,MOTHER,Yeah?
207240,L325687,u6118,m406,JACK,"What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island."
207241,L325686,u6119,m406,MOTHER,"No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-"
207242,L325685,u6118,m406,JACK,"Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes."
207243,L325684,u6119,m406,MOTHER,Oh no--
207244,L325683,u6118,m406,JACK,"You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you."
207245,L325682,u6119,m406,MOTHER,What?
207246,L325681,u6118,m406,JACK,"I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?"
207247,L325680,u6119,m406,MOTHER,Yes.
207248,L325679,u6118,m406,JACK,"Did you like that, Mama?"
207249,L326446,u6120,m407,AMANDA,We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
207250,L326445,u6121,m407,BERLIN,How about any guys on your staff?
207251,L326444,u6120,m407,AMANDA,Only me and Mom ..
207252,L326443,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?"
207253,L326442,u6120,m407,AMANDA,"No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat."
207254,L326441,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Is it your vehicle?
207255,L326440,u6120,m407,AMANDA,The van?
207256,L326439,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"I'm afraid it's the ""van"" again."
207257,L326438,u6120,m407,AMANDA,"As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?"
207258,L326274,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living .."
207259,L326273,u6127,m407,ROSS,You ain't going in alone?
207260,L326272,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down."
207261,L326271,u6121,m407,BERLIN,We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
207262,L326270,u6127,m407,ROSS,What if we need a back up?
207263,L326269,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>."
207264,L326268,u6127,m407,ROSS,Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
207265,L326267,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"What d'you mean, ""bits."""
207266,L326266,u6127,m407,ROSS,Bits.
207267,L326265,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
207268,L326264,u6127,m407,ROSS,It's twenty of three.
207269,L326263,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I guess by the bed.
207270,L326262,u6127,m407,ROSS,Where's your watch?
207271,L326261,u6127,m407,ROSS,Hey ..
207272,L326260,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Listen, you don't havta come?"
207273,L326258,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"This ""cop"" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas."
207274,L326257,u6127,m407,ROSS,Now?
207275,L326256,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I'm going up to the institute.
207276,L326255,u6127,m407,ROSS,"What exactly you doing, John?"
207277,L326253,u6127,m407,ROSS,I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
207278,L326252,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Jesus. What are you doin?
207279,L326235,u6121,m407,BERLIN,That's just what I wanna find out.
207280,L326234,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?"
207281,L326233,u6121,m407,BERLIN,You got a quiet phone somewhere?
207282,L326228,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Are you sure you didn't call?
207283,L326227,u6127,m407,ROSS,Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
207284,L326209,u6127,m407,ROSS,Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
207285,L326208,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Can't thank you enough, Ross .."
207286,L326198,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
207287,L326197,u6127,m407,ROSS,What about Citrine?
207288,L326196,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
207289,L326195,u6127,m407,ROSS,I dunno what I can do to help you?
207290,L326194,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me .."
207291,L326193,u6127,m407,ROSS,Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
207292,L326192,u6121,m407,BERLIN,<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
207293,L326191,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Ease off, John .."
207294,L326190,u6121,m407,BERLIN,How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
207295,L326189,u6127,m407,ROSS,I'm asking it.
207296,L326188,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"That's a very stupid question, Ross."
207297,L326186,u6121,m407,BERLIN,No .. You didn't know that ..
207298,L326185,u6127,m407,ROSS,Well .. I didn't know that ..
207299,L326184,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the ""committee?"""
207300,L326183,u6127,m407,ROSS,You don't really believe this?
207301,L326182,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
207302,L326181,u6127,m407,ROSS,"I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? ""Good-bye, Princess,"" & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?"
207303,L326180,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
207304,L326141,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my ""Nervous Tick"" ..."
207305,L326140,u6127,m407,ROSS,You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
207306,L326139,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Sure.

207320,L326053,u6127,m407,ROSS,"No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day."

207327,L325988,u6127,m407,ROSS,What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
207328,L325987,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"You believe me, don't you?"
207329,L325985,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I was wrong.
207330,L325984,u6127,m407,ROSS,That isn't what you said before.

207335,L325979,u6121,m407,BERLIN,That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
207336,L325978,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this."
207337,L325977,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity."
207338,L325976,u6127,m407,ROSS,"How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over ""Jennifer"" for months?"
207339,L325975,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head."

207341,L325968,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
207342,L325967,u6127,m407,ROSS,It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
207343,L325966,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! .."
207344,L325965,u6127,m407,ROSS,To throw out of the window.

207348,L325961,u6127,m407,ROSS,I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
207349,L325960,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Why?
207350,L325959,u6127,m407,ROSS,Then give me that Zippo.

207355,L325954,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
207356,L325953,u6127,m407,ROSS,Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
207357,L325952,u6121,m407,BERLIN,We're going.
207358,L325951,u6127,m407,ROSS,"No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll."
207359,L325950,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump .."
207360,L325949,u6127,m407,ROSS,"No, you didn't."
207361,L325948,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
207362,L325926,u6127,m407,ROSS,"<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?"
207363,L325925,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
207364,L325924,u6127,m407,ROSS,Thank Christ we got a witness.
207365,L325923,u6121,m407,BERLIN,This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
207366,L325911,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
207367,L325910,u6127,m407,ROSS,Where is everyone?
207368,L325894,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> .."
207369,L325893,u6127,m407,ROSS,Pig Woman agreed to take a test.

207371,L325889,u6121,m407,BERLIN,O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
207372,L325888,u6127,m407,ROSS,Because I dislike her too much ..

207374,L325886,u6127,m407,ROSS,Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
207375,L325885,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"What do you mean, Ross?"
207376,L325884,u6127,m407,ROSS,Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
207377,L325883,u6121,m407,BERLIN,What do you mean?
207378,L325852,u6121,m407,BERLIN,A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..

207386,L325841,u6127,m407,ROSS,You want my advice?
207387,L325840,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
207388,L325839,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?"
207389,L325838,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 .."
207390,L325836,u6121,m407,BERLIN,It's a method for quitting smoking.
207391,L325835,u6127,m407,ROSS,"He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?"
207392,L325834,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I already did. What's his problem?
207393,L325833,u6127,m407,ROSS,"It's an ""unsolved."" They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case."

207395,L325830,u6121,m407,BERLIN,There's nothing in the files?
207396,L325829,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Because, don't get into it ..."
207397,L325828,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Why so coy about the word ""frozen""?"
207398,L325827,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Seven thirty-five .. Here, ""Town Gets Top Cop."" I was gonna pin it to your wall."
207399,L325826,u6121,m407,BERLIN,What time is it?
207400,L325816,u6127,m407,ROSS,"C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is ""God's Country,"" John."

207411,L325762,u6127,m407,ROSS,Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
207412,L325761,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Yeah, he can go ..."
207413,L325755,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Two dogs. He should do the dogs.

207415,L325753,u6121,m407,BERLIN,We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?

207417,L325750,u6127,m407,ROSS,What do you think?
207418,L325745,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?"

207420,L325743,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months."
207421,L325742,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?"
207422,L325731,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..

207428,L325717,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife."
207429,L325716,u6127,m407,ROSS,Be my guest. What you got?
207430,L325715,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I hope I'm not intruding?

207447,L326108,u6123,m407,CITRINE,Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
207448,L326107,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
207449,L326106,u6123,m407,CITRINE,"I'm shutting you down on this ""blind thing,"" John."
207450,L326046,u6123,m407,CITRINE,We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!

207452,L326044,u6123,m407,CITRINE,"I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part .."
207453,L326043,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"If you're not gonna hear me, Chief .."

207455,L326041,u6121,m407,BERLIN,It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
207456,L326040,u6123,m407,CITRINE,It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
207457,L326039,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"No, Sir."

207460,L326036,u6123,m407,CITRINE,Have you got a match on the bullet?
207461,L326035,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow."

207463,L326033,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
207464,L326032,u6123,m407,CITRINE,"You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?"
207465,L325877,u6123,m407,CITRINE,"I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this .."
207466,L325876,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"What do you want me to do, Chief?"
207467,L325875,u6123,m407,CITRINE,Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
207468,L325874,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I thought it was Taylor's case?
207469,L325873,u6123,m407,CITRINE,Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.
207470,L325869,u6123,m407,CITRINE,"Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?"
207471,L325868,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
207472,L325867,u6123,m407,CITRINE,I don't see that at all ..
207473,L325866,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think ""Jennifer,"" and this lady got hit by the same guy?"
207474,L325865,u6123,m407,CITRINE,What is all this Jennifer stuff?
207475,L325864,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
207476,L325863,u6123,m407,CITRINE,How do you know her hair's black?
207477,L325862,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?"
207478,L325861,u6123,m407,CITRINE,What is that?
207479,L325788,u6123,m407,CITRINE,"That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone .."
207480,L325787,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Why did he ask if it was frozen?
207481,L325778,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Maybe he's lying to you?
207482,L325777,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,Kid told me he didn't take it?
207483,L325776,u6121,m407,BERLIN,No .. But we have a theory ..
207484,L325775,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,"Did you find the knife, Sergeant?"
207485,L325772,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
207486,L325771,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
207487,L325770,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,Did he get you the job?
207488,L325767,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,"Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June."
207489,L325766,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Is this normal?
207490,L325741,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,"Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T .."
207491,L325740,u6121,m407,BERLIN,My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
207492,L325739,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,"Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?"
207493,L325733,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one."
207494,L325732,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,"What does that mean, Sergeant?"
207495,L325729,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
207496,L325728,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
207497,L326425,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>."
207498,L326424,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,I've heard you call him Freddy.
207499,L326423,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross ""Freddy"" in my life .."
207500,L326413,u6121,m407,BERLIN,He ain't offerin me shit.
207501,L326412,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
207502,L326178,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,"Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat."
207503,L326177,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"I know what a ""witness"" is."
207504,L326176,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,"<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago .."
207505,L326175,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"You don't know what you done, Taylor."
207506,L326169,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Just walk away from me, Taylor .."
207507,L326168,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,"Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert."
207508,L326167,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried .."
207509,L326166,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,Bullshit.
207510,L326165,u6121,m407,BERLIN,So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
207511,L326164,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,"Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?"
207512,L326163,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!"
207513,L326162,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
207514,L326161,u6121,m407,BERLIN,<u>You</u> put it in there.
207515,L326160,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,"His blind friend got ""attacked."" Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper."
207516,L326145,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,Wrong cabinet.
207517,L326144,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Vehicle references.
207518,L326143,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,What are you looking for?
207519,L326142,u6121,m407,BERLIN,".. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J .."
207520,L326130,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere .."
207521,L326129,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,"Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John .."
207522,L325909,u6124,m407,GOODRIDGE,"I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her .."
207523,L325908,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with."
207524,L325907,u6124,m407,GOODRIDGE,"As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?"
207525,L325906,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Yes, Sir."
207526,L325899,u6124,m407,GOODRIDGE,"Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there."
207527,L325898,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
207528,L325897,u6124,m407,GOODRIDGE,"Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?"
207529,L325896,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for .."
207530,L325895,u6124,m407,GOODRIDGE,As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
207531,L326421,u6121,m407,BERLIN,It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
207532,L326420,u6125,m407,HELENA,I don't want them to arrest you.
207533,L326419,u6121,m407,BERLIN,I think they're gonna arrest me.
207534,L326418,u6125,m407,HELENA,I wanna be near you ...
207535,L326417,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart .."
207536,L326408,u6125,m407,HELENA,I'm blind because my father drank.
207537,L326407,u6121,m407,BERLIN,You do?
207538,L326406,u6125,m407,HELENA,"I know about alcohol, John."
207539,L326405,u6121,m407,BERLIN,He doesn't need my help.
207540,L326397,u6125,m407,HELENA,Then why didn't he kill me?
207541,L326396,u6121,m407,BERLIN,He don't know that. I didn't.
207542,L326395,u6125,m407,HELENA,I can't identify him ..
207543,L326394,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Coz he thinks you're a witness.
207544,L326393,u6125,m407,HELENA,Why does he want to kill me?
207545,L326392,u6121,m407,BERLIN,The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
207546,L326391,u6125,m407,HELENA,"<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?"
207547,L326390,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand."
207548,L326389,u6125,m407,HELENA,Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
207549,L326294,u6121,m407,BERLIN,No .. not now ..
207550,L326293,u6125,m407,HELENA,I'm going back to the institute.
207551,L326292,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight."
207552,L326287,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
207553,L326286,u6125,m407,HELENA,Why?
207554,L326285,u6121,m407,BERLIN,It's not possible right now.
207555,L326284,u6125,m407,HELENA,Why can't I stay with you?
207556,L326205,u6125,m407,HELENA,"Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back .."
207557,L326204,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"You're looking more worried now than when you ""decided to stop worrying""?"
207558,L326203,u6125,m407,HELENA,No I'm not.
207559,L326202,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"You're looking worried again, Helena?"
207560,L326201,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?"
207561,L326200,u6125,m407,HELENA,I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
207562,L326199,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Has he got your aunt's address?
207563,L326150,u6125,m407,HELENA,Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
207564,L326149,u6121,m407,BERLIN,You know? How do you know?
207565,L326148,u6125,m407,HELENA,I know.

207571,L326098,u6125,m407,HELENA,He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
207572,L326097,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Really? What did he say?
207573,L326096,u6125,m407,HELENA,Ross told me.
207574,L326095,u6121,m407,BERLIN,How d'you know what I'm like?

207635,L325917,u6121,m407,BERLIN,You must have some idea about him.
207636,L325915,u6121,m407,BERLIN,What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
207637,L325914,u6125,m407,HELENA,"Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things .."
207638,L325913,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K."
207639,L325912,u6125,m407,HELENA,"What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?"
207640,L326308,u6129,m407,TRAVIS,The man from the F.B.I.
207641,L326307,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Who sought the warrant?
207642,L326306,u6129,m407,TRAVIS,"Yes, Sir."
207643,L326305,u6121,m407,BERLIN,You got a warrant for this?
207644,L326304,u6129,m407,TRAVIS,"I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy."
207645,L326303,u6121,m407,BERLIN,Why?
207646,L326302,u6129,m407,TRAVIS,"I been told to take your car in, Sir."
207647,L326301,u6121,m407,BERLIN,"What are you doing, Travis?"
207648,L325786,u6123,m407,CITRINE,"Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it .."
207649,L325785,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,"Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?"
207650,L325784,u6123,m407,CITRINE,"Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about .."
207651,L325783,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,"Grateful for your candor, Sir."
207652,L325782,u6123,m407,CITRINE,.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
207653,L325781,u6122,m407,BLATTIS,"C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes .."
207654,L325780,u6123,m407,CITRINE,"Interview over, Blattis ..."
207655,L325905,u6124,m407,GOODRIDGE,"No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either .."
207656,L325904,u6127,m407,ROSS,And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
207657,L325903,u6124,m407,GOODRIDGE,"Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't ""blind"" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left .."
207658,L325902,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Yeah, I guess I do."
207659,L325901,u6124,m407,GOODRIDGE,You find something curious in that?
207660,L325900,u6127,m407,ROSS,"A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?"
207661,L326289,u6126,m407,MARGIE,"I'm here, honey. I'm right here."
207662,L326288,u6125,m407,HELENA,Is that Margie?
207663,L326237,u6125,m407,HELENA,Don't mix very well with beer.
207664,L326236,u6126,m407,MARGIE,How you doing on those shoes?
207665,L326222,u6126,m407,MARGIE,"I think John, would <u>love</u> it ..."
207666,L326221,u6125,m407,HELENA,You think John would like it?
207667,L326220,u6126,m407,MARGIE,"Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still .."
207668,L326219,u6125,m407,HELENA,I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
207669,L326218,u6126,m407,MARGIE,Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
207670,L326217,u6125,m407,HELENA,You think he still loves her?
207671,L326216,u6126,m407,MARGIE,"You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank .."
207672,L326215,u6125,m407,HELENA,What does that mean?
207673,L326214,u6126,m407,MARGIE,"Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet."
207674,L326213,u6125,m407,HELENA,What was she like?
207675,L326212,u6126,m407,MARGIE,Two or three years ago.
207676,L326211,u6125,m407,HELENA,When did John divorce?
207677,L326083,u6127,m407,ROSS,Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
207678,L326082,u6126,m407,MARGIE,He's not that bad of a guy ..?
207679,L326081,u6127,m407,ROSS,She married some English prick.
207680,L326077,u6127,m407,ROSS,I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
207681,L326076,u6126,m407,MARGIE,"You want something, darling?"
207682,L326075,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away."
207683,L326074,u6126,m407,MARGIE,"Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?"
207684,L326073,u6127,m407,ROSS,"I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the ""element"" is a bad idea."
207685,L326072,u6126,m407,MARGIE,"He's happy, darlin .."
207686,L326071,u6127,m407,ROSS,She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
207687,L326070,u6126,m407,MARGIE,Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
207688,L325808,u6127,m407,ROSS,Even better.
207689,L325807,u6126,m407,MARGIE,No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
207690,L325804,u6127,m407,ROSS,Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
207691,L325803,u6126,m407,MARGIE,So tonight she confesses?

207693,L325799,u6127,m407,ROSS,Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
207694,L325798,u6126,m407,MARGIE,Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
207695,L325797,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour .."
207696,L325796,u6126,m407,MARGIE,I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
207697,L326174,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,"No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off."
207698,L326173,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Shut up, King Jay .."
207699,L326172,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,"He tells her, ""bye-bye,"" and she gets ""attacked."" Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no ""Ser- ial Killer.""

207701,L326170,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
207702,L326159,u6127,m407,ROSS,Whass going on here?
207703,L326158,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,"Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant .."
207704,L326127,u6128,m407,TAYLOR,"No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor."

207706,L325760,u6127,m407,ROSS,Ask him.

207708,L325748,u6129,m407,TRAVIS,I think I've found a hand.

207713,L325720,u6129,m407,TRAVIS,I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
207714,L325711,u6129,m407,TRAVIS,"His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body."
207715,L325710,u6127,m407,ROSS,"Where do you fit in, Trimble?"
207716,L325706,u6129,m407,TRAVIS,A derelict.

207767,L326778,u6130,m408,AVERY,"Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire."
207768,L326777,u6136,m408,JERRY,I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
207769,L326776,u6130,m408,AVERY,"Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you."
207770,L326775,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44."

207781,L326613,u6130,m408,AVERY,"Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!"
207782,L326612,u6136,m408,JERRY,Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
207783,L326611,u6130,m408,AVERY,Don't ever stop fucking me!

207787,L327142,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense."
207788,L327141,u6131,m408,CHAD,"Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz."
207789,L327140,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Don't let him stay up too late.
207790,L326829,u6131,m408,CHAD,"Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50."
207791,L326828,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Wait.  Did I just say ""hon"" to him?"
207792,L326908,u6132,m408,CUSH,"Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered."
207793,L326907,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Just be friendly and say ""no comment."""

207800,L326854,u6132,m408,CUSH,I see what you're saying.
207801,L326853,u6136,m408,JERRY,Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
207802,L327253,u6133,m408,DOOLER,Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
207803,L327252,u6136,m408,JERRY,Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
207804,L327247,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Bill, Rod, wait --"
207805,L327246,u6133,m408,DOOLER,"Look, Rod, just get on the camel!"
207806,L326636,u6133,m408,DOOLER,"They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong."
207807,L326635,u6136,m408,JERRY,... this is... uh... too funny...
207808,L326627,u6136,m408,JERRY,You're imagining it.
207809,L326626,u6133,m408,DOOLER,"This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming."
207810,L326625,u6136,m408,JERRY,Oh come on --
207811,L326624,u6133,m408,DOOLER,"You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party."
207812,L327456,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130."
207813,L327455,u6136,m408,JERRY,"This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me."
207814,L327392,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118."
207815,L327391,u6136,m408,JERRY,So this break... is a break-up.
207816,L327390,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
207817,L327389,u6136,m408,JERRY,What about Ray?
207818,L327388,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, ""responsible""... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break."
207819,L327387,u6136,m408,JERRY,I don't like to give up.
207820,L327386,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
207821,L327385,u6136,m408,JERRY,"What if it's true?  ""Great at friendship bad at intimacy."" I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --"
207822,L327384,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,I think we made a mistake here.
207823,L327383,u6136,m408,JERRY,Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
207824,L327382,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
207825,L327381,u6136,m408,JERRY,...my soul or something. _ 117.
207826,L327380,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,I don't know --
207827,L327379,u6136,m408,JERRY,You want...
207828,L327378,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"I don't need you to ""stick."""
207829,L327377,u6136,m408,JERRY,Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
207830,L327376,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now."
207831,L327375,u6136,m408,JERRY,Tell me -- let me help --
207832,L327374,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,It's not fair to you.  This whole --
207833,L327373,u6136,m408,JERRY,What --
207834,L327372,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,It's my fault.
207835,L327368,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Why do you love me?
207836,L327367,u6136,m408,JERRY,Why do you love me?
207837,L327366,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Okay... I will...
207838,L327365,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Well, when you wonder, ask me."
207839,L327364,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,And I really don't know your noises yet.
207840,L327363,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours."
207841,L327362,u6136,m408,JERRY,I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
207842,L327300,u6136,m408,JERRY,Will you marry me?
207843,L327299,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
207844,L327298,u6136,m408,JERRY,"If I said that, would you stay?"
207845,L327293,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it."
207846,L327292,u6136,m408,JERRY,What --
207847,L327289,u6136,m408,JERRY,So I'll see you this weekend.
207848,L327288,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,This rig? Phht.  No problem.
207849,L327287,u6136,m408,JERRY,Sure you're okay to drive this?
207850,L327227,u6136,m408,JERRY,And I appreciate that impulse.
207851,L327226,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Fine, I just --"
207852,L327225,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Another time, okay Dorothy?"
207853,L327201,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Easy, easy --"
207854,L327200,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Oh God.
207855,L327179,u6136,m408,JERRY,Oh hell yes.
207856,L327178,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
207857,L327177,u6136,m408,JERRY,Right.  I'll come in.
207858,L327176,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
207859,L327175,u6136,m408,JERRY,Same to you.
207860,L327174,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel."
207861,L327171,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Good night.
207862,L327170,u6136,m408,JERRY,Well -- this would be goodnight.
207863,L327166,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Let's not tell our sad stories.
207864,L327165,u6136,m408,JERRY,What?
207865,L327164,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?"
207866,L327160,u6136,m408,JERRY,"No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?"
207867,L327159,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Maybe you should call her.
207868,L327154,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --"
207869,L327153,u6136,m408,JERRY,"It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, ""it's nobody's fault."" It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --"
207870,L327146,u6136,m408,JERRY,Bye you guys. _ 88.
207871,L327145,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"We'll see you soon, honey. Bye."
207872,L327139,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were..."
207873,L327138,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
207874,L327137,u6136,m408,JERRY,Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
207875,L327130,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
207876,L327129,u6136,m408,JERRY,"You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that."
207877,L327128,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Oh good.
207878,L327127,u6136,m408,JERRY,"I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again."
207879,L327126,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,I'm relieved you said that.
207880,L327125,u6136,m408,JERRY,We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
207881,L327124,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Yeah, what happened there."
207882,L327123,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Look, the other night, I want to apologize."
207883,L327122,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,You don't have to explain.
207884,L327121,u6136,m408,JERRY,"I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --"
207885,L327120,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Plus, you could use that commission."
207886,L327119,u6136,m408,JERRY,Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
207887,L327118,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Actually he said ""glad."" _ 85."
207888,L327117,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Happy. He said ""happy?"""
207889,L327116,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy."
207890,L327078,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Good evening.
207891,L327077,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Well, good evening."
207892,L327076,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,I may not sue.
207893,L327075,u6136,m408,JERRY,"No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now."
207894,L327074,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
207895,L327073,u6136,m408,JERRY,Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
207896,L327072,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Yeah, I did."
207897,L327071,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Oh shit.  You said ""boss."""
207898,L327070,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Don't worry about it, boss."
207899,L327069,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?"
207900,L327068,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Well.
207901,L327067,u6136,m408,JERRY,Mission... statement...
207902,L327066,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,I'm working with you because of that memo...
207903,L327065,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
207904,L327064,u6136,m408,JERRY,Me too.
207905,L327062,u6136,m408,JERRY,Sure.
207906,L327061,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Truth?
207907,L327059,u6136,m408,JERRY,And I am...
207908,L327058,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,-- especially one like this.
207909,L327057,u6136,m408,JERRY,We will be fine!
207910,L327056,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
207911,L327050,u6136,m408,JERRY,Good idea.  Thank you.
207912,L327049,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab."
207913,L327019,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Yeah, thanks."
207914,L327018,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Beer okay?
207915,L327015,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Sure --
207916,L327014,u6136,m408,JERRY,Do you have something to drink?
207917,L327013,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too."
207918,L327012,u6136,m408,JERRY,And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
207919,L327011,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?"
207920,L327010,u6136,m408,JERRY,Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
207921,L327009,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Too bad.
207922,L327008,u6136,m408,JERRY,Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
207923,L327007,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Oh my God.
207924,L327006,u6136,m408,JERRY,"I'm glad you're home.  That ""alone"" thing is... not my specialty..."
207925,L327005,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
207926,L327004,u6136,m408,JERRY,Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
207927,L327003,u6136,m408,JERRY,Hi.
207928,L327002,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Hey you.
207929,L326847,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck."
207930,L326846,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?"
207931,L326827,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Call me later, hon."
207932,L326826,u6136,m408,JERRY,Thanks.
207933,L326825,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
207934,L326824,u6136,m408,JERRY,Happy for us.
207935,L326823,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Well, I'm happy for you."
207936,L326822,u6136,m408,JERRY,It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
207937,L326821,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,I just got goosebumps.
207938,L326820,u6136,m408,JERRY,It's all going to work.
207939,L326819,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,We are?
207940,L326818,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set."
207941,L326816,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --"
207942,L326815,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,... light.
207943,L326814,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is..."
207944,L326813,u6136,m408,JERRY,"No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?"
207945,L326812,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff."
207946,L326811,u6136,m408,JERRY,Hello?
207947,L326810,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait."
207948,L326753,u6136,m408,JERRY,Same to you.
207949,L326752,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,That took guts.
207950,L326749,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Absolutely.
207951,L326748,u6136,m408,JERRY,But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
207952,L326747,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"No no, I know --"
207953,L326746,u6136,m408,JERRY,Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
207954,L326745,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --"
207955,L326744,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know."
207956,L326743,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?"
207957,L326742,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said ""you complete me."" _ 40."
207958,L326741,u6136,m408,JERRY,Wonder what he said.
207959,L326606,u6136,m408,JERRY,Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
207960,L326605,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye."
207961,L326599,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"-- the part about ""we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm"" --"
207962,L326598,u6136,m408,JERRY,"I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and..."
207963,L326597,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Oh tsht. Yes.
207964,L326596,u6136,m408,JERRY,You think so?
207965,L326595,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act."
207966,L326592,u6136,m408,JERRY,"No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called ""my twenties."" See you later."
207967,L326591,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
207968,L326590,u6136,m408,JERRY,No no. I knew.
207969,L326589,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Oh no.
207970,L326588,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,And have fun at your bachelor party.
207971,L326587,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Well, take care."
207972,L326586,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Well, thanks."
207973,L326583,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,My son... my mind...
207974,L326582,u6136,m408,JERRY,Now what did you lose?
207975,L326581,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Hmm.  Pretty good.
207976,L326580,u6136,m408,JERRY,I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
207977,L326579,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
207978,L326578,u6136,m408,JERRY,Can I help?
207979,L326555,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Oh, tell the story."
207980,L326554,u6136,m408,JERRY,No no...
207981,L327198,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him."
207982,L327197,u6137,m408,LAUREL,"Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --"
207983,L327195,u6137,m408,LAUREL,Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
207984,L327194,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Please, if I start talking --"
207985,L327193,u6137,m408,LAUREL,"Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head."
207986,L327192,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,No--
207987,L327191,u6137,m408,LAUREL,First you gotta tell me something.
207988,L327151,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Oh, knock it off! _ 89."
207989,L327150,u6137,m408,LAUREL,No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
207990,L327149,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that."
207991,L327148,u6137,m408,LAUREL,Forgot your keys --
207992,L327035,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Thanks.
207993,L327034,u6137,m408,LAUREL,Good.
207994,L327033,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?"
207995,L327027,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,As opposed to twenty angry women?
207996,L327026,u6137,m408,LAUREL,But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
207997,L327025,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,That's the girl I love.
207998,L327024,u6137,m408,LAUREL,"Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74."
207999,L327023,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Thank you.
208000,L327022,u6137,m408,LAUREL,This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
208001,L327021,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
208002,L327020,u6137,m408,LAUREL,I heard.
208003,L326994,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in."
208004,L326993,u6137,m408,LAUREL,"Dotty -- this is not ""guy."". This is a ""syndrome.""  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you."
208005,L326992,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
208006,L326991,u6137,m408,LAUREL,At eleven at night? _ 70.
208007,L326990,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,He's coming over.
208008,L326764,u6137,m408,LAUREL,He's in the living room asleep.
208009,L326763,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Wait. Where is he?
208010,L326760,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,Of course I know --
208011,L326759,u6137,m408,LAUREL,You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
208012,L326758,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too."
208013,L326757,u6137,m408,LAUREL,You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
208014,L326756,u6134,m408,DOROTHY,"Of course, medical! _ 42."
208015,L326755,u6137,m408,LAUREL,What about medical?
208016,L327467,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it..."
208017,L327466,u6135,m408,FIRESTONE,"Ten seconds, Rod."
208018,L327465,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan."
208019,L327462,u6135,m408,FIRESTONE,"It's only a half-hour show, Rod."
208020,L327461,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?"
208021,L327460,u6135,m408,FIRESTONE,"-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up."
208022,L327459,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry."
208023,L326928,u6139,m408,MATT,We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
208024,L326927,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your ""my word is stronger'n oak"" thing --"
208025,L326922,u6136,m408,JERRY,I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
208026,L326921,u6139,m408,MATT,"I'm sorry, I --"
208027,L326920,u6136,m408,JERRY,So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
208028,L326919,u6139,m408,MATT,"Hey, I'm learning as I go."
208029,L326918,u6136,m408,JERRY,Said who?  Sugar?
208030,L326917,u6139,m408,MATT,"Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you."
208031,L326916,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?"
208032,L326915,u6139,m408,MATT,"Not right now, Jerry."
208033,L326903,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million."
208034,L326902,u6139,m408,MATT,What happened to Denver?
208035,L326804,u6139,m408,MATT,"You know I don't do ""contracts."" But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak."
208036,L326803,u6136,m408,JERRY,I'll give it everything.
208037,L326802,u6139,m408,MATT,Denver is where he should be.
208038,L326800,u6136,m408,JERRY,It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
208039,L326799,u6139,m408,MATT,"I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play."
208040,L326797,u6136,m408,JERRY,"You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go."
208041,L326796,u6139,m408,MATT,"Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him."
208042,L326795,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Oh, thank you."
208043,L326794,u6139,m408,MATT,We decided to stay with you.
208044,L326793,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --"
208045,L327411,u6136,m408,JERRY,I missed ya.  What can I say?
208046,L327410,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Thanks for coming.
208047,L327409,u6136,m408,JERRY,Go.  Flee.
208048,L327408,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Jerry!  You made it --
208049,L327354,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
208050,L327353,u6136,m408,JERRY,We still having dinner in L.A.?
208051,L327352,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Beautiful.
208052,L327351,u6136,m408,JERRY,Fine.
208053,L327350,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,I don't want to be friends anymore.
208054,L327349,u6136,m408,JERRY,Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
208055,L327348,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,I think so.
208056,L327347,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our ""friends"" hats on --"
208057,L327346,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Why not --
208058,L327345,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really ""friends?"""
208059,L327344,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married."
208060,L327343,u6136,m408,JERRY,Damn right.
208061,L327342,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,That's an answer.
208062,L327341,u6136,m408,JERRY,"No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there."
208063,L327340,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,I'm sorry I asked.
208064,L327339,u6136,m408,JERRY,You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
208065,L327338,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
208066,L327337,u6136,m408,JERRY,Not everyone has what you have.
208067,L327336,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
208068,L327335,u6136,m408,JERRY,"No, you're --"
208069,L327334,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,I'm asking you a question --
208070,L327333,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Why are you doing this to me, Rod?"
208071,L327332,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"You don't want to go home, do you?"
208072,L327331,u6136,m408,JERRY,"I don't know -- how's ""dedication"" for an answer?"
208073,L327330,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone."
208074,L327329,u6136,m408,JERRY,What's that supposed to mean?
208075,L327328,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
208076,L327327,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster."
208077,L327326,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers."
208078,L327324,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Hey, that's my word, okay?"
208079,L327323,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan."
208080,L327322,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,No.
208081,L327321,u6136,m408,JERRY,"We can still take the offer, Rod."
208082,L327318,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
208083,L327317,u6136,m408,JERRY,I'm a little worried --
208084,L327316,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed."
208085,L327309,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Well, this was another way to go."
208086,L327308,u6136,m408,JERRY,No.
208087,L327307,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"You never had The Talk, did you?"
208088,L327270,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
208089,L327269,u6136,m408,JERRY,"I didn't ""shoplift the pooty.""  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty."
208090,L327268,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"No.  A real man does not shoplift the ""pooty"" from a single mom."
208091,L327267,u6136,m408,JERRY,The kid is amazing.
208092,L327266,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103."
208093,L327265,u6136,m408,JERRY,But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
208094,L327264,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Then you gotta have The Talk.
208095,L327263,u6136,m408,JERRY,"No, I don't know."
208096,L327262,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?"
208097,L327261,u6136,m408,JERRY,How do I know?
208098,L327260,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"First, single mothers don't ""date."" They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?"
208099,L327259,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego."
208100,L327258,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
208101,L327257,u6136,m408,JERRY,What do you know about dating a single mother?
208102,L327256,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Oh, we gonna be friends now?"
208103,L327255,u6136,m408,JERRY,Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
208104,L327249,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Rod, get on the camel."
208105,L327248,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME."
208106,L327239,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Good deal, man."
208107,L327238,u6136,m408,JERRY,I'll get you some quick work --
208108,L327236,u6136,m408,JERRY,It's a risk.
208109,L327235,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
208110,L327234,u6136,m408,JERRY,"If you get injured, you get nothing."
208111,L327113,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you."
208112,L327112,u6136,m408,JERRY,I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
208113,L327111,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,No tell me. _ 84.
208114,L327110,u6136,m408,JERRY,Forget it.  Forget it.
208115,L327109,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,What's wrong.
208116,L327107,u6136,m408,JERRY,Fine.
208117,L327106,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance."
208118,L327105,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?"
208119,L327104,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"""Love me love me love me... put me on t.v.""  That's the iconography of rascism, man!"
208120,L327103,u6136,m408,JERRY,"No, I'm saying to be --"
208121,L327102,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,You're telling me to dance.
208122,L327098,u6136,m408,JERRY,You.
208123,L327097,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Is that your porty or mine?
208124,L327096,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --"
208125,L327095,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"No, I air-dry."
208126,L327094,u6136,m408,JERRY,Great word.  Towel?
208127,L327093,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"I got there from ""coin,"" dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan."
208128,L327092,u6136,m408,JERRY,"But how did you get ""kwan?"" _ 82."
208129,L327091,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan."
208130,L327090,u6136,m408,JERRY,That's your word?
208131,L327089,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,--  the kwan.
208132,L327088,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the ""coin.""  It's the..."
208133,L327087,u6136,m408,JERRY,I understand your anxiety.
208134,L327086,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table."
208135,L327085,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Uh, not today, but --"
208136,L327084,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Did you tell him about the ""ten million for four years?"""
208137,L326989,u6136,m408,JERRY,Oh my God.
208138,L326988,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money."
208139,L326987,u6136,m408,JERRY,Another drink please.
208140,L326986,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your ""nya nya nya."""
208141,L326985,u6136,m408,JERRY,Why not?
208142,L326984,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,You are not allowed to act this way.
208143,L326983,u6136,m408,JERRY,It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
208144,L326982,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,No.
208145,L326981,u6136,m408,JERRY,The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
208146,L326980,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Well, boo-fucking-hoo."
208147,L326979,u6136,m408,JERRY,"See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on ""do not do this"" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!"
208148,L326978,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!"
208149,L326977,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Huh?
208150,L326976,u6136,m408,JERRY,"What are you doing with me, Rod?"
208151,L326975,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
208152,L326974,u6136,m408,JERRY,Rod --
208153,L326972,u6136,m408,JERRY,Very much.
208154,L326971,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"You love me now, don't you?"
208155,L326889,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,I might call you later!
208156,L326888,u6136,m408,JERRY,Call me tomorrow.
208157,L326887,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --"
208158,L326886,u6136,m408,JERRY,Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
208159,L326885,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
208160,L326884,u6136,m408,JERRY,"I'm not about love -- I'm about ""showing you the money."""
208161,L326883,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"You're loving me now, aren't ya?"
208162,L326881,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me..."
208163,L326880,u6136,m408,JERRY,I gotta get back to Cushman.
208164,L326879,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
208165,L326878,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Let's do it again.
208166,L326877,u6136,m408,JERRY,Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
208167,L326876,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
208168,L326868,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
208169,L326867,u6136,m408,JERRY,At last I find you.
208170,L326723,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
208171,L326722,u6136,m408,JERRY,Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
208172,L326721,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
208173,L326720,u6136,m408,JERRY,I got it.
208174,L326719,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Here it is.  ""Show me the money.""  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36."
208175,L326718,u6136,m408,JERRY,Yes.
208176,L326717,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?"
208177,L326716,u6136,m408,JERRY,Mmm.  Hmm.
208178,L326715,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?"
208179,L326710,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --"
208180,L326709,u6136,m408,JERRY,Now you want Arizona dollars.
208181,L326708,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain ""get killed, catch the ball."" That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!"
208182,L326707,u6136,m408,JERRY,Okay.
208183,L326706,u6143,m408,TIDWELL,"Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to."
208184,L326572,u6144,m408,WOMAN,Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
208185,L326571,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, ""Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me."" And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said ""yes"" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February."
208186,L326567,u6136,m408,JERRY,But wait...
208187,L326566,u6144,m408,WOMAN,How sad --
208188,L326565,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --"
208189,L326564,u6144,m408,WOMAN,Oh no -- _ 14.
208190,L326563,u6136,m408,JERRY,"To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- ""Hurry up, klutz."""
208191,L326562,u6144,m408,WOMAN,To the pools?
208192,L326561,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there."
208193,L326560,u6144,m408,WOMAN,"That's when you need to cement, and define define define."
208194,L326559,u6136,m408,JERRY,"A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months."
208195,L326558,u6144,m408,WOMAN,Gorgeous.
208196,L326557,u6136,m408,JERRY,"--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui..."
208197,L326556,u6144,m408,WOMAN,"Oh, tell the story."
208198,L326552,u6136,m408,JERRY,"She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now..."
208199,L326551,u6144,m408,WOMAN,"Tell me, and then you can sleep."
208200,L326550,u6136,m408,JERRY,I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
208201,L326549,u6144,m408,WOMAN,"It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee."
208202,L326548,u6136,m408,JERRY,I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
208203,L326547,u6144,m408,WOMAN,"And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?"
208204,L326544,u6136,m408,JERRY,Well.  Good luck with that --
208205,L326543,u6144,m408,WOMAN,Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
208206,L326542,u6136,m408,JERRY,Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
208207,L326541,u6144,m408,WOMAN,"You're with the sports people on the plane, right?"
208208,L326535,u6136,m408,JERRY,Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
208209,L326534,u6144,m408,WOMAN,What --
208210,L326533,u6136,m408,JERRY,I have to ask.
208211,L327432,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124."
208212,L327431,u6138,m408,MARCEE,"""Stay calm?""  I'm freakin..."
208213,L327430,u6136,m408,JERRY,Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
208214,L327429,u6138,m408,MARCEE,I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
208215,L327428,u6136,m408,JERRY,He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
208216,L327242,u6138,m408,MARCEE,My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
208217,L327241,u6136,m408,JERRY,Don't be silly.
208218,L327240,u6138,m408,MARCEE,I'm sorry what I said back there.
208219,L327220,u6138,m408,MARCEE,What DO you stand for???
208220,L327219,u6136,m408,JERRY,Marcee --
208221,L327218,u6138,m408,MARCEE,"What are you talking about -- ""don't get emotional."" If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98."
208222,L327217,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem."
208223,L327214,u6138,m408,MARCEE,"And say what?  ""Please remove your dick from my ass?!"""
208224,L327213,u6136,m408,JERRY,I'll go back to them.
208225,L326654,u6136,m408,JERRY,Damn right.
208226,L326653,u6138,m408,MARCEE,"Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!"
208227,L326652,u6136,m408,JERRY,"Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention."
208228,L326651,u6136,m408,JERRY,Not a chance.
208229,L326650,u6138,m408,MARCEE,You gonna get that --
208230,L326643,u6138,m408,MARCEE,"I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25."
208231,L326642,u6136,m408,JERRY,How can I make your life better?
208232,L326640,u6138,m408,MARCEE,"Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!"
208233,L326639,u6136,m408,JERRY,Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
208234,L326684,u6141,m408,SUGAR,I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
208235,L326683,u6136,m408,JERRY,"SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team..."
208236,L326677,u6141,m408,SUGAR,"You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --"

208240,L326673,u6141,m408,SUGAR,You wanted smaller.
208241,L326672,u6136,m408,JERRY,You'll lose.
208242,L326671,u6141,m408,SUGAR,Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
208243,L326670,u6136,m408,JERRY,Dick.
208244,L326669,u6141,m408,SUGAR,... dick?
208245,L326666,u6141,m408,SUGAR,"You did this to yourself.  You said ""fewer clients.""  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --"
208246,L326665,u6136,m408,JERRY,You...
208247,L326664,u6141,m408,SUGAR,I know.  It sucks.  I suck.

208266,L327206,u6140,m408,RAY,"What's going on, Jerry?"
208267,L327048,u6140,m408,RAY,Funny...   I better go to bed.

208279,L327036,u6140,m408,RAY,And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
208280,L327030,u6136,m408,JERRY,Hi Ray.

208306,L328982,u6149,m409,GRANT,"After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?"
208307,L328980,u6149,m409,GRANT,A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
208308,L328979,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids."
208309,L328931,u6149,m409,GRANT,And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
208310,L328930,u6145,m409,AMANDA,ERRR-IIIC!
208311,L329293,u6145,m409,AMANDA,I would completely support that.
208312,L329292,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age."
208313,L329272,u6145,m409,AMANDA,I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
208314,L329271,u6150,m409,PAUL,You mean it?
208315,L329270,u6145,m409,AMANDA,We should try fishing again.
208316,L329216,u6145,m409,AMANDA,But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
208317,L329215,u6150,m409,PAUL,He could have died.
208318,L329214,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us."
208319,L329213,u6150,m409,PAUL,"I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy."
208320,L329212,u6145,m409,AMANDA,You couldn't have made that jump.
208321,L329211,u6150,m409,PAUL,My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
208322,L329197,u6150,m409,PAUL,I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
208323,L329196,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
208324,L329184,u6150,m409,PAUL,"We're not going anywhere, I promise."
208325,L329183,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me."
208326,L329163,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?"
208327,L329162,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay."
208328,L329160,u6150,m409,PAUL,I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
208329,L329159,u6145,m409,AMANDA,What?...WHAT!?
208330,L329157,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Think.
208331,L329156,u6150,m409,PAUL,I don't remember
208332,L329155,u6145,m409,AMANDA,When did you have it last?
208333,L329154,u6150,m409,PAUL,I don't know. I don't have it with me.
208334,L329134,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here."
208335,L329133,u6150,m409,PAUL,That one time was just the bumper.
208336,L329132,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years."
208337,L329131,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it."
208338,L329130,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Well what?
208339,L329124,u6150,m409,PAUL,"I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?"
208340,L329123,u6145,m409,AMANDA,We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
208341,L329092,u6145,m409,AMANDA,We have to help him.
208342,L329091,u6150,m409,PAUL,It's not safe.
208343,L329090,u6145,m409,AMANDA,He's this way.
208344,L329089,u6150,m409,PAUL,Udesky.
208345,L329074,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Eric!
208346,L329073,u6150,m409,PAUL,Eric! Are you here?
208347,L329056,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
208348,L329055,u6150,m409,PAUL,I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
208349,L329054,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"No, it's..."
208350,L329053,u6150,m409,PAUL,I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
208351,L329042,u6145,m409,AMANDA,I filmed this the morning they left.
208352,L329041,u6150,m409,PAUL,That's him. Thats Eric!
208353,L329032,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Eric...
208354,L329031,u6150,m409,PAUL,Young adult.
208355,L329029,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Just drop it Paul!
208356,L329028,u6150,m409,PAUL,What did you say!
208357,L329027,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Nothing.
208358,L329026,u6150,m409,PAUL,What did you say?
208359,L329025,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Nothing.
208360,L329024,u6150,m409,PAUL,What?
208361,L329023,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"Oh, don't worry about that."
208362,L329022,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me."
208363,L329021,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"Because ""Dr. Grant"" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast."
208364,L329020,u6150,m409,PAUL,Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
208365,L329019,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that..."
208366,L329018,u6150,m409,PAUL,"No, Dr. Grant says..."
208367,L329017,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
208368,L329016,u6150,m409,PAUL,Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
208369,L328997,u6145,m409,AMANDA,So do you.
208370,L328996,u6150,m409,PAUL,You look good.
208371,L328995,u6150,m409,PAUL,People change.
208372,L328994,u6145,m409,AMANDA,You hate to swim.
208373,L328993,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y."
208374,L328992,u6145,m409,AMANDA,How much weight have you lost?
208375,L328991,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Nothing you haven't seen before.
208376,L328990,u6150,m409,PAUL,Sorry.
208377,L328970,u6150,m409,PAUL,"We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should ""accept the inevitable."" You believe that?"
208378,L328969,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back."
208379,L328968,u6150,m409,PAUL,Her new boyfriend.
208380,L328943,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back."
208381,L328942,u6145,m409,AMANDA,We can't just...
208382,L328935,u6145,m409,AMANDA,What's a bad idea?
208383,L328934,u6150,m409,PAUL,He says it's a bad idea!
208384,L328933,u6145,m409,AMANDA,What?
208385,L328932,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!"
208386,L328891,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want."
208387,L328890,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else."
208388,L328884,u6150,m409,PAUL,We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
208389,L328883,u6145,m409,AMANDA,...once-in-a-lifetime.
208390,L328880,u6145,m409,AMANDA,We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
208391,L328879,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile..."
208392,L328877,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring."
208393,L328876,u6150,m409,PAUL,"First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years."
208394,L329153,u6146,m409,BILLY,Where is it?
208395,L329152,u6145,m409,AMANDA,You had the phone the whole time?
208396,L329148,u6145,m409,AMANDA,What about Eric?
208397,L329147,u6146,m409,BILLY,"Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed."
208398,L329146,u6145,m409,AMANDA,What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
208399,L329145,u6146,m409,BILLY,We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
208400,L329094,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"He's not a kill, he's still alive."
208401,L329093,u6146,m409,BILLY,He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
208402,L329067,u6146,m409,BILLY,Here!
208403,L329066,u6145,m409,AMANDA,I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
208404,L328967,u6146,m409,BILLY,Who's that?
208405,L328966,u6145,m409,AMANDA,He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
208406,L328889,u6146,m409,BILLY,How low?
208407,L328888,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low."
208408,L329263,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?"
208409,L329262,u6148,m409,ERIC,He loves you too.
208410,L329261,u6145,m409,AMANDA,"Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much."
208411,L329260,u6148,m409,ERIC,then we should...
208412,L329259,u6145,m409,AMANDA,I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
208413,L329258,u6148,m409,ERIC,We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
208414,L329256,u6145,m409,AMANDA,Just hold on.
208415,L329255,u6148,m409,ERIC,Where's Dad?
208416,L329253,u6148,m409,ERIC,DAD!
208417,L329252,u6145,m409,AMANDA,PAUL!
208418,L329194,u6146,m409,BILLY,It won't hold!
208419,L329193,u6150,m409,PAUL,Eric!
208420,L329150,u6146,m409,BILLY,Sure.
208421,L329149,u6150,m409,PAUL,He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
208422,L329127,u6146,m409,BILLY,Dr. Grant was.
208423,L329126,u6150,m409,PAUL,I thought you were an expert.
208424,L329125,u6146,m409,BILLY,I dont know.
208425,L329096,u6146,m409,BILLY,They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
208426,L329095,u6150,m409,PAUL,"They couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down."
208427,L329007,u6146,m409,BILLY,"About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were."
208428,L329006,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top."
208429,L329005,u6146,m409,BILLY,"So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?"
208430,L328978,u6150,m409,PAUL,"I didn't know, there were two islands."
208431,L328977,u6146,m409,BILLY,That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
208432,L329202,u6146,m409,BILLY,I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
208433,L329201,u6149,m409,GRANT,NO!
208434,L329200,u6146,m409,BILLY,I CAN GET HIM!
208435,L329172,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place."
208436,L329171,u6146,m409,BILLY,You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
208437,L329168,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Billy, I can't talk to you now."
208438,L329167,u6146,m409,BILLY,"Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the..."
208439,L329166,u6149,m409,GRANT,We need to keep moving.
208440,L329088,u6149,m409,GRANT,KEEP GOING!
208441,L329087,u6146,m409,BILLY,ALAN!
208442,L329071,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish."
208443,L329070,u6146,m409,BILLY,We could co-write a paper.
208444,L329037,u6149,m409,GRANT,We should take it with us to signal any planes.
208445,L329036,u6146,m409,BILLY,It looks intact.
208446,L329004,u6149,m409,GRANT,That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
208447,L329003,u6146,m409,BILLY,I don't remember that on InGen's list.
208448,L329002,u6149,m409,GRANT,Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
208449,L329001,u6146,m409,BILLY,Baryonyx?
208450,L329000,u6149,m409,GRANT,They never got that big.
208451,L328999,u6146,m409,BILLY,Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
208452,L328998,u6149,m409,GRANT,How would you classify it?
208453,L328938,u6149,m409,GRANT,I don't think so.
208454,L328937,u6146,m409,BILLY,Is it a rex?
208455,L328914,u6149,m409,GRANT,Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
208456,L328913,u6146,m409,BILLY,I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
208457,L328902,u6149,m409,GRANT,"The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people."
208458,L328901,u6146,m409,BILLY,"Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along."
208459,L328900,u6149,m409,GRANT,Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
208460,L328899,u6146,m409,BILLY,It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
208461,L328898,u6149,m409,GRANT,That does sound lucky.
208462,L328897,u6146,m409,BILLY,No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
208463,L328896,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag."
208464,L328867,u6149,m409,GRANT,What?
208465,L328866,u6146,m409,BILLY,They're here.
208466,L328865,u6149,m409,GRANT,Absolutely not.
208467,L328863,u6149,m409,GRANT,Not if it can't dig.
208468,L328862,u6146,m409,BILLY,"It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology."
208469,L328861,u6149,m409,GRANT,You rented an automated litter box.
208470,L328860,u6146,m409,BILLY,Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
208471,L328859,u6149,m409,GRANT,We'll be broke in four weeks.
208472,L328858,u6146,m409,BILLY,How was your trip? Profitable?
208473,L328837,u6147,m409,ELLIE,Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
208474,L328836,u6149,m409,GRANT,A well-accepted theory.
208475,L328835,u6147,m409,ELLIE,"When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved."
208476,L328834,u6147,m409,ELLIE,"Goodbye, Alan."
208477,L328833,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Okay. Goodbye, Ellie."
208478,L328832,u6147,m409,ELLIE,"Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime."
208479,L328831,u6149,m409,GRANT,I'd better get going.
208480,L328830,u6149,m409,GRANT,The last of my breed.
208481,L328829,u6147,m409,ELLIE,Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
208482,L328828,u6149,m409,GRANT,"It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur."
208483,L328827,u6147,m409,ELLIE,Good luck with the fund raising.
208484,L328824,u6149,m409,GRANT,To a degree we never imagined.
208485,L328823,u6147,m409,ELLIE,You think they could talk to each other?
208486,L328822,u6149,m409,GRANT,"We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team."
208487,L328821,u6147,m409,ELLIE,I try not to.
208488,L328820,u6149,m409,GRANT,You remember the sounds they made?
208489,L328819,u6147,m409,ELLIE,My favorite.
208490,L328818,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Raptors, mostly."
208491,L328817,u6147,m409,ELLIE,Anything good?
208492,L328813,u6149,m409,GRANT,Really?  What do you do there?
208493,L328812,u6147,m409,ELLIE,"So, Mark's working at the State Department now."
208494,L328809,u6147,m409,ELLIE,"Sorry, Alan it's been six years."
208495,L328808,u6149,m409,GRANT,He used to know me.
208496,L328799,u6147,m409,ELLIE,He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
208497,L328798,u6149,m409,GRANT,Hmm?
208498,L329291,u6149,m409,GRANT,The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
208499,L329290,u6148,m409,ERIC,What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
208500,L329285,u6149,m409,GRANT,No we're not.
208501,L329284,u6148,m409,ERIC,We're safe!
208502,L329280,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried."
208503,L329279,u6148,m409,ERIC,No. I couldn't see.
208504,L329278,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?"
208505,L329277,u6149,m409,GRANT,You're right.
208506,L329276,u6148,m409,ERIC,You should.
208507,L329275,u6149,m409,GRANT,It's strikes me now I never told her that.
208508,L329274,u6149,m409,GRANT,She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
208509,L329273,u6148,m409,ERIC,"The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?"
208510,L329236,u6148,m409,ERIC,Something must've scared them.
208511,L329235,u6149,m409,GRANT,Bonitas.
208512,L329223,u6149,m409,GRANT,Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
208513,L329222,u6148,m409,ERIC,But then you never get to go in space.
208514,L329221,u6149,m409,GRANT,"See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground."
208515,L329220,u6148,m409,ERIC,I want to be an astronaut.
208516,L329219,u6149,m409,GRANT,I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
208517,L329218,u6149,m409,GRANT,No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
208518,L329217,u6148,m409,ERIC,Do you have any kids?
208519,L329174,u6148,m409,ERIC,Then we go home?
208520,L329173,u6149,m409,GRANT,"We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up."
208521,L329144,u6148,m409,ERIC,"Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get."
208522,L329143,u6149,m409,GRANT,Why?
208523,L329142,u6148,m409,ERIC,Are you sure?
208524,L329141,u6149,m409,GRANT,We need to head for the coast.
208525,L329140,u6148,m409,ERIC,"I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start."
208526,L329139,u6149,m409,GRANT,How much of this island have you explored?
208527,L329138,u6148,m409,ERIC,Mine's new.
208528,L329137,u6149,m409,GRANT,A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
208529,L329136,u6148,m409,ERIC,Know what this is?
208530,L329121,u6148,m409,ERIC,"I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself."
208531,L329120,u6149,m409,GRANT,What did you think?
208532,L329119,u6148,m409,ERIC,Yeah.
208533,L329118,u6149,m409,GRANT,Did you read Malcolm's book?
208534,L329117,u6149,m409,GRANT,The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
208535,L329116,u6148,m409,ERIC,Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
208536,L329115,u6149,m409,GRANT,"It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks."
208537,L329114,u6148,m409,ERIC,"Found this, but the battery's dead."
208538,L329113,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Any weapons, radios?"
208539,L329112,u6148,m409,ERIC,"When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind."
208540,L329111,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me."
208541,L329110,u6148,m409,ERIC,The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
208542,L329109,u6149,m409,GRANT,Which one do you prefer?
208543,L329108,u6148,m409,ERIC,"You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books."
208544,L329107,u6149,m409,GRANT,You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
208545,L329106,u6148,m409,ERIC,"They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out."
208546,L329105,u6149,m409,GRANT,On the island.
208547,L329104,u6148,m409,ERIC,In Costa Rica?
208548,L329103,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Eric, your parents are both here."
208549,L329232,u6150,m409,PAUL,Stan.
208550,L329231,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help."
208551,L329230,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing."
208552,L329210,u6150,m409,PAUL,"It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use."
208553,L329209,u6149,m409,GRANT,Billy!
208554,L329082,u6149,m409,GRANT,Back out! Move!
208555,L329081,u6150,m409,PAUL,Amanda!
208556,L329064,u6149,m409,GRANT,But you never came across just one.
208557,L329063,u6150,m409,PAUL,Well that's good.
208558,L329009,u6150,m409,PAUL,"There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The ""plus"" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that."
208559,L329008,u6149,m409,GRANT,"There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?"
208560,L328986,u6149,m409,GRANT,"You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive."
208561,L328985,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son."
208562,L328984,u6149,m409,GRANT,"No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island."
208563,L328976,u6150,m409,PAUL,Sure you have. You wrote that book...
208564,L328975,u6149,m409,GRANT,I have never been on this island!
208565,L328974,u6150,m409,PAUL,We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
208566,L328929,u6149,m409,GRANT,"Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane..."
208567,L328928,u6150,m409,PAUL,Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
208568,L328927,u6149,m409,GRANT,What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
208569,L328921,u6149,m409,GRANT,This plane can not land!
208570,L328920,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy."
208571,L328893,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government."
208572,L328892,u6149,m409,GRANT,That's hard to believe.
208573,L328887,u6149,m409,GRANT,"I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest."
208574,L328886,u6150,m409,PAUL,"No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you."
208575,L328885,u6149,m409,GRANT,"That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified..."
208576,L328882,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something..."
208577,L328881,u6149,m409,GRANT,Hmmm.
208578,L328874,u6150,m409,PAUL,I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
208579,L328873,u6149,m409,GRANT,"You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time."
208580,L328872,u6150,m409,PAUL,"Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat."
208581,L328871,u6149,m409,GRANT,"What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?"
208582,L330610,u6151,m410,AJAY,No.  I feel something.
208583,L330609,u6159,m410,ROLAND,You hear something?
208584,L330401,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --"
208585,L330400,u6151,m410,AJAY,Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
208586,L330376,u6159,m410,ROLAND,It certainly does.
208587,L330375,u6151,m410,AJAY,It matches the pictures.
208588,L330232,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me."
208589,L330231,u6151,m410,AJAY,"You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?"
208590,L330230,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Sorry.  We were saying?
208591,L330222,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--"
208592,L330221,u6151,m410,AJAY,How do you mean?
208593,L330220,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"Just a little bit too much, I think."
208594,L330219,u6151,m410,AJAY,"But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I."
208595,L330218,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go."
208596,L330217,u6151,m410,AJAY,"I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded."
208597,L330216,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?"
208598,L330215,u6151,m410,AJAY,"You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?"
208599,L330214,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?"
208600,L330213,u6151,m410,AJAY,How did you know?
208601,L330383,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
208602,L330382,u6152,m410,EDDIE,"Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!"
208603,L330302,u6152,m410,EDDIE,Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
208604,L330301,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Is there an antidote?
208605,L330254,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
208606,L330253,u6152,m410,EDDIE,It doesn't matter what I think.
208607,L330252,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"You think I'm all talk, Eddie?"
208608,L330251,u6152,m410,EDDIE,Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
208609,L330250,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,You are an academic.
208610,L330249,u6152,m410,EDDIE,"Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics."
208611,L330248,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"""Minimal"" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --"
208612,L330247,u6152,m410,EDDIE,Minimal.
208613,L330246,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Any damage?
208614,L330197,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,"Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --"
208615,L330196,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"I'm not going, John."
208616,L330194,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,"You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously."
208617,L330193,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,John . . .
208618,L330192,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,"I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost."
208619,L330191,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,So what?
208620,L330190,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
208621,L330189,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?"
208622,L330188,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,"After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them."
208623,L330187,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"No, no, no, no, no, no . . ."
208624,L330186,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,"Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar."
208625,L330185,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,I don't believe you.
208626,L330184,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,"The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you."
208627,L330183,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,What are you talking about?
208628,L330182,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
208629,L330181,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,What?
208630,L330180,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,"You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B."
208631,L330179,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
208632,L330178,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
208633,L330177,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,I didn't know you -- weren't well.
208634,L330176,u6153,m410,HAMMOND,"When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned."
208635,L330175,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Resentful.
208636,L330533,u6154,m410,JUTTSON,"Everyone, keep your voices down!"
208637,L330532,u6158,m410,NICK,Are you looking for a problem?
208638,L330395,u6158,m410,NICK,You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
208639,L330394,u6154,m410,JUTTSON,But he's the head of InGen!
208640,L330390,u6158,m410,NICK,Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
208641,L330389,u6154,m410,JUTTSON,"InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?"
208642,L330337,u6158,m410,NICK,"-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market."
208643,L330336,u6154,m410,JUTTSON,Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
208644,L330304,u6154,m410,JUTTSON,-- my --
208645,L330303,u6158,m410,NICK,Oh --
208646,L330324,u6160,m410,SARAH,We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
208647,L330323,u6154,m410,JUTTSON,"That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were."
208648,L330322,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --"
208649,L330321,u6154,m410,JUTTSON,"I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did."
208650,L330320,u6160,m410,SARAH,"And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible."
208651,L330316,u6154,m410,JUTTSON,Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
208652,L330315,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!"
208653,L330312,u6160,m410,SARAH,Not without a shot of the nest.
208654,L330311,u6154,m410,JUTTSON,"The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!"
208655,L330309,u6154,m410,JUTTSON,I want to see the nesting ground!
208656,L330308,u6160,m410,SARAH,"That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!"
208657,L330710,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Come on!
208658,L330709,u6155,m410,KELLY,Dad!
208659,L330526,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,I'm fine... I'm fine...
208660,L330525,u6155,m410,KELLY,"I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!"
208661,L330524,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
208662,L330425,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
208663,L330424,u6155,m410,KELLY,What are you guys gonna do?
208664,L330388,u6155,m410,KELLY,On the side of that one truck.
208665,L330387,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Where does it say that?
208666,L330386,u6155,m410,KELLY,"""InGen.""  What's InGen?"
208667,L330349,u6155,m410,KELLY,"Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did."
208668,L330348,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,How could you possibly?
208669,L330279,u6155,m410,KELLY,"You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?"
208670,L330278,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
208671,L330277,u6155,m410,KELLY,"I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin."
208672,L330276,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
208673,L330275,u6155,m410,KELLY,I could come with you.
208674,L330274,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,That Richard.
208675,L330273,u6155,m410,KELLY,No.  Richard talked to his parents.
208676,L330272,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"Well, is he?"
208677,L330271,u6155,m410,KELLY,That was about a year ago.
208678,L330270,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?"
208679,L330269,u6155,m410,KELLY,Which one?
208680,L330268,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Is that kid still bothering you?
208681,L330267,u6155,m410,KELLY,"No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while."
208682,L330266,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
208683,L330265,u6155,m410,KELLY,"I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient."
208684,L330264,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
208685,L330263,u6155,m410,KELLY,My vacation is over in a week.
208686,L330262,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
208687,L330261,u6155,m410,KELLY,Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
208688,L330260,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time."
208689,L330259,u6155,m410,KELLY,I don't even know this woman.
208690,L330258,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there."
208691,L330256,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Kelly!  What are you doing here?
208692,L330255,u6155,m410,KELLY,"Hi, Dad."
208693,L330677,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"Let it go, Peter.  The animal won."
208694,L330676,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"If I don't move, I can't shoot it."
208695,L330675,u6159,m410,ROLAND,It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
208696,L330674,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,It's... behind... us.
208697,L330672,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Why?
208698,L330671,u6159,m410,ROLAND,We took to the rock.
208699,L330662,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Possible.
208700,L330661,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
208701,L330650,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Good.
208702,L330649,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem."
208703,L330644,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Operations building.  Far end of the street.
208704,L330643,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Where's the power and radio setup?
208705,L330637,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Piss.
208706,L330636,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,What is that?
208707,L330550,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,The velociraptors.
208708,L330549,u6159,m410,ROLAND,What is?
208709,L330450,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Isn't it obvious?
208710,L330449,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,What in Christ's name is going on?!
208711,L330443,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
208712,L330442,u6159,m410,ROLAND,You've broken its leg!
208713,L330441,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
208714,L330439,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-"
208715,L330438,u6159,m410,ROLAND,What?
208716,L330437,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --"
208717,L330436,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
208718,L330435,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
208719,L330434,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill."
208720,L330433,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,You rally think this'll draw the parent?
208721,L330431,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
208722,L330430,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down."
208723,L330429,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,How close do you have to be?
208724,L330428,u6159,m410,ROLAND,My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
208725,L330427,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,What kind of gun is that?
208726,L330379,u6159,m410,ROLAND,To collect my fee.
208727,L330378,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Where do you think you're going?!
208728,L330364,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Good lad.
208729,L330363,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Okay.
208730,L330362,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?"
208731,L330361,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks."
208732,L330360,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
208733,L330359,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,What?  Why?
208734,L330358,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"Cancel that, Dieter."
208735,L330652,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Piss.
208736,L330651,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,What's he got in there?
208737,L330210,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it."
208738,L330209,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
208739,L330208,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
208740,L330207,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life."
208741,L330206,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,You version of it.
208742,L330205,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"I didn't tell anything, I told the truth."
208743,L330204,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--"
208744,L330203,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
208745,L330202,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
208746,L330201,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there."
208747,L330200,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?"
208748,L330665,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11."
208749,L330664,u6160,m410,SARAH,You're going too?
208750,L330663,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"You know how to work a radio, don't you?"
208751,L330654,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
208752,L330653,u6160,m410,SARAH,What?
208753,L330537,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Oh, God."
208754,L330536,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,Their what?
208755,L330529,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!"
208756,L330528,u6156,m410,LUDLOW,"Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?"
208757,L330706,u6158,m410,NICK,Look!  Sarah!
208758,L330705,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Something's wrong.

208771,L330648,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,I don't know.

208779,L330458,u6158,m410,NICK,No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
208780,L330457,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!

208782,L330455,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,?!
208783,L330423,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so."

208785,L330420,u6158,m410,NICK,"I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.

208786,L330419,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Our chance to do what?
208787,L330418,u6158,m410,NICK,Then this is our chance.
208788,L330345,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous."

In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.

208801,L330575,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,But why?

We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help."
208818,L330554,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
208819,L330686,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Birdshit?
208820,L330685,u6160,m410,SARAH,These formations.  They're dried --
208821,L330684,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,What?
208822,L330683,u6160,m410,SARAH,Ian.  It's guano.
208823,L330590,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square."
208824,L330589,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Maybe.  Maybe not.
208825,L330588,u6160,m410,SARAH,"You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy."
208826,L330510,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,They're pushing us over the cliff.
208827,L330509,u6160,m410,SARAH,What?!
208828,L330508,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"Oh, God."
208829,L330504,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
208830,L330503,u6160,m410,SARAH,"They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back."
208831,L330502,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
208832,L330492,u6160,m410,SARAH,"I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --"
208833,L330491,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Are you insane?!
208834,L330490,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --"
208835,L330487,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!"
208836,L330486,u6160,m410,SARAH,"That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!"
208837,L330470,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"Think fast, Sarah."
208838,L330469,u6160,m410,SARAH,"It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows..."
208839,L330468,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,Can you set up?
208840,L330393,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,John Hammond.
208841,L330392,u6160,m410,SARAH,Funded by whom?
208842,L330391,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
208843,L330342,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,I'm her father.
208844,L330341,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal."
208845,L330340,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
208846,L330335,u6160,m410,SARAH,"What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?"
208847,L330334,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!"
208848,L330318,u6157,m410,MALCOLM,"That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change."
208849,L330317,u6160,m410,SARAH,"No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact."
208850,L330712,u6160,m410,SARAH,Where's Ian?
208851,L330711,u6158,m410,NICK,Where's Kelly?
208852,L330621,u6158,m410,NICK,JUMP!
208853,L330620,u6160,m410,SARAH,WHAT ARE YOU-
208854,L330499,u6160,m410,SARAH,No.
208855,L330498,u6158,m410,NICK,"There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One ""no"" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:"
208856,L330479,u6158,m410,NICK,I'm trying!
208857,L330478,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Hold it down, Nick!"
208858,L330474,u6160,m410,SARAH,"We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --"
208859,L330473,u6158,m410,NICK,Give it more morphine!
208860,L330467,u6160,m410,SARAH,"That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old."
208861,L330466,u6158,m410,NICK,That little black line?
208862,L330385,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army."
208863,L330384,u6158,m410,NICK,"Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!"
208864,L330351,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-"
208865,L330350,u6158,m410,NICK,The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
208866,L330328,u6158,m410,NICK,"Oh, no!"
208867,L330327,u6160,m410,SARAH,-- way we could safely --
208868,L330293,u6160,m410,SARAH,I believe in him.
208869,L330292,u6158,m410,NICK,"He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink."
208870,L330291,u6160,m410,SARAH,Ian's a very good friend of mine.
208871,L330290,u6158,m410,NICK,"Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?"
208872,L330289,u6160,m410,SARAH,You think this is all a joke?
208873,L330288,u6158,m410,NICK,"Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths."
208874,L330287,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?"
208875,L330286,u6158,m410,NICK,Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
208876,L330285,u6160,m410,SARAH,That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
208877,L330284,u6158,m410,NICK,"I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace."
208878,L330283,u6160,m410,SARAH,"So what's your story, Nick?"
208879,L330660,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
208880,L330659,u6160,m410,SARAH,You've got to be kidding.
208881,L330633,u6159,m410,ROLAND,Can the kid walk?
208882,L330632,u6160,m410,SARAH,Ask her.
208883,L330600,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!"
208884,L330599,u6160,m410,SARAH,We have to send someone to look for him!
208885,L330543,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --"
208886,L330542,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight."
208887,L330541,u6159,m410,ROLAND,"None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --"
208888,L330540,u6160,m410,SARAH,"Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take."
208889,L332224,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all."
208890,L332223,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?"
208891,L332222,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not."
208892,L332221,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -"
208893,L332003,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,Where did the vehicles stop?
208894,L332002,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,Phones are out too.
208895,L331990,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,The monitors are failing.
208896,L331989,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
208897,L331988,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!"
208898,L331987,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,What now?
208899,L331986,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?"
208900,L331975,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?"
208901,L331974,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,The door security systems are shutting down.
208902,L331973,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,What?
208903,L331964,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse."
208904,L331963,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
208905,L331962,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
208906,L331957,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain."
208907,L331956,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
208908,L331917,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,Damn!
208909,L331916,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now."
208910,L331912,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"It's not worth taking the chance, John."
208911,L331911,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,You're sure we have to?
208912,L331910,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off."
208913,L331879,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,Stop the program!  Stop the program!
208914,L331878,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -
208915,L332242,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,'Bout thirty seconds.
208916,L332241,u6163,m411,ELLIE,How long will this take?
208917,L332232,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
208918,L332231,u6163,m411,ELLIE,How would we cut off the lysine?
208919,L332230,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die."
208920,L332226,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -"
208921,L332225,u6163,m411,ELLIE,But would we get the phones back?
208922,L332220,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
208923,L332219,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -"
208924,L332077,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time."
208925,L332076,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,Uh - - about two million.
208926,L332075,u6163,m411,ELLIE,How many lines of code are there?
208927,L332074,u6163,m411,ELLIE,What one?
208928,L332073,u6161,m411,ARNOLD,"I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -"
208929,L332072,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?"
208930,L331626,u6171,m411,NEDRY,"I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research."
208931,L331625,u6162,m411,DODGSON,"I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?"
208932,L331624,u6171,m411,NEDRY,"That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right."
208933,L331623,u6162,m411,DODGSON,"Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then."
208934,L331622,u6171,m411,NEDRY,What?  No menthol?
208935,L331620,u6171,m411,NEDRY,How am I supposed to transport them?
208936,L331619,u6162,m411,DODGSON,Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
208937,L331618,u6171,m411,NEDRY,"Oh, I'll get 'em all."
208938,L331616,u6171,m411,NEDRY,"Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?"
208939,L331615,u6162,m411,DODGSON,You shouldn't use my name.
208940,L331950,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?"
208941,L331949,u6164,m411,GENNARO,"Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving."
208942,L331887,u6164,m411,GENNARO,Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
208943,L331886,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Yours was fully illustrated, honey."
208944,L331883,u6164,m411,GENNARO,Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
208945,L331882,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
208946,L331781,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary."
208947,L331780,u6164,m411,GENNARO,Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
208948,L331676,u6164,m411,GENNARO,Shhhhh!
208949,L331675,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
208950,L331952,u6163,m411,ELLIE,I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
208951,L331951,u6167,m411,HARDING,Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
208952,L331907,u6167,m411,HARDING,You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
208953,L331906,u6163,m411,ELLIE,There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
208954,L331905,u6167,m411,HARDING,Pretty sure.
208955,L331904,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Are you sure?
208956,L331903,u6167,m411,HARDING,"Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them."
208957,L331902,u6163,m411,ELLIE,That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
208958,L331901,u6167,m411,HARDING,They are?  I'll be damned.
208959,L331900,u6163,m411,ELLIE,These are dilated.  Take a look.
208960,L331899,u6167,m411,HARDING,"Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted."
208961,L331898,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Six weeks?
208962,L331897,u6167,m411,HARDING,"Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so."
208963,L332312,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?"
208964,L332311,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box."
208965,L332310,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.
208966,L332286,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Look.
208967,L332285,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -"
208968,L332284,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Why?
208969,L332283,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"But you know, I should  really be the one going ."
208970,L332274,u6163,m411,ELLIE,John....
208971,L332273,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing."
208972,L332192,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?"

208974,L332190,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion."
208975,L332189,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around."
208976,L332188,u6163,m411,ELLIE,But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
208977,L332187,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit."
208978,L332186,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  ""I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?"" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade..."
208979,L332185,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Carousel.
208980,L332184,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
208981,L332183,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
208982,L331747,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.

208990,L331598,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
208991,L331597,u6163,m411,ELLIE,I have samples all over the kitchen.
208992,L331596,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?"
208993,L331595,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Did I say jerk?
208994,L332361,u6163,m411,ELLIE,I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
208995,L332360,u6165,m411,GRANT,"Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!"
208996,L332359,u6163,m411,ELLIE,You can't hold it by yourself!
208997,L332358,u6165,m411,GRANT,Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
208998,L332351,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors."
208999,L332350,u6165,m411,GRANT,"It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?"
209000,L331954,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish."
209001,L331953,u6165,m411,GRANT,Are you sure?
209002,L331948,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim."

209023,L331690,u6165,m411,GRANT,Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
209024,L331670,u6165,m411,GRANT,We're out of a job.
209025,L331669,u6163,m411,ELLIE,So what are you thinking?
209026,L331665,u6165,m411,GRANT,How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
209027,L331664,u6163,m411,ELLIE,We were right!
209028,L331663,u6165,m411,GRANT,"Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!"
209029,L331659,u6165,m411,GRANT,Say again?
209030,L331658,u6163,m411,ELLIE,You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
209031,L331653,u6163,m411,ELLIE,They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
209032,L331652,u6165,m411,GRANT,"Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong."

209034,L331650,u6165,m411,GRANT,The movement!
209035,L331607,u6165,m411,GRANT,What kind of park is it?
209036,L331606,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Why would they care what we think?

209038,L331599,u6165,m411,GRANT,And what are those?

209040,L331593,u6165,m411,GRANT,"Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie....."
209041,L331592,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Okay, who's the jerk?"
209042,L331582,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!"
209043,L331581,u6165,m411,GRANT,"Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!"
209044,L331580,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Anything else, you old fossil?"
209045,L331579,u6165,m411,GRANT,The Cretaceous.
209046,L331578,u6163,m411,ELLIE,The what?
209047,L331577,u6165,m411,GRANT,They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
209048,L331576,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell."
209049,L331575,u6165,m411,GRANT,They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
209050,L331574,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell."
209051,L331573,u6165,m411,GRANT,They smell.
209052,L331572,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Cheap, cheap, cheap."
209053,L331571,u6165,m411,GRANT,"Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive."
209054,L331570,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?"
209055,L331569,u6165,m411,GRANT,"Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?"
209056,L331568,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him."
209057,L331560,u6165,m411,GRANT,"Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -"
209058,L331559,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
209059,L331543,u6165,m411,GRANT,That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
209060,L331542,u6163,m411,ELLIE,A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
209061,L331541,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order."
209062,L331540,u6165,m411,GRANT,The taphonomy sure looks that way.
209063,L331539,u6163,m411,ELLIE,They died together?
209064,L331538,u6165,m411,GRANT,Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
209065,L332305,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Like hell it is!
209066,L332304,u6170,m411,MULDOON,It's all right.
209067,L332303,u6170,m411,MULDOON,Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
209068,L332302,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Why not?
209069,L332301,u6170,m411,MULDOON,No. We can't.
209070,L332300,u6163,m411,ELLIE,I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
209071,L332299,u6170,m411,MULDOON,"C'mon on, this way."
209072,L332298,u6170,m411,MULDOON,The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
209073,L332297,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Oh my God.  Aw, God."
209074,L332296,u6170,m411,MULDOON,Stick to my heels.
209075,L332295,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Okay, I'm on channel two."
209076,L332288,u6163,m411,ELLIE,We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
209077,L332287,u6170,m411,MULDOON,"Come on, let's go."
209078,L332280,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Okay.
209079,L332279,u6170,m411,MULDOON,I'm going with you.
209080,L332277,u6170,m411,MULDOON,"You can't just stroll down the road, you know."
209081,L332276,u6163,m411,ELLIE,I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
209082,L332228,u6163,m411,ELLIE,What's that?
209083,L332227,u6170,m411,MULDOON,What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
209084,L332136,u6170,m411,MULDOON,They're not here.
209085,L332135,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Alan?!
209086,L332134,u6170,m411,MULDOON,I don't know.
209087,L332133,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Do you see anything?
209088,L332132,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Alan!
209089,L332131,u6170,m411,MULDOON,Dr. Grant!
209090,L332130,u6163,m411,ELLIE,The other car!
209091,L332129,u6170,m411,MULDOON,"Ellie, com one!!"
209092,L332128,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"No, no, no!"
209093,L332127,u6170,m411,MULDOON,"Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens."
209094,L331758,u6170,m411,MULDOON,That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
209095,L331757,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"The fences are electrified, right?"
209096,L331756,u6170,m411,MULDOON,"They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came."
209097,L332248,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way."
209098,L332247,u6163,m411,ELLIE,- - shut up.
209099,L332246,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,Yes?
209100,L332238,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan.
209101,L332237,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever."
209102,L332148,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!"
209103,L332147,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!"
209104,L332146,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!"
209105,L332145,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Faster, faster!"
209106,L332124,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,Please - - chance it.
209107,L332123,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Can we chance moving him?
209108,L331909,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Yeah.
209109,L331908,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,Dino droppings?
209110,L331874,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Alan?
209111,L331873,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
209112,L331872,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Alan?
209113,L331871,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now."
209114,L331870,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Unpredictability....
209115,L331869,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?"
209116,L331868,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Oh, imperfections?"
209117,L331867,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -"
209118,L331866,u6163,m411,ELLIE,"Alan, listen to this."
209119,L331865,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -"
209120,L331864,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
209121,L331862,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
209122,L331861,u6163,m411,ELLIE,I'm still not clear on Chaos.
209123,L331860,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
209124,L331851,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
209125,L331850,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
209126,L331735,u6163,m411,ELLIE,Anti-nature.
209127,L331734,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,It's anti-nature.
209128,L331733,u6163,m411,ELLIE,When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
209129,L331732,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,And scary.
209130,L331731,u6163,m411,ELLIE,And scary.
209131,L331730,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"I know, it's very exciting."
209132,L331729,u6163,m411,ELLIE,I get ah - -
209133,L331728,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,That's right.  Will break through.
209134,L331639,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!"
209135,L331638,u6163,m411,ELLIE,No.
209136,L331536,u6172,m411,ROSTAGNO,Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
209137,L331535,u6164,m411,GENNARO,Why not?
209138,L331534,u6172,m411,ROSTAGNO,Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
209139,L331533,u6164,m411,GENNARO,"If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant."
209140,L331530,u6164,m411,GENNARO,"Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here."
209141,L331529,u6172,m411,ROSTAGNO,Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
209142,L331528,u6164,m411,GENNARO,I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
209143,L331527,u6172,m411,ROSTAGNO,He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
209144,L331526,u6164,m411,GENNARO,You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
209145,L331525,u6172,m411,ROSTAGNO,He sends his apologies.
209146,L331524,u6164,m411,GENNARO,What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?

209365,L331777,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.

209367,L331775,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!"
209368,L331774,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
209369,L331772,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun."

209371,L331723,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is."

209376,L331634,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!"
209377,L331633,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
209378,L331632,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!"
209379,L331631,u6169,m411,MALCOLM,"John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!"

209385,L331841,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,"I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not."
209386,L331840,u6171,m411,NEDRY,"You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem."
209387,L331839,u6166,m411,HAMMOND,I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
209388,L331838,u6171,m411,NEDRY,"I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?

209493,L332719,u6176,m412,HARDING,"Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?"
209494,L332566,u6176,m412,HARDING,You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
209495,L332565,u6180,m412,RUBY,What?
209496,L332564,u6176,m412,HARDING,And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
209497,L332563,u6180,m412,RUBY,Quite a circus.
209498,L332481,u6176,m412,HARDING,That's my job.
209499,L332480,u6180,m412,RUBY,I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
209500,L332479,u6176,m412,HARDING,I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
209501,L332478,u6180,m412,RUBY,Two.
209502,L332718,u6180,m412,RUBY,Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
209503,L332717,u6177,m412,HAYES,"Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?"
209504,L332716,u6180,m412,RUBY,And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
209505,L332715,u6180,m412,RUBY,Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
209506,L332714,u6177,m412,HAYES,Who's chest?
209507,L332713,u6180,m412,RUBY,That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
209508,L332506,u6180,m412,RUBY,"He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private."
209509,L332505,u6177,m412,HAYES,Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
209510,L332502,u6177,m412,HAYES,That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
209511,L332501,u6180,m412,RUBY,A house?
209512,L332500,u6177,m412,HAYES,Compared to this guy... amateur.
209513,L332499,u6180,m412,RUBY,I thought that was Ted Bundy.
209514,L332498,u6177,m412,HAYES,"Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history."
209515,L332497,u6180,m412,RUBY,What are the charges?
209516,L332496,u6177,m412,HAYES,Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
209517,L332495,u6180,m412,RUBY,Three.  Where's my client?
209518,L332539,u6179,m412,KWAN,A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
209519,L332538,u6180,m412,RUBY,"""Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."""
209520,L332537,u6179,m412,KWAN,"This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction..."
209521,L332536,u6180,m412,RUBY,You watch this garbage?
209522,L332533,u6180,m412,RUBY,"I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything."
209523,L332532,u6179,m412,KWAN,You think that's going to work?
209524,L332530,u6180,m412,RUBY,Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
209525,L332529,u6179,m412,KWAN,Because everyone knows he's guilty...
209526,L332528,u6180,m412,RUBY,So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
209527,L332526,u6179,m412,KWAN,Video store?
209528,L332525,u6180,m412,RUBY,Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
209529,L332522,u6180,m412,RUBY,It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
209530,L332521,u6179,m412,KWAN,Sorry.
209531,L332518,u6180,m412,RUBY,"I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed."
209532,L332517,u6179,m412,KWAN,Are you going to plead insanity?
209533,L332942,u6180,m412,RUBY,My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
209534,L332941,u6181,m412,SENA,What happened? Where's Jason?
209535,L332918,u6181,m412,SENA,For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
209536,L332917,u6180,m412,RUBY,Are you all right?
209537,L332911,u6180,m412,RUBY,"Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex."
209538,L332910,u6181,m412,SENA,We're down to seven minutes.
209539,L332886,u6181,m412,SENA,"If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack."
209540,L332885,u6180,m412,RUBY,Ten minutes...
209541,L332884,u6181,m412,SENA,About ten minutes.
209542,L332883,u6180,m412,RUBY,How long will the effect last?
209543,L332882,u6181,m412,SENA,Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
209544,L332881,u6180,m412,RUBY,So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
209545,L332880,u6181,m412,SENA,_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
209546,L332879,u6180,m412,RUBY,What's that?
209547,L332877,u6180,m412,RUBY,Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
209548,L332876,u6181,m412,SENA,And if he's not?
209549,L332875,u6180,m412,RUBY,"Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us."
209550,L332874,u6181,m412,SENA,Think it'll do any good?
209551,L332873,u6180,m412,RUBY,I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
209552,L332872,u6181,m412,SENA,You know how to use one of those?
209553,L332868,u6180,m412,RUBY,Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
209554,L332867,u6181,m412,SENA,Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
209555,L332866,u6180,m412,RUBY,I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
209556,L332865,u6181,m412,SENA,Where's he going?
209557,L332858,u6181,m412,SENA,Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
209558,L332857,u6180,m412,RUBY,"If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim."
209559,L332856,u6181,m412,SENA,Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
209560,L332855,u6180,m412,RUBY,So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
209561,L332842,u6181,m412,SENA,Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
209562,L332841,u6180,m412,RUBY,How's that possible?
209563,L332840,u6181,m412,SENA,This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
209564,L332836,u6181,m412,SENA,Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
209565,L332835,u6180,m412,RUBY,What are you doing?
209566,L332816,u6180,m412,RUBY,"A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there..."
209567,L332815,u6181,m412,SENA,You saw him?
209568,L332814,u6180,m412,RUBY,"It was Krueger, wasn't it?"
209569,L332813,u6181,m412,SENA,It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
209570,L332761,u6180,m412,RUBY,I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
209571,L332760,u6181,m412,SENA,You're not going to be there?
209572,L332759,u6180,m412,RUBY,I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
209573,L332758,u6181,m412,SENA,Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
209574,L332757,u6180,m412,RUBY,Great.	When can you do it?
209575,L332756,u6181,m412,SENA,Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
209576,L332755,u6180,m412,RUBY,Not yet.
209577,L332754,u6181,m412,SENA,I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
209578,L332753,u6180,m412,RUBY,So what do we do?
209579,L332752,u6181,m412,SENA,Add it to the list.
209580,L332751,u6180,m412,RUBY,That doesn't make sense.
209581,L332750,u6181,m412,SENA,It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
209582,L332748,u6181,m412,SENA,_It's a second REM pattern_.
209583,L332747,u6180,m412,RUBY,"Yeah, what is it?"
209584,L332746,u6181,m412,SENA,See this?
209585,L332740,u6181,m412,SENA,"Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too."
209586,L332739,u6180,m412,RUBY,Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
209587,L332738,u6181,m412,SENA,Uh-huh...
209588,L332737,u6180,m412,RUBY,"That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world."
209589,L332736,u6181,m412,SENA,I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
209590,L332735,u6180,m412,RUBY,"Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's."
209591,L332734,u6181,m412,SENA,Fascinating.
209592,L332733,u6180,m412,RUBY,He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
209593,L332732,u6181,m412,SENA,Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
209594,L332731,u6180,m412,RUBY,"Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?"
209595,L332730,u6181,m412,SENA,Me too. I'm drunk.
209596,L332729,u6180,m412,RUBY,"I think I'm onto something, Joe."
209597,L332687,u6180,m412,RUBY,"He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses."
209598,L332686,u6181,m412,SENA,There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
209599,L332685,u6181,m412,SENA,"I'll take my chances. Come on, I'm buying."
209600,L332684,u6180,m412,RUBY,That's open to debate.
209601,L332683,u6181,m412,SENA,Cute waitresses?
209602,L332682,u6180,m412,RUBY,There's a pizza place over on Market.
209603,L332681,u6181,m412,SENA,"Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?"
209604,L332675,u6181,m412,SENA,"We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal."
209605,L332674,u6180,m412,RUBY,How long will he need to be asleep?
209606,L332671,u6180,m412,RUBY,Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
209607,L332670,u6181,m412,SENA,"Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles."
209608,L332669,u6180,m412,RUBY,How do we prove it?
209609,L332668,u6181,m412,SENA,Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
209610,L332667,u6180,m412,RUBY,If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
209611,L332666,u6181,m412,SENA,Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
209612,L332665,u6180,m412,RUBY,So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
209613,L332664,u6181,m412,SENA,"It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well."
209614,L332663,u6180,m412,RUBY,Insomnolesence...
209615,L332662,u6181,m412,SENA,It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
209616,L332661,u6180,m412,RUBY,That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
209617,L332660,u6181,m412,SENA,"The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced..."
209618,L332659,u6181,m412,SENA,Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
209619,L332658,u6180,m412,RUBY,Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
209620,L332655,u6181,m412,SENA,You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
209621,L332654,u6180,m412,RUBY,Oh?
209622,L332653,u6181,m412,SENA,No. You've told me all I need to know.
209623,L332652,u6180,m412,RUBY,What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
209624,L332651,u6181,m412,SENA,That didn't sound very convincing.
209625,L332650,u6180,m412,RUBY,"I don't ""rationalize"" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all."
209626,L332649,u6181,m412,SENA,Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
209627,L332647,u6180,m412,RUBY,My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
209628,L332646,u6181,m412,SENA,"So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?"
209629,L332645,u6180,m412,RUBY,"Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead."
209630,L332644,u6181,m412,SENA,None of that's true?
209631,L332643,u6180,m412,RUBY,"That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake"
209632,L332642,u6181,m412,SENA,"I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated."
209633,L332641,u6180,m412,RUBY,So?
209634,L332640,u6181,m412,SENA,I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
209635,L332639,u6180,m412,RUBY,"Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium..."
209636,L332638,u6181,m412,SENA,No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
209637,L332637,u6180,m412,RUBY,This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
209638,L332636,u6181,m412,SENA,Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
209639,L332582,u6180,m412,RUBY,"This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete."
209640,L332581,u6181,m412,SENA,Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
209641,L332580,u6180,m412,RUBY,"This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane."
209642,L332579,u6181,m412,SENA,One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
209643,L332578,u6180,m412,RUBY,Oh?
209644,L332575,u6181,m412,SENA,I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
209645,L332574,u6180,m412,RUBY,He wets the bed?
209646,L332573,u6181,m412,SENA,Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
209647,L332572,u6180,m412,RUBY,Doesnit sleep?
209648,L332571,u6181,m412,SENA,"No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep."
209649,L332570,u6180,m412,RUBY,Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
209650,L332569,u6181,m412,SENA,He's fucking nuts.
209651,L332568,u6180,m412,RUBY,Well?
209652,L333033,u6182,m413,ANNA,"Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow."
209653,L333032,u6190,m413,KAFKA,A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
209654,L333031,u6182,m413,ANNA,What is it really?
209655,L333030,u6190,m413,KAFKA,It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
209656,L333028,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Up there.
209657,L333027,u6182,m413,ANNA,Where do you live?
209658,L333001,u6190,m413,KAFKA,You have been hearing the sordid side then.
209659,L333000,u6182,m413,ANNA,You work in the insurance department?
209660,L332992,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
209661,L332991,u6182,m413,ANNA,-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
209662,L333215,u6190,m413,KAFKA,What was the matter with it?
209663,L333214,u6183,m413,ASSISTANTS,Fine -- terrible.
209664,L333125,u6183,m413,ASSISTANTS,"No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes."
209665,L333124,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Have you worked here long?
209666,L333123,u6183,m413,ASSISTANTS,Yes -- we do.
209667,L333122,u6190,m413,KAFKA,You look like brothers.
209668,L333118,u6183,m413,ASSISTANTS,Yes -- that's us.
209669,L333117,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"My assistants, I presume."
209670,L333305,u6184,m413,BEARDED ANARCHIST,Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
209671,L333304,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
209672,L333302,u6184,m413,BEARDED ANARCHIST,-- Small.
209673,L333301,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,"-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?"
209674,L333201,u6184,m413,BEARDED ANARCHIST,The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
209675,L333200,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,-- Merely in the interests of order.
209676,L333183,u6184,m413,BEARDED ANARCHIST,You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
209677,L333182,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
209678,L333167,u6184,m413,BEARDED ANARCHIST,You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
209679,L333166,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
209680,L333440,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
209681,L333439,u6190,m413,KAFKA,A true friend would do it.
209682,L333438,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,Then its authority is in doubt.
209683,L333437,u6190,m413,KAFKA,It's my last and final one.
209684,L333436,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,What an extraordinary request!
209685,L333435,u6190,m413,KAFKA,If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
209686,L333434,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,Another one?
209687,L333433,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Will you do me a favor then?
209688,L333432,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,Yes.
209689,L333431,u6190,m413,KAFKA,-- You appreciate my writing.
209690,L333430,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
209691,L333429,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
209692,L333428,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
209693,L333427,u6190,m413,KAFKA,An empty tomb?
209694,L333426,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
209695,L333425,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,In a manner of speaking.
209696,L333424,u6190,m413,KAFKA,The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
209697,L333423,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
209698,L333422,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
209699,L333421,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
209700,L333420,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family."
209701,L333419,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --"
209702,L333418,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,"-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me."
209703,L333415,u6190,m413,KAFKA,The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
209704,L333414,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,A man must eat --  And drink.
209705,L333413,u6190,m413,KAFKA,You work in the cemetery.
209706,L333296,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"No -- not even success.  My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.  Not for other people, it's for me."
209707,L333295,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,Success or nothing?
209708,L333294,u6190,m413,KAFKA,That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
209709,L333293,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
209710,L333292,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy."
209711,L333291,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,"Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on."
209712,L333290,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
209713,L333289,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,"These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?"
209714,L333287,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,-- In what sense?
209715,L333286,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
209716,L333044,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
209717,L333043,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Did you?
209718,L333042,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,I read the one about the penal colony.
209719,L333041,u6190,m413,KAFKA,-- In magazines nobody reads.
209720,L333040,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,Just what you've published.
209721,L333039,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I don't know what you could have read.
209722,L333038,u6185,m413,BIZZLEBEK,I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
209723,L333233,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Yes.
209724,L333232,u6186,m413,BURGEL,Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
209725,L332959,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I'll commit that to memory.
209726,L332958,u6186,m413,BURGEL,"When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all."
209727,L332957,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Your credibility -- yes, it's well known."
209728,L332956,u6186,m413,BURGEL,But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
209729,L332955,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --"
209730,L332954,u6186,m413,BURGEL,"In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all."
209731,L332953,u6186,m413,BURGEL,"Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me."
209732,L332952,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?"
209733,L332951,u6186,m413,BURGEL,He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
209734,L332950,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
209735,L332949,u6186,m413,BURGEL,Did you see him?
209736,L332948,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"No, I left it in his office."
209737,L332947,u6186,m413,BURGEL,You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
209738,L332946,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I gave it to him yesterday.
209739,L332945,u6186,m413,BURGEL,The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
209740,L333116,u6186,m413,BURGEL,And you're late!
209741,L333115,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,You're detestable.
209742,L333114,u6186,m413,BURGEL,It's what I'm paid to do.
209743,L333113,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,You're just doing your job.
209744,L333112,u6186,m413,BURGEL,"It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying."
209745,L333111,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today."
209746,L333110,u6186,m413,BURGEL,"Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own."
209747,L333109,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
209748,L333108,u6186,m413,BURGEL,Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
209749,L333345,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir."
209750,L333344,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
209751,L333343,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
209752,L333342,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,"No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow."
209753,L333341,u6190,m413,KAFKA,No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
209754,L333340,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,Was there something else?
209755,L333338,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
209756,L333337,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,I do.
209757,L333336,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file."
209758,L333107,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
209759,L333106,u6190,m413,KAFKA,In a small way.
209760,L333105,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,I understand you fancy yourself an author.
209761,L333101,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,"-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it."
209762,L333100,u6190,m413,KAFKA,-- Eduard --
209763,L333099,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,"Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?"
209764,L333098,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Well, I --"
209765,L333097,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,"Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in."
209766,L333096,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"No, sir."
209767,L333095,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,"Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?"
209768,L333094,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I did not realize it was obligatory.
209769,L333093,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,"It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance."
209770,L333092,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I usually take lunch by the River.
209771,L333091,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
209772,L333090,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"To do my work well, I have little time for --"
209773,L333089,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,"You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees."
209774,L333088,u6190,m413,KAFKA,... My ... social situation?
209775,L333087,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,"You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving."
209776,L333086,u6187,m413,CHIEF CLERK,"Sit down, Kafka."
209777,L333085,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"You wanted to see me, sir."
209778,L333516,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard."
209779,L333515,u6190,m413,KAFKA,-- Listen to me --
209780,L333514,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
209781,L333513,u6190,m413,KAFKA,No -- not this time.
209782,L333512,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
209783,L333511,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way."
209784,L333510,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished."
209785,L333509,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
209786,L333508,u6190,m413,KAFKA,There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
209787,L333507,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
209788,L333506,u6190,m413,KAFKA,They're dead now.  We can get help.
209789,L333505,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
209790,L333504,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I -- I found your jailer.
209791,L333503,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
209792,L333501,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
209793,L333500,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Gabriela ...?
209794,L333499,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
209795,L333498,u6190,m413,KAFKA,-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
209796,L333497,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
209797,L333496,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Gabriela! -- you did get away.
209798,L333262,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
209799,L333261,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
209800,L333260,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all."
209801,L333259,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
209802,L333258,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Usually.
209803,L333257,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?"
209804,L333256,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I've heard of it happening.
209805,L333255,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
209806,L333254,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
209807,L333253,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it."
209808,L333252,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious."
209809,L333251,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
209810,L333250,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Burgel doesn't like anybody!
209811,L333249,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
209812,L333248,u6190,m413,KAFKA,That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
209813,L333247,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it."
209814,L333246,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
209815,L333245,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
209816,L333242,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,I wouldn't put it past him.
209817,L333241,u6190,m413,KAFKA,You don't believe that.
209818,L333240,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
209819,L333239,u6190,m413,KAFKA,It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
209820,L333238,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,They're not obliged to tell.
209821,L333237,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Why were you given notice?
209822,L333236,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
209823,L333235,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
209824,L333234,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity."
209825,L333209,u6190,m413,KAFKA,At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
209826,L333208,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"Yes -- which is why ""quiet, dependable people"" have to take charge of their own lives."
209827,L333207,u6190,m413,KAFKA,My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
209828,L333206,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
209829,L333197,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person."
209830,L333196,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression."
209831,L333195,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil."
209832,L333194,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
209833,L333190,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,He was murdered.
209834,L333189,u6190,m413,KAFKA,And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
209835,L333186,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
209836,L333185,u6190,m413,KAFKA,What of it?
209837,L333184,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?"
209838,L333177,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
209839,L333176,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
209840,L333175,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
209841,L333169,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
209842,L333168,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Ah -- we're back to the ""authorities"" you spoke of."
209843,L333161,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,You won't have any trouble finding it.
209844,L333160,u6190,m413,KAFKA,-- I don't know the Musil district.
209845,L333159,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
209846,L333158,u6190,m413,KAFKA,And you ...?
209847,L333157,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Eduard wanted to marry me.
209848,L333156,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
209849,L333155,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"You almost married recently, didn't you?"
209850,L333154,u6190,m413,KAFKA,... All right.
209851,L333153,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
209852,L333152,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Tonight?
209853,L333151,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Are you free tonight?
209854,L333150,u6190,m413,KAFKA,-- What could he have done to warrant that?
209855,L333149,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
209856,L333148,u6190,m413,KAFKA,When I have no reason to doubt.
209857,L333147,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
209858,L333146,u6190,m413,KAFKA,He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
209859,L333145,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
209860,L333144,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?"
209861,L333143,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
209862,L333142,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all."
209863,L333140,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him."
209864,L333139,u6190,m413,KAFKA,How long were you and Eduard --
209865,L333138,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
209866,L333137,u6190,m413,KAFKA,This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
209867,L333136,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,What's funny?
209868,L333135,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
209869,L333134,u6190,m413,KAFKA,That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
209870,L333133,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,What?
209871,L333132,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I suspected that he -- well.
209872,L333131,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
209873,L333130,u6190,m413,KAFKA,No.
209874,L333129,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
209875,L333023,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Yes.
209876,L333022,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
209877,L333021,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Have you looked?
209878,L333020,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I've never seen you here before.
209879,L333019,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Hello again.
209880,L332980,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,"Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30."
209881,L332979,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"I'm sorry, but I just wondered --"
209882,L332978,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,One of you must be mistaken.
209883,L332977,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --"
209884,L332976,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,Why would you suppose so?
209885,L332975,u6190,m413,KAFKA,You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
209886,L332974,u6188,m413,GABRIELA,I know.
209887,L332973,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
209888,L333280,u6190,m413,KAFKA,That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
209889,L333279,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,What did she say?
209890,L333278,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Maybe it's true then what she said.
209891,L333276,u6190,m413,KAFKA,She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
209892,L333275,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
209893,L333274,u6190,m413,KAFKA,You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
209894,L333272,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?"
209895,L333271,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
209896,L333270,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all."
209897,L333084,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
209898,L333083,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I'll bear that in mind.
209899,L333082,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,"Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party."
209900,L333081,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Probably not.
209901,L333079,u6190,m413,KAFKA,... Just a perception.
209902,L333078,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,What makes you think so?
209903,L333077,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"He wasn't a lonely man, though."
209904,L333076,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,We know that.
209905,L333075,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
209906,L333074,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
209907,L333073,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Can I ask -- how you found me?
209908,L333072,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,"He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think."
209909,L333071,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"No, I suppose not."
209910,L333070,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,"Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?"
209911,L333069,u6190,m413,KAFKA,No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
209912,L333068,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,Was he depressed?
209913,L333067,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I don't know.
209914,L333066,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
209915,L333065,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ..."
209916,L333064,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
209917,L333063,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Well -- other departments are, yes."
209918,L333062,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
209919,L333061,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Eight -- and seven months.
209920,L333060,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,Where you've been employed for seven years.
209921,L333059,u6190,m413,KAFKA,-- Accident and Compensation Association.
209922,L333058,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,Your office is the Workmen's --
209923,L333057,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house."
209924,L333056,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
209925,L333055,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Wednesday.  We left the office together.
209926,L333054,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
209927,L333053,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?"
209928,L333052,u6189,m413,INSPECTOR,Kafka -- is that your real name?
209929,L333407,u6194,m413,OSKAR,It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
209930,L333406,u6190,m413,KAFKA,My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
209931,L333405,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Close only by virtue of antithesis.
209932,L333404,u6194,m413,OSKAR,"Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings."
209933,L333401,u6190,m413,KAFKA,It's a farce.
209934,L333400,u6194,m413,OSKAR,-- Just doing our job.
209935,L333399,u6190,m413,KAFKA,For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
209936,L333380,u6190,m413,KAFKA,-- You should meet my father.
209937,L333379,u6194,m413,OSKAR,I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
209938,L333378,u6190,m413,KAFKA,What's the matter with you?
209939,L333373,u6190,m413,KAFKA,You mean you've actually begun some?
209940,L333372,u6194,m413,OSKAR,-- I was just trying to finish some work!
209941,L333224,u6194,m413,OSKAR,You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
209942,L333223,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
209943,L333220,u6194,m413,OSKAR,We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
209944,L333219,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Do you?
209945,L333320,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy.
209946,L333319,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!"
209947,L333318,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,"-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel."
209948,L333315,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Then why haven't I been --
209949,L333314,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
209950,L333311,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,"When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ..."
209951,L333310,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix."
209952,L333309,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,"-- Oh, yes, it's mad."
209953,L333308,u6190,m413,KAFKA,That's <u>mad</u>.
209954,L333174,u6195,m413,POCKMARKED ANARCHIST,"That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member."
209955,L333173,u6190,m413,KAFKA,... Why take me into your confidence?
209956,L333487,u6193,m413,MURNAU,As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
209957,L333486,u6190,m413,KAFKA,What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
209958,L333485,u6193,m413,MURNAU,"-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either."
209959,L333482,u6193,m413,MURNAU,"On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one."
209960,L333481,u6190,m413,KAFKA,The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
209961,L333478,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Lying in the gutter where they belong.
209962,L333477,u6193,m413,MURNAU,May I ask where your two warders are?
209963,L333475,u6193,m413,MURNAU,"Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious."
209964,L333474,u6190,m413,KAFKA,And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
209965,L333472,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher."
209966,L333471,u6193,m413,MURNAU,I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
209967,L333470,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"""Accident and Compensation"" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises."
209968,L333469,u6193,m413,MURNAU,-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
209969,L333467,u6190,m413,KAFKA,It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
209970,L333466,u6193,m413,MURNAU,-- You seem amused.
209971,L333465,u6193,m413,MURNAU,"You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority."
209972,L333464,u6190,m413,KAFKA,... A piece of paper ...
209973,L333463,u6193,m413,MURNAU,"Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one."
209974,L333462,u6193,m413,MURNAU,"A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?"
209975,L333461,u6190,m413,KAFKA,... A piece of paper ...
209976,L333370,u6191,m413,KEEPER,"It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm."
209977,L333369,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I could always apply there.
209978,L333368,u6191,m413,KEEPER,"We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section."
209979,L333367,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Where do our records go to in the Castle?
209980,L333366,u6191,m413,KEEPER,"You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious."
209981,L333365,u6190,m413,KAFKA,What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
209982,L333364,u6191,m413,KEEPER,These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
209983,L333363,u6190,m413,KAFKA,What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
209984,L333362,u6191,m413,KEEPER,Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
209985,L333361,u6190,m413,KAFKA,"Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?"
209986,L333360,u6191,m413,KEEPER,Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
209987,L333359,u6190,m413,KAFKA,This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
209988,L333358,u6191,m413,KEEPER,Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
209989,L333357,u6190,m413,KAFKA,I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
209990,L333356,u6191,m413,KEEPER,"You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!"
209991,L333355,u6190,m413,KAFKA,All these in the last year?
209992,L333352,u6191,m413,KEEPER,"It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion."
209993,L333351,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Orlac is an account?
209994,L333350,u6191,m413,KEEPER,If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
209995,L333335,u6190,m413,KAFKA,-- You mean my Chief has it.
209996,L333334,u6191,m413,KEEPER,"Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off."
209997,L333333,u6190,m413,KAFKA,It's gone out so quickly?
209998,L333332,u6191,m413,KEEPER,Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
209999,L333331,u6190,m413,KAFKA,What's the matter?
210000,L333330,u6190,m413,KAFKA,He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
210001,L333329,u6191,m413,KEEPER,"Wait a minute.  ""Raban?""  Where have I heard that name?"
210002,L333328,u6190,m413,KAFKA,Yes.  Isn't it there?
210003,L333327,u6191,m413,KEEPER,"I'm overworked as it is.  ""Raban"" did you say?"
210004,L333326,u6191,m413,KEEPER,"I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time."
210005,L333325,u6190,m413,KAFKA,It usually is.
210006,L333324,u6191,m413,KEEPER,"""Raban"" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet."
210007,L333530,u6194,m413,OSKAR,Amerika!
210008,L333529,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,Amerika for us!
210009,L333528,u6194,m413,OSKAR,Then that's the place for us!
210010,L333525,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,What's to become of us now?
210011,L333524,u6194,m413,OSKAR,It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
210012,L333523,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,I understand he was wounded in the lung.
210013,L333522,u6194,m413,OSKAR,They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
210014,L333521,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
210015,L333495,u6194,m413,OSKAR,Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
210016,L333494,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,This is filed incorrectly!
210017,L333493,u6194,m413,OSKAR,Ludwig?
210018,L333492,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,Oskar!
210019,L333411,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
210020,L333410,u6194,m413,OSKAR,But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
210021,L333382,u6194,m413,OSKAR,-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
210022,L333381,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
210023,L333377,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,And we're upset too.
210024,L333376,u6194,m413,OSKAR,It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
210025,L333227,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,It's not too bad working here.
210026,L333226,u6194,m413,OSKAR,"We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them."
210027,L333225,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
210028,L333222,u6194,m413,OSKAR,She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
210029,L333221,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,Women are all you have on your mind!
210030,L333218,u6194,m413,OSKAR,Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
210031,L333217,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,You look tired.
210032,L333216,u6194,m413,OSKAR,He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
210033,L333121,u6194,m413,OSKAR,Oskar.
210034,L333120,u6192,m413,LUDWIG,Ludwig.
210035,L335470,u6197,m414,DENHAM,Now Ann ...
210036,L335469,u6196,m414,ANN,Get the hell out of here.''!
210037,L335465,u6196,m414,ANN,Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
210038,L335464,u6197,m414,DENHAM,Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
210039,L335274,u6196,m414,ANN,"To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible."
210040,L335273,u6197,m414,DENHAM,"I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - ""The Lord Darrow Benefit screening"". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!"
210041,L335272,u6197,m414,DENHAM,Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
210042,L335271,u6196,m414,ANN,It's ... lovely.
210043,L335270,u6197,m414,DENHAM,I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
210044,L335234,u6197,m414,DENHAM,"Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap."
210045,L335233,u6196,m414,ANN,Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
210046,L335223,u6197,m414,DENHAM,"Does this look like the ""Queen Mary""?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!"
210047,L335222,u6196,m414,ANN,"There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!"
210048,L335221,u6197,m414,DENHAM,"You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!"
210049,L335220,u6196,m414,ANN,I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
210050,L335131,u6196,m414,ANN,Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
210051,L335130,u6197,m414,DENHAM,"Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me."
210052,L335152,u6201,m414,LORD DARROW,"Now now, Ann! Try be to polite."
210053,L335151,u6196,m414,ANN,"Oh God, it's that bloody yank!"
210054,L335148,u6201,m414,LORD DARROW,"All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London."
210055,L335147,u6196,m414,ANN,Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ...  organize an expedition -
210056,L335122,u6196,m414,ANN,Father ... Father!
210057,L335121,u6201,m414,LORD DARROW,Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
210058,L335119,u6201,m414,LORD DARROW,These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
210059,L335118,u6196,m414,ANN,Father!
210060,L335058,u6201,m414,LORD DARROW,"Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology."
210061,L335057,u6196,m414,ANN,"I photographed it extensively, father."
210062,L335056,u6201,m414,LORD DARROW,Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
210063,L335054,u6201,m414,LORD DARROW,"I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann."
210064,L335053,u6196,m414,ANN,A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
210065,L335052,u6201,m414,LORD DARROW,What have you got there?
210066,L335499,u6196,m414,ANN,It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
210067,L335498,u6199,m414,JACK,Ann ... Ann!
210068,L335486,u6196,m414,ANN,You're the animals - all of you!

210070,L335484,u6196,m414,ANN,He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
210071,L335483,u6199,m414,JACK,"Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!"
210072,L335482,u6196,m414,ANN,Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
210073,L335427,u6196,m414,ANN,Jack!...  Jack!
210074,L335426,u6199,m414,JACK,Barricade the gates! Quick!
210075,L335326,u6196,m414,ANN,No! Don't!
210076,L335325,u6199,m414,JACK,I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
210077,L335324,u6196,m414,ANN,Give it back!
210078,L335323,u6199,m414,JACK,This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
210079,L335322,u6196,m414,ANN,Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
210080,L335321,u6199,m414,JACK,Oh Jesus ... you took it.
210081,L335320,u6199,m414,JACK,Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
210082,L335319,u6196,m414,ANN,"But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information."
210083,L335318,u6199,m414,JACK,We're leaving.

210086,L335295,u6196,m414,ANN,It's the same image - Kong!
210087,L335283,u6199,m414,JACK,Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
210088,L335282,u6196,m414,ANN,There's a light up ahead.
210089,L335268,u6199,m414,JACK,Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
210090,L335267,u6196,m414,ANN,I can't imagine you crying.
210091,L335266,u6199,m414,JACK,It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
210092,L335265,u6196,m414,ANN,I want to thank you.
210093,L335250,u6199,m414,JACK,"When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage."
210094,L335249,u6196,m414,ANN,"I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard."
210095,L335248,u6199,m414,JACK,Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
210096,L335209,u6199,m414,JACK,Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
210097,L335208,u6196,m414,ANN,Can you fly?
210098,L335205,u6196,m414,ANN,"I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!"
210099,L335204,u6199,m414,JACK,There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
210100,L335203,u6196,m414,ANN,Where do I charter a boat?
210101,L335187,u6196,m414,ANN,No!
210102,L335186,u6199,m414,JACK,I'm sorry ...
210103,L335171,u6199,m414,JACK,Value? ... Value?
210104,L335170,u6196,m414,ANN,"God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!"
210105,L335169,u6199,m414,JACK,Do they have him on display at the weekends?
210106,L335168,u6196,m414,ANN,How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
210107,L335167,u6199,m414,JACK,Holy God! The mummy walks!
210108,L335165,u6196,m414,ANN,"Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?"
210109,L335164,u6199,m414,JACK,"You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!"
210110,L335163,u6196,m414,ANN,"No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!"
210111,L335162,u6199,m414,JACK,"I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?"
210112,L335161,u6196,m414,ANN,"He's grubbing for money, father."
210113,L335411,u6198,m414,ENGLEHORN,Oh my God ... Ann?
210114,L335410,u6197,m414,DENHAM,They' re dead.
210115,L335409,u6198,m414,ENGLEHORN,Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?
210116,L335315,u6197,m414,DENHAM,"We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!"
210117,L335314,u6198,m414,ENGLEHORN,"They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here."
210118,L335253,u6197,m414,DENHAM,"Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!"
210119,L335252,u6198,m414,ENGLEHORN,I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
210120,L335216,u6198,m414,ENGLEHORN,Two... maybe three.
210121,L335215,u6197,m414,DENHAM,"I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?"
210122,L335214,u6198,m414,ENGLEHORN,There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
210123,L335143,u6197,m414,DENHAM,We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
210124,L335142,u6198,m414,ENGLEHORN,I tell you it doesn't exist!
210125,L335141,u6197,m414,DENHAM,"What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  ""Skull Island""  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!"
210126,L335140,u6198,m414,ENGLEHORN,"Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here."
210127,L335113,u6197,m414,DENHAM,"A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb"
210128,L335112,u6202,m414,MR GINTING,Man Eater!!!

210186,L335857,u6215,m415,TRINA,"Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!"

210207,L336012,u6204,m415,BREE,"I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?"
210208,L336011,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,Didn't want you.
210209,L336010,u6204,m415,BREE,"The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me."
210210,L336009,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,You think people hate you.
210211,L336008,u6204,m415,BREE,Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.

210213,L336006,u6204,m415,BREE,Do you always have to repeat?
210214,L336005,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,Don't belong?

210216,L335999,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
210217,L335998,u6204,m415,BREE,I do not love him.
210218,L335997,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,"Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --"

210220,L335995,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,I'd just be guessing.
210221,L335994,u6204,m415,BREE,"I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?"
210222,L336195,u6209,m415,LELA,Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.

210238,L336117,u6214,m415,TRASK,I guess he figured it was better.
210239,L336116,u6204,m415,BREE,Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
210240,L336115,u6214,m415,TRASK,"We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more."
210241,L336114,u6204,m415,BREE,Why isn't he locked up?

Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?"
210257,L336242,u6204,m415,BREE,If you'll let me go I could tell them what --

So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago."
210462,L335697,u6208,m415,KLUTE,-- Tuscarora --
210463,L335696,u6204,m415,BREE,"A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --"
210464,L335694,u6204,m415,BREE,Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
210465,L335693,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Company outing or picnic or something like that.
210466,L335688,u6204,m415,BREE,Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
210467,L335687,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Could I ask some questions?
210468,L335686,u6204,m415,BREE,If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
210469,L335685,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"No, I'm look --"
210470,L335684,u6204,m415,BREE,"Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it."
210471,L335624,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Mm.
210472,L335623,u6204,m415,BREE,And you just want to ask me a few questions?
210473,L335622,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Mm.
210474,L335621,u6204,m415,BREE,You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
210475,L335620,u6204,m415,BREE,Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
210476,L335619,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Will you let me ask you some questions?
210477,L335618,u6204,m415,BREE,Honest?
210478,L335617,u6208,m415,KLUTE,You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
210479,L335616,u6204,m415,BREE,Why?
210480,L335615,u6208,m415,KLUTE,He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
210481,L335614,u6204,m415,BREE,Gee.
210482,L335613,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
210483,L335612,u6204,m415,BREE,Who?
210484,L335611,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
210485,L335610,u6204,m415,BREE,You said that.
210486,L335609,u6208,m415,KLUTE,My name's John Klute.
210487,L335608,u6204,m415,BREE,What about?
210488,L335606,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
210489,L335605,u6204,m415,BREE,What is it?
210490,L336171,u6205,m415,CABLE,Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
210491,L336170,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Well --
210492,L336169,u6205,m415,CABLE,"No, I'd -- like to be in on it."
210493,L336168,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Just send me a money order.
210494,L336167,u6205,m415,CABLE,Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
210495,L336166,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street."
210496,L336165,u6205,m415,CABLE,I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
210497,L336162,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"All right, but I'm going to see that list."
210498,L336161,u6205,m415,CABLE,"Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed."
210499,L336160,u6208,m415,KLUTE,It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
210500,L336159,u6205,m415,CABLE,No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
210501,L336158,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
210502,L336157,u6205,m415,CABLE,I can't follow you.
210503,L336156,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
210504,L336155,u6205,m415,CABLE,You were hired to look for Tom.
210505,L336154,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time."
210506,L336153,u6205,m415,CABLE,What?
210507,L336152,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book."
210508,L336151,u6205,m415,CABLE,"You were hired to look for Tom, not someone."
210509,L336150,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Someone's been doing all these things.
210510,L336149,u6205,m415,CABLE,"You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom."
210511,L336148,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew."
210512,L336147,u6205,m415,CABLE,That who?
210513,L336146,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
210514,L336145,u6205,m415,CABLE,You must be discouraged.
210515,L336144,u6208,m415,KLUTE,No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
210516,L336143,u6205,m415,CABLE,Some mistake perhaps that --
210517,L336142,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB."
210518,L336141,u6205,m415,CABLE,"It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --"
210519,L336140,u6208,m415,KLUTE,It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
210520,L336139,u6205,m415,CABLE,I'm sorry. I don't understand.
210521,L336138,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
210522,L336137,u6205,m415,CABLE,You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
210523,L336136,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"Yeah, two things Pete, that --"
210524,L336135,u6205,m415,CABLE,I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
210525,L336134,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Yeah.
210526,L336133,u6205,m415,CABLE,"I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me."
210527,L336132,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Well as a matter of --
210528,L336131,u6205,m415,CABLE,"I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --"
210529,L336130,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Well there's a couple --
210530,L336129,u6205,m415,CABLE,Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
210531,L335931,u6205,m415,CABLE,"I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you."
210532,L335930,u6208,m415,KLUTE,How is it back there?
210533,L335929,u6205,m415,CABLE,I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
210534,L335926,u6208,m415,KLUTE,It's got to make sense some way.
210535,L335925,u6205,m415,CABLE,"You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom."
210536,L335924,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
210537,L335923,u6205,m415,CABLE,"Where, how?"
210538,L335922,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I better keep looking.
210539,L335921,u6205,m415,CABLE,"Then, close the case."
210540,L335920,u6208,m415,KLUTE,It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
210541,L335919,u6205,m415,CABLE,"All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?"
210542,L335916,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"I believed her, Pete."
210543,L335915,u6205,m415,CABLE,She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
210544,L336048,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"Goodbye, Pete."
210545,L336047,u6206,m415,CABLE'S VOICE,"Thank you. Goodbye, John."
210546,L336046,u6208,m415,KLUTE,All right.
210547,L336045,u6206,m415,CABLE'S VOICE,"All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?"
210548,L336044,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I wanted to give it to you first.
210549,L336043,u6206,m415,CABLE'S VOICE,Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
210550,L336042,u6208,m415,KLUTE,It's in the report.
210551,L336041,u6206,m415,CABLE'S VOICE,Have you discussed this with them?
210552,L336040,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --"
210553,L336039,u6206,m415,CABLE'S VOICE,I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
210554,L336036,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
210555,L336035,u6206,m415,CABLE'S VOICE,What's in it?
210556,L336034,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
210557,L336033,u6208,m415,KLUTE,It's not so bad.
210558,L336032,u6206,m415,CABLE'S VOICE,It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
210559,L336031,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
210560,L336030,u6206,m415,CABLE'S VOICE,"John, how are you?"
210561,L335781,u6207,m415,FRANK,Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
210562,L335780,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
210563,L335779,u6207,m415,FRANK,"You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote."
210564,L335778,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?"
210565,L335777,u6207,m415,FRANK,"OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards."
210566,L335776,u6208,m415,KLUTE,She told me.
210567,L335775,u6207,m415,FRANK,"OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree."
210568,L335774,u6207,m415,FRANK,Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
210569,L335773,u6208,m415,KLUTE,They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
210570,L335772,u6207,m415,FRANK,Two years ago? Sorry.
210571,L335771,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
210572,L335770,u6207,m415,FRANK,I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
210573,L335769,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I've just got a few --
210574,L335768,u6207,m415,FRANK,I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
210575,L335658,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,"Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction."
210576,L335657,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I think she's trying that.
210577,L335656,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,"No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career."
210578,L335655,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Has she talked with you since prison?
210579,L335654,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,"About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either."
210580,L335653,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Did she talk about him to you?
210581,L335652,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,Not unusual.
210582,L335651,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
210583,L335650,u6212,m415,SPANGLER,"-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?"
210584,L336089,u6208,m415,KLUTE,He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
210585,L336088,u6211,m415,ROSS,Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
210586,L336078,u6211,m415,ROSS,"What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?"
210587,L336077,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
210588,L336076,u6211,m415,ROSS,But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
210589,L335558,u6211,m415,ROSS,"Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question."
210590,L335557,u6208,m415,KLUTE,No.
210591,L335556,u6211,m415,ROSS,Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
210592,L335555,u6208,m415,KLUTE,"Everybody's got some, I guess."
210593,L335554,u6211,m415,ROSS,Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
210594,L335553,u6208,m415,KLUTE,No.
210595,L335552,u6211,m415,ROSS,Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
210596,L335551,u6208,m415,KLUTE,No.
210597,L335550,u6211,m415,ROSS,Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
210598,L335549,u6208,m415,KLUTE,We grew up together. Kids.
210599,L335548,u6211,m415,ROSS,You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
210600,L335547,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I know Tom Grunemann.
210601,L335546,u6211,m415,ROSS,Then how are you involved?
210602,L335545,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Town Police.
210603,L335544,u6211,m415,ROSS,"Are you with plant security, Sergeant?"
210604,L335543,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
210605,L336087,u6214,m415,TRASK,"If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter."
210606,L336086,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Nobody's seen that.
210607,L336085,u6214,m415,TRASK,It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
210608,L336084,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I left them here. I was doing some work here.
210609,L336083,u6214,m415,TRASK,"Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway."
210610,L336027,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I don't believe Tom's alive.
210611,L336026,u6214,m415,TRASK,"We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body."
210612,L336025,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
210613,L336024,u6214,m415,TRASK,What else do you know?
210614,L336023,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
210615,L336022,u6214,m415,TRASK,Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
210616,L336021,u6208,m415,KLUTE,But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
210617,L336018,u6214,m415,TRASK,Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
210618,L336017,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
210619,L336016,u6214,m415,TRASK,Think this is our guy?
210620,L335952,u6208,m415,KLUTE,Yeah.
210621,L335951,u6214,m415,TRASK,Well?
210622,L335950,u6208,m415,KLUTE,I looked it up.
210623,L335949,u6214,m415,TRASK,"That's how the other one died, you know. In the water."

210814,L337380,u6217,m416,BILLY,What if she forgets?
210815,L337379,u6230,m416,TED,"No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim."
210816,L337378,u6217,m416,BILLY,Will she pick me up after school?
210817,L337377,u6230,m416,TED,"Soon.  I told you before, very soon."
210818,L337376,u6217,m416,BILLY,When is mommy coming back?
210819,L337371,u6230,m416,TED,Right.  One O.J. coming up.
210820,L337370,u6217,m416,BILLY,What about my orange juice?
210821,L337368,u6230,m416,TED,That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
210822,L337367,u6217,m416,BILLY,You forgot the milk.
210823,L337364,u6230,m416,TED,"Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right?"
210824,L337363,u6217,m416,BILLY,"Wow!  French toast, really?"
210825,L337362,u6230,m416,TED,"I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?"
210826,L337361,u6230,m416,TED,Soon.  Very soon.
210827,L337360,u6217,m416,BILLY,When is mommy coming back?
210828,L337358,u6230,m416,TED,"Oh, Christ...Ah, yeah...you want to know why mom's not here, right?"
210829,L337357,u6217,m416,BILLY,The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
210830,L337356,u6230,m416,TED,Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
210831,L338061,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Then I have concluded my questions.
210832,L338060,u6221,m416,JUDGE,"No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning."
210833,L338059,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Does the witness deny the injury took place?
210834,L338058,u6221,m416,JUDGE,"This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise."
210835,L338057,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"I do not, your honor, however--"
210836,L338056,u6221,m416,JUDGE,"I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?"
210837,L338055,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Yes, your honor."
210838,L338054,u6221,m416,JUDGE,"Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?"
210839,L338042,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?"
210840,L338041,u6221,m416,JUDGE,Sustained.
210841,L337981,u6221,m416,JUDGE,Overruled.
210842,L337980,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Objection!
210843,L337967,u6221,m416,JUDGE,Sustained.
210844,L337966,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
210845,L337956,u6221,m416,JUDGE,"Overruled.  The witness will answer, please."
210846,L337955,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Objection!
210847,L337929,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?"
210848,L337928,u6220,m416,JOANNA,"Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father."
210849,L337927,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?"
210850,L337926,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California."
210851,L337925,u6220,m416,JOANNA,"Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother."
210852,L337924,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,And yet you chose to leave him?
210853,L337923,u6220,m416,JOANNA,Yes.  Very much.
210854,L337922,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?"
210855,L337921,u6220,m416,JOANNA,I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
210856,L337920,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,And what is your present salary?
210857,L337919,u6220,m416,JOANNA,"Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer."
210858,L337918,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?"
210859,L337917,u6220,m416,JOANNA,"Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy."
210860,L337916,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Did you wish to?
210861,L337915,u6220,m416,JOANNA,"No, I did not."
210862,L337914,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?"
210863,L337913,u6220,m416,JOANNA,"The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult."
210864,L337912,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,And would you describe those years as happy?
210865,L337911,u6220,m416,JOANNA,Six years.
210866,L337910,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?"
210867,L338053,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred."
210868,L338052,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings."
210869,L338048,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job."
210870,L338047,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness."
210871,L338040,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,Objection!
210872,L338039,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,So do I.
210873,L338034,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,No questions.
210874,L338033,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
210875,L338031,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
210876,L338030,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague."
210877,L337987,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?"
210878,L337986,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Objection!
210879,L337969,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Objection!
210880,L337968,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?"
210881,L337960,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?"
210882,L337959,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Objection!
210883,L337948,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?"
210884,L337947,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Objection.
210885,L338004,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,Thank you.  I have no further questions.
210886,L338003,u6222,m416,O'CONNOR,"Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office."
210887,L338002,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,And yet you fired him.
210888,L338001,u6222,m416,O'CONNOR,"It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler."
210889,L338000,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,And how did you find his work?
210890,L337999,u6222,m416,O'CONNOR,Yes...
210891,L337998,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,And did you have a close personal relationship?
210892,L337997,u6222,m416,O'CONNOR,"Eight, almost nine years."
210893,L337996,u6218,m416,GRESSEN,"Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?"
210894,L337792,u6219,m416,INTERVIEWER,"My, we are a hot shot aren't we?"
210895,L337791,u6230,m416,TED,"Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission."
210896,L337790,u6219,m416,INTERVIEWER,"Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--"
210897,L337789,u6230,m416,TED,Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
210898,L337788,u6219,m416,INTERVIEWER,There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
210899,L337770,u6219,m416,INTERVIEWER,I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
210900,L337769,u6230,m416,TED,"Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--"
210901,L337768,u6219,m416,INTERVIEWER,"Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus."
210902,L337767,u6230,m416,TED,"What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand."
210903,L337766,u6219,m416,INTERVIEWER,"Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job."
210904,L337992,u6220,m416,JOANNA,Yes.
210905,L337991,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,Were you?
210906,L337985,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer."
210907,L337984,u6220,m416,JOANNA,I consider it less my failure than his.
210908,L337983,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.
210909,L337982,u6220,m416,JOANNA,I was not a failure.
210910,L337979,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life."
210911,L337978,u6220,m416,JOANNA,We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
210912,L337977,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,How long was that?
210913,L337976,u6220,m416,JOANNA,Yes.
210914,L337975,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you."
210915,L337974,u6220,m416,JOANNA,I suppose...
210916,L337973,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?"
210917,L337965,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say ""permanently"" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent."
210918,L337964,u6220,m416,JOANNA,I...I don't know...
210919,L337963,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,Is that...permanent?
210920,L337958,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,Do you have a lover now?
210921,L337957,u6220,m416,JOANNA,Somewhere in between.
210922,L337954,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?"
210923,L337953,u6220,m416,JOANNA,I don't recall.
210924,L337952,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
210925,L337951,u6220,m416,JOANNA,I don't recall.
210926,L337946,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Well, I can certainly understand why you left him."
210927,L337945,u6220,m416,JOANNA,No.
210928,L337944,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,Did he ever fail to provide for you?
210929,L337943,u6220,m416,JOANNA,No.
210930,L337942,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,Was he unfaithful?
210931,L337941,u6220,m416,JOANNA,No.
210932,L337940,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,A heavy drinker?
210933,L337939,u6220,m416,JOANNA,No.
210934,L337938,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
210935,L337937,u6220,m416,JOANNA,No.
210936,L337936,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
210937,L337935,u6220,m416,JOANNA,No.
210938,L337934,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
210939,L337933,u6220,m416,JOANNA,Yes.
210940,L337932,u6226,m416,SHAUNESSY,"Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?"
210941,L338143,u6230,m416,TED,Beautiful.
210942,L338142,u6220,m416,JOANNA,Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
210943,L338141,u6230,m416,TED,No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
210944,L338140,u6220,m416,JOANNA,Only can I still see him?
210945,L338139,u6230,m416,TED,"Oh, God...Oh, my God..."
210946,L338138,u6220,m416,JOANNA,"He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours..."
210947,L338137,u6230,m416,TED,What?
210948,L338136,u6220,m416,JOANNA,"After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another ""should.""  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you..."
210949,L338135,u6220,m416,JOANNA,Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..

Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself."

211018,L337610,u6230,m416,TED,"All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?"
211019,L337563,u6230,m416,TED,"I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close."
211020,L337562,u6222,m416,O'CONNOR,Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.

And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--"

211033,L337390,u6230,m416,TED,Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
211034,L337389,u6222,m416,O'CONNOR,"Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine."
211035,L337388,u6230,m416,TED,"You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser."

211053,L337836,u6230,m416,TED,But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
211054,L337835,u6223,m416,PHYLLIS,Right.
211055,L337834,u6230,m416,TED,"So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?"

211059,L337605,u6223,m416,PHYLLIS,"Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line."

211064,L337599,u6223,m416,PHYLLIS,You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
211065,L337598,u6230,m416,TED,I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.
211066,L337597,u6223,m416,PHYLLIS,You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
211067,L337595,u6230,m416,TED,What?!?
211068,L337594,u6223,m416,PHYLLIS,O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.

Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:"

211272,L339357,u6243,m417,LUKHANGWA,I will not approve it.
211273,L339356,u6236,m417,GENERAL CHIANG,Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
211274,L339355,u6243,m417,LUKHANGWA,Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
211275,L339354,u6236,m417,GENERAL CHIANG,To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
211276,L339353,u6243,m417,LUKHANGWA,Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
211277,L339352,u6243,m417,LUKHANGWA,"It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian."
211278,L339351,u6236,m417,GENERAL CHIANG,"How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?"
211279,L339350,u6243,m417,LUKHANGWA,"So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs."
211280,L339349,u6236,m417,GENERAL CHIANG,The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
211281,L339348,u6243,m417,LUKHANGWA,"Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp."
211282,L339347,u6236,m417,GENERAL CHIANG,"We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed."
211283,L339346,u6243,m417,LUKHANGWA,"Are you, General?"
211284,L339345,u6236,m417,GENERAL CHIANG,We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
211285,L339344,u6243,m417,LUKHANGWA,You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
211286,L339343,u6236,m417,GENERAL CHIANG,"You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances."
211287,L339311,u6237,m417,GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU,Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
211288,L339310,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Soon.
211289,L339309,u6237,m417,GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU,"Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?"

211291,L339305,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I have.
211292,L339304,u6237,m417,GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU,Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
211293,L339303,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Thank you. Please sit.
211294,L339302,u6237,m417,GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU,We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
211295,L339301,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,General Chiang.
211296,L339300,u6237,m417,GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU,Dalai Lama.
211297,L339317,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?"
211298,L339316,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,"Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India."
211299,L339299,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"Then, we shall meet."
211300,L339298,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,"General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you."
211301,L339297,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Yes.
211302,L339296,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,Holiness?
211303,L339295,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"Yes, but they say he did."
211304,L339294,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
211305,L339285,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Time to study.
211306,L339284,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,Yes.
211307,L339281,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,He is a capable man.
211308,L339280,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,"Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking."
211309,L339279,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
211310,L339278,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,I am afraid.
211311,L339277,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,With much bloodshed.
211312,L339276,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,"Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa."
211313,L339275,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"So, we must face China and all her might alone."
211314,L339271,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
211315,L339270,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,And the United Nations? Surely?
211316,L339268,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,All?
211317,L339267,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,"Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away."
211318,L339124,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,We did not.
211319,L339123,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Did you receive the letter?
211320,L339122,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,"The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the ""Chinese region of Tibet"". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it."
211321,L339121,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,"Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake."
211322,L339116,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,It is calm.
211323,L339115,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,The Sera monks have surrendered?
211324,L339114,u6238,m417,KASHAG MEMBER,"He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness."
211325,L338930,u6246,m417,MOTHER,We do not know.
211326,L338929,u6239,m417,LHAMO,Who am I?
211327,L338915,u6246,m417,MOTHER,"Yes, yes. Your brothers are here."
211328,L338914,u6239,m417,LHAMO,This many?
211329,L338913,u6246,m417,MOTHER,Two.
211330,L338912,u6239,m417,LHAMO,How many?
211331,L338911,u6246,m417,MOTHER,I will be back in a few days.
211332,L338899,u6246,m417,MOTHER,I miss him too.
211333,L338898,u6239,m417,LHAMO,I miss my brother.
211334,L338897,u6246,m417,MOTHER,"You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered."
211335,L338896,u6239,m417,LHAMO,I pooped.
211336,L338895,u6246,m417,MOTHER,"At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink."
211337,L338894,u6239,m417,LHAMO,Me. First break of day.
211338,L338893,u6246,m417,MOTHER,"Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, ""His time has come."""
211339,L338892,u6239,m417,LHAMO,Cow.
211340,L338891,u6246,m417,MOTHER,He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
211341,L338890,u6246,m417,MOTHER,Your father had been very sick.
211342,L338863,u6239,m417,LHAMO,"Far, far away."
211343,L338862,u6246,m417,MOTHER,"Oh, no. Where will he go?"
211344,L339049,u6240,m417,LING RINPOCHE,Answer.
211345,L339048,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I need to squeeze this brain.
211346,L339045,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering."
211347,L339044,u6240,m417,LING RINPOCHE,I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
211348,L339043,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings."
211349,L339042,u6240,m417,LING RINPOCHE,I accept it. What is suffering?
211350,L339041,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering."
211351,L339014,u6241,m417,LOBSANG,Not until you are eighteen.
211352,L339013,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I am him.
211353,L339012,u6241,m417,LOBSANG,You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
211354,L339002,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Do you have money?
211355,L339001,u6241,m417,LOBSANG,What do you think?
211356,L339000,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Do I have money?
211357,L338999,u6241,m417,LOBSANG,You could buy them.
211358,L338998,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
211359,L339431,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
211360,L339430,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
211361,L339424,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun."
211362,L339423,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I will not go.
211363,L339422,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
211364,L339411,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,The people will not allow it.
211365,L339410,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,They will take Lhasa next.
211366,L339400,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not."
211367,L339399,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
211368,L339398,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes."
211369,L339397,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
211370,L339396,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
211371,L339395,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
211372,L339394,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight."
211373,L339393,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns."
211374,L339390,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I had relinquished doubt.
211375,L339389,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,Did you ever doubt it?
211376,L339325,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change."
211377,L339324,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?"
211378,L339323,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I am scared.
211379,L339321,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have."
211380,L339320,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
211381,L339319,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war."
211382,L339318,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America."
211383,L339283,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
211384,L339282,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
211385,L339274,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,In the Americas.
211386,L339273,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Where is that?
211387,L339272,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called ""El Salvador""."
211388,L339169,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, ""The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming."" And then, the radio went dead."
211389,L339168,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Has anyone died?
211390,L339167,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area."
211391,L339166,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"What is the size of our army, now?"
211392,L339136,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem."
211393,L339135,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,Quite simple. Yes. Good.
211394,L339134,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
211395,L339133,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"America, we shall see."
211396,L339132,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"And, America?"
211397,L339131,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,Britain chooses not to.
211398,L339130,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Britain?
211399,L339129,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
211400,L339128,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Can India help us?
211401,L339127,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
211402,L339126,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself."
211403,L339125,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
211404,L339120,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"What is the danger from the Chinese, now?"
211405,L339119,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,Ask whatever you will.
211406,L339118,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
211407,L339107,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
211408,L339106,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,What can I do? I am only a boy.
211409,L339098,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Look here!
211410,L339097,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun."
211411,L339086,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,When it is time.
211412,L339085,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Tell me.
211413,L339084,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,He warned about the future of Tibet.
211414,L339083,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
211415,L339078,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"I do not know, Holiness."
211416,L339077,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Where is Alsace?
211417,L339076,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,It is an island. American territory.
211418,L339075,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,In the Pacific Ocean.
211419,L339065,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Will we ever be in war?
211420,L339064,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,No. This war is almost over.
211421,L339063,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Will we be in this war?
211422,L339062,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too."
211423,L339061,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,No. Not very big.
211424,L339060,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Is that big?
211425,L339059,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,Roughly five thousand men.
211426,L339058,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,How big is Tibet's army?
211427,L339057,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Please.
211428,L339056,u6242,m417,LORD CHAMBERLAIN,"May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?"
211429,L338869,u6244,m417,MAN,Thank you.
211430,L338868,u6246,m417,MOTHER,"Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen."
211431,L338867,u6244,m417,MAN,We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
211432,L338866,u6246,m417,MOTHER,"Please, come in, so cold."
211433,L338865,u6244,m417,MAN,Good day.
211434,L338864,u6246,m417,MOTHER,Good day.
211435,L339384,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Always.
211436,L339383,u6245,m417,MAO TSE TUNG,"You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan."
211437,L339382,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
211438,L339381,u6245,m417,MAO TSE TUNG,"Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?"
211439,L339380,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I leave tomorrow.
211440,L339379,u6245,m417,MAO TSE TUNG,"Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late."
211441,L339376,u6245,m417,MAO TSE TUNG,Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
211442,L339375,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"For me, I think such a mix is crucial."
211443,L339374,u6245,m417,MAO TSE TUNG,"You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix."
211444,L339373,u6245,m417,MAO TSE TUNG,"Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China."
211445,L339372,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay."
211446,L339371,u6245,m417,MAO TSE TUNG,"It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary."
211447,L339370,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
211448,L339369,u6245,m417,MAO TSE TUNG,You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
211449,L339427,u6246,m417,MOTHER,You decide.
211450,L339426,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Do you think I must?
211451,L339029,u6246,m417,MOTHER,I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
211452,L339028,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,You will always!
211453,L339027,u6246,m417,MOTHER,Me?
211454,L339026,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,But you will always be here?
211455,L339025,u6246,m417,MOTHER,"I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us."
211456,L339024,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
211457,L339023,u6246,m417,MOTHER,"Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen."
211458,L339022,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is ""lavish"" and ""willful"". ""How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"""
211459,L339021,u6246,m417,MOTHER,I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.
211460,L339264,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
211461,L339263,u6247,m417,NOBLE BOY,What does the butter spot feel like?
211462,L339262,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,You decide.
211463,L339261,u6247,m417,NOBLE BOY,True.
211464,L339260,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,What do you think?
211465,L339259,u6247,m417,NOBLE BOY,"Is that a true story, or pretend?"
211466,L339258,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"He does, a little spot where the butter had been."
211467,L339257,u6247,m417,NOBLE BOY,Does he have the spot?
211468,L339256,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born."
211469,L339219,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
211470,L339218,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,You have grown up very good.
211471,L339217,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,We have.
211472,L339216,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,"We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace."
211473,L339215,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I will miss you.
211474,L339214,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,"You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time."
211475,L339212,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
211476,L339211,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Am I running away?
211477,L339210,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,"No, Holiness."
211478,L339209,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,You will not come?
211479,L339179,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,"Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?"
211480,L339178,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"But, I have no experience."
211481,L339177,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
211482,L339176,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"Then, I am lucky. I am still too young."
211483,L339175,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,The people want you made Dalai Lama.
211484,L339096,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,"Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army."
211485,L339095,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
211486,L339080,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,Ahh.
211487,L339079,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,This is Tibet. And this is China.
211488,L339073,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Where is Poland?
211489,L339072,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,Ahh.
211490,L339071,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,This is Britain.
211491,L339069,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing."
211492,L339068,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,Yes.
211493,L339067,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,The Chinese.
211494,L339066,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,We have enemies.
211495,L338986,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,I would not know. Maybe.
211496,L338985,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama."
211497,L338984,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,"But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama."
211498,L338983,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside."
211499,L338982,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,You cannot.
211500,L338981,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
211501,L338980,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
211502,L338979,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I want to go down there.
211503,L338975,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,As you say.
211504,L338974,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Pretend.
211505,L338973,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,"It is a story, you decide."
211506,L338972,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Is that true or pretend?
211507,L338971,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,"She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads."
211508,L338955,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
211509,L338954,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,"Things change, Kundun."
211510,L338952,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,I have smarter men.
211511,L338951,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I have more men.
211512,L338950,u6248,m417,NORBU THUNDRUP,I am braver.
211513,L338949,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger."
211514,L338948,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
211515,L339201,u6249,m417,TAKSTER RINPOCHE,It may not be your decision to make.
211516,L339200,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,How could I ever leave?
211517,L339199,u6249,m417,TAKSTER RINPOCHE,You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
211518,L339198,u6249,m417,TAKSTER RINPOCHE,These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
211519,L339197,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
211520,L339196,u6249,m417,TAKSTER RINPOCHE,This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
211521,L339195,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,We cannot.
211522,L339194,u6249,m417,TAKSTER RINPOCHE,The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
211523,L339193,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now."
211524,L339192,u6249,m417,TAKSTER RINPOCHE,I do.
211525,L339191,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?"
211526,L339190,u6249,m417,TAKSTER RINPOCHE,Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
211527,L339188,u6249,m417,TAKSTER RINPOCHE,Eliminate you.
211528,L339187,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"You, kill me?"
211529,L339186,u6249,m417,TAKSTER RINPOCHE,"They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you."
211530,L339185,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Tell me.
211531,L339155,u6250,m417,TAKTRA RINPOCHE,Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
211532,L339154,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?"
211533,L339153,u6250,m417,TAKTRA RINPOCHE,It is a difficult situation.
211534,L339152,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?"
211535,L339151,u6250,m417,TAKTRA RINPOCHE,"What would you do, Holiness?"
211536,L339150,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost."
211537,L339113,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
211538,L339112,u6250,m417,TAKTRA RINPOCHE,Completely.
211539,L339111,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,You are unharmed?
211540,L339110,u6250,m417,TAKTRA RINPOCHE,"It is possible, Holiness."
211541,L339109,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life."
211542,L339255,u6252,m417,TIBETAN WOMAN,I see that.
211543,L339254,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Like my mother.
211544,L339253,u6252,m417,TIBETAN WOMAN,"Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart."
211545,L339252,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Much too young.
211546,L339251,u6252,m417,TIBETAN WOMAN,Too young?
211547,L339250,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,No.
211548,L339248,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Does he treat you fairly?
211549,L339247,u6252,m417,TIBETAN WOMAN,The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
211550,L339246,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,Hmm.
211551,L339245,u6252,m417,TIBETAN WOMAN,"I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now."
211552,L339244,u6251,m417,TENZIN GYATSO,"Did you love your husband, before you married?"
211553,L340828,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
211554,L340827,u6257,m418,JACK,"We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am."
211555,L340826,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
211556,L340735,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,No.  Do you?
211557,L340734,u6257,m418,JACK,He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
211558,L340328,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,"Oh, yes."
211559,L340327,u6257,m418,JACK,You killed him.
211560,L340326,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,Oh yes.  I killed him.
211561,L340325,u6257,m418,JACK,"Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?"
211562,L340825,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Go ahead.
211563,L340824,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,I'll sue you.
211564,L340748,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,"Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat."
211565,L340747,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest."
211566,L340746,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
211567,L340741,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
211568,L340740,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--"
211569,L340737,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,"<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake."
211570,L340736,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?"
211571,L340731,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,"The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing."
211572,L340730,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows."
211573,L340729,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,I haven't broken any laws.
211574,L340330,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,"Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead."
211575,L340329,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?"
211576,L340320,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,"Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead."
211577,L340319,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman."
211578,L340318,u6254,m418,BICKERMAN,"Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago."
211579,L340765,u6256,m418,HECTOR,<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
211580,L340764,u6255,m418,GARE,Go!!!
211581,L340760,u6255,m418,GARE,Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
211582,L340759,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide."
211583,L340758,u6255,m418,GARE,I might get a shot.
211584,L340745,u6256,m418,HECTOR,He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
211585,L340744,u6255,m418,GARE,"<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water."
211586,L340743,u6256,m418,HECTOR,I need to see his habitat.
211587,L340742,u6255,m418,GARE,C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
211588,L340704,u6255,m418,GARE,<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
211589,L340703,u6256,m418,HECTOR,'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
211590,L340702,u6255,m418,GARE,Why are we landing?
211591,L340701,u6256,m418,HECTOR,It happens when I land.
211592,L340700,u6255,m418,GARE,It seems like we're getting lower.
211593,L340449,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity."
211594,L340448,u6255,m418,GARE,Thank you.
211595,L340447,u6256,m418,HECTOR,You're a beautiful woman.
211596,L340902,u6256,m418,HECTOR,I don't know!
211597,L340901,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Where is he?!
211598,L340899,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank."
211599,L340898,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
211600,L340897,u6256,m418,HECTOR,No!
211601,L340806,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive."
211602,L340805,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Gee, that would really disappoint me."
211603,L340779,u6256,m418,HECTOR,So profound and fat.
211604,L340778,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker."
211605,L340777,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Then do it!!
211606,L340776,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I can arrest you!!
211607,L340683,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Raincheck.
211608,L340682,u6256,m418,HECTOR,That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
211609,L340681,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me."
211610,L340680,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--"
211611,L340679,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
211612,L340678,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?"
211613,L340666,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,It came from across the lake.
211614,L340665,u6256,m418,HECTOR,What's that?
211615,L340621,u6256,m418,HECTOR,<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
211616,L340620,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
211617,L340619,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
211618,L340613,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
211619,L340612,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Asia?  How... how could he get here?
211620,L340604,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?"
211621,L340603,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Promise you won't kill me, first."
211622,L340581,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
211623,L340580,u6256,m418,HECTOR,This is a setback.
211624,L340577,u6256,m418,HECTOR,I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
211625,L340576,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,His head was just... bitten off.
211626,L340575,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
211627,L340574,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Yup.
211628,L340573,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Was he a good man?
211629,L340527,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log."
211630,L340526,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck."
211631,L340518,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him."
211632,L340517,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Is this a trick?
211633,L340516,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt."
211634,L340515,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
211635,L340511,u6256,m418,HECTOR,No crocodile has ever--
211636,L340510,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"That ""Walt"" guy got hit underwater--"
211637,L340509,u6256,m418,HECTOR,They don't really attack underwater and--
211638,L340508,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense."
211639,L340490,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"This could end up saving your life,--"
211640,L340489,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"I coulda shot you, you--"
211641,L340488,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--"
211642,L340487,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,A spring trap!
211643,L340486,u6256,m418,HECTOR,I'm laying a spring trap!
211644,L340485,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,You're crawling around like a--
211645,L340484,u6256,m418,HECTOR,What are <u>you</u> doing?!
211646,L340483,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,What the hell are you doing?!!
211647,L340482,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Jesus Christ!!
211648,L340461,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so."
211649,L340460,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I do <u>not</u> like you.
211650,L340459,u6256,m418,HECTOR,And you like me.
211651,L340458,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
211652,L340457,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,No!!  Out!
211653,L340456,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse."
211654,L340455,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!"
211655,L340454,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it."
211656,L340453,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
211657,L340452,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Cocktail?
211658,L340451,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,We are here on official business.
211659,L340437,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend."
211660,L340436,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Keystone what?
211661,L340435,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species."
211662,L340434,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,We'd only just met.
211663,L340409,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source."
211664,L340408,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Around here.  Yeah.
211665,L340405,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?"
211666,L340404,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,And what would he do come winter?
211667,L340403,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time."
211668,L340402,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
211669,L340395,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?"
211670,L340394,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Mr. Cyr!
211671,L340393,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--"
211672,L340388,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done."
211673,L340387,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
211674,L340386,u6256,m418,HECTOR,I'll need any and all topographic studies.
211675,L340385,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
211676,L340937,u6257,m418,JACK,Just those two.
211677,L340936,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
211678,L340935,u6257,m418,JACK,She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
211679,L340934,u6256,m418,HECTOR,You talk to Bickerman?
211680,L340933,u6257,m418,JACK,You take care.
211681,L340912,u6257,m418,JACK,Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
211682,L340911,u6256,m418,HECTOR,<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
211683,L340884,u6257,m418,JACK,"Tranq guns down, rifles up!"
211684,L340883,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Where is he?
211685,L340867,u6257,m418,JACK,"You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling ""go"" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?"
211686,L340866,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Thank you, Jack."
211687,L340865,u6257,m418,JACK,"Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow."
211688,L340854,u6257,m418,JACK,"Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>."
211689,L340853,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming."
211690,L340852,u6257,m418,JACK,Can you confirm visually or just radar?
211691,L340851,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie."
211692,L340850,u6257,m418,JACK,Where?  Where?
211693,L340848,u6257,m418,JACK,You do?
211694,L340847,u6256,m418,HECTOR,I got something on the screen.
211695,L340838,u6257,m418,JACK,We're ready.
211696,L340837,u6256,m418,HECTOR,You ready on shore?
211697,L340836,u6257,m418,JACK,"The more he thrashes, the better."
211698,L340835,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Right.
211699,L340834,u6257,m418,JACK,"Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim."
211700,L340823,u6256,m418,HECTOR,That's actually the easy part.
211701,L340822,u6257,m418,JACK,And again.  How would you get him on land?
211702,L340818,u6256,m418,HECTOR,We both know what they'll do.
211703,L340817,u6257,m418,JACK,"So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--"
211704,L340816,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant."
211705,L340815,u6257,m418,JACK,No way.
211706,L340810,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--"
211707,L340809,u6257,m418,JACK,<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
211708,L340808,u6256,m418,HECTOR,I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
211709,L340807,u6257,m418,JACK,"Well, you can try talking them into that, if--"
211710,L340773,u6257,m418,JACK,"'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--"
211711,L340772,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--"
211712,L340768,u6257,m418,JACK,Hey!!
211713,L340767,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Bastard bit my chopper.
211714,L340766,u6257,m418,JACK,"This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass."
211715,L340629,u6257,m418,JACK,Get the gun.
211716,L340628,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"He never said ""go""."
211717,L340627,u6257,m418,JACK,Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
211718,L340626,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"At school they'd always say ""go"" first."
211719,L340930,u6256,m418,HECTOR,And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
211720,L340929,u6258,m418,KELLY,Yeah.  Thanks to you.
211721,L340928,u6256,m418,HECTOR,He's gonna live?
211722,L340919,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it."
211723,L340918,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Guess I finally got bit.
211724,L340917,u6258,m418,KELLY,You're gonna be okay.
211725,L340914,u6258,m418,KELLY,"You're not okay, your leg's a mess."
211726,L340913,u6256,m418,HECTOR,I'm okay.
211727,L340814,u6256,m418,HECTOR,We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
211728,L340813,u6258,m418,KELLY,And how would we neutralize him?
211729,L340804,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down."
211730,L340803,u6258,m418,KELLY,They could try to tranq him on land.
211731,L340802,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns."
211732,L340796,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Could we have intercourse?
211733,L340795,u6258,m418,KELLY,What?
211734,L340794,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
211735,L340793,u6258,m418,KELLY,Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
211736,L340792,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Eh.  Fuck it.
211737,L340791,u6258,m418,KELLY,No.
211738,L340790,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
211739,L340789,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Oh, bullshit."
211740,L340788,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--"
211741,L340787,u6258,m418,KELLY,"I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--"
211742,L340786,u6256,m418,HECTOR,With crocodiles... everything's even.
211743,L340785,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--"
211744,L340784,u6258,m418,KELLY,Excuse me?
211745,L340783,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Nothing's real.
211746,L340782,u6258,m418,KELLY,Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
211747,L340781,u6256,m418,HECTOR,You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
211748,L340780,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
211749,L340775,u6256,m418,HECTOR,I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
211750,L340774,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>Jack</u>!
211751,L340611,u6258,m418,KELLY,Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
211752,L340610,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Are you sure?
211753,L340609,u6258,m418,KELLY,He was an Indo-pacific.
211754,L340525,u6256,m418,HECTOR,As if.  Will you miss me?
211755,L340524,u6258,m418,KELLY,What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
211756,L340523,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count."
211757,L340514,u6258,m418,KELLY,I'm just saying last resort.
211758,L340513,u6256,m418,HECTOR,And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
211759,L340512,u6258,m418,KELLY,You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
211760,L340425,u6258,m418,KELLY,U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
211761,L340424,u6256,m418,HECTOR,Such the flirt.
211762,L340421,u6256,m418,HECTOR,What's going on?
211763,L340420,u6258,m418,KELLY,"None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink."
211764,L340412,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>Hector</u>.
211765,L340411,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat."
211766,L340410,u6258,m418,KELLY,"But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway."
211767,L340401,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage."
211768,L340400,u6258,m418,KELLY,I never had sex with you!
211769,L340399,u6256,m418,HECTOR,"If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?"
211770,L340397,u6256,m418,HECTOR,That hurt my feelings.
211771,L340396,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self."
211772,L340969,u6258,m418,KELLY,Good thinking.
211773,L340968,u6257,m418,JACK,"That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can."
211774,L340967,u6258,m418,KELLY,Probably not.
211775,L340966,u6257,m418,JACK,"Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?"
211776,L340965,u6258,m418,KELLY,You think?
211777,L340964,u6257,m418,JACK,"So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up."
211778,L340963,u6258,m418,KELLY,No.
211779,L340962,u6257,m418,JACK,"Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?"
211780,L340961,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Different worlds, Jack."
211781,L340959,u6258,m418,KELLY,Likewise.
211782,L340958,u6257,m418,JACK,It was... something meeting you.
211783,L340957,u6258,m418,KELLY,"But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine."
211784,L340956,u6257,m418,JACK,"Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and..."
211785,L340955,u6258,m418,KELLY,Yeah.
211786,L340954,u6257,m418,JACK,If I'm ever in New York...
211787,L340952,u6258,m418,KELLY,"No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while."
211788,L340951,u6257,m418,JACK,You sure?  I don't mind...
211789,L340948,u6257,m418,JACK,You wanna ride in my truck?
211790,L340947,u6258,m418,KELLY,Well...
211791,L340916,u6258,m418,KELLY,He heeds a tourniquet.
211792,L340915,u6257,m418,JACK,Get him onto shore.
211793,L340910,u6257,m418,JACK,I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
211794,L340909,u6258,m418,KELLY,He's through fighting.  Look at him.
211795,L340882,u6257,m418,JACK,"Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!"
211796,L340881,u6258,m418,KELLY,We gotta get to Hector!!
211797,L340878,u6257,m418,JACK,Take him.
211798,L340877,u6258,m418,KELLY,Hector!!
211799,L340874,u6257,m418,JACK,Keep firing!
211800,L340873,u6258,m418,KELLY,Watch out!!
211801,L340861,u6257,m418,JACK,You wouldn't?
211802,L340860,u6258,m418,KELLY,He's mooing.
211803,L340845,u6257,m418,JACK,Hector.
211804,L340844,u6258,m418,KELLY,He's floating.  Take it home.
211805,L340843,u6257,m418,JACK,He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
211806,L340842,u6257,m418,JACK,He looks like a giant tea bag.
211807,L340841,u6258,m418,KELLY,He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
211808,L340840,u6257,m418,JACK,It can't work.
211809,L340831,u6257,m418,JACK,We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
211810,L340830,u6258,m418,KELLY,Well...
211811,L340829,u6257,m418,JACK,Are we crazy?
211812,L340800,u6258,m418,KELLY,Good idea.
211813,L340799,u6257,m418,JACK,We might as well pack.
211814,L340798,u6258,m418,KELLY,Okay.
211815,L340797,u6257,m418,JACK,Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
211816,L340771,u6257,m418,JACK,"<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--"
211817,L340770,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Alright, Jack!"
211818,L340769,u6257,m418,JACK,"You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?"
211819,L340724,u6257,m418,JACK,Look.
211820,L340723,u6258,m418,KELLY,What?
211821,L340716,u6257,m418,JACK,<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
211822,L340715,u6258,m418,KELLY,You calm down!
211823,L340714,u6257,m418,JACK,Calm down.
211824,L340713,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
211825,L340712,u6257,m418,JACK,Really--
211826,L340711,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
211827,L340710,u6257,m418,JACK,Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
211828,L340709,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
211829,L340708,u6257,m418,JACK,You're mushing it a little around the--
211830,L340707,u6258,m418,KELLY,I'm not mushing it.
211831,L340706,u6257,m418,JACK,Maybe.  Don't mush it.
211832,L340705,u6258,m418,KELLY,Thing we can lift it?
211833,L340695,u6257,m418,JACK,I heard something.
211834,L340694,u6258,m418,KELLY,What?
211835,L340693,u6257,m418,JACK,Ssssh!
211836,L340692,u6258,m418,KELLY,I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
211837,L340686,u6257,m418,JACK,"We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to..."
211838,L340685,u6258,m418,KELLY,We seem to say goodnight a lot.
211839,L340684,u6257,m418,JACK,Well.  Goodnight.
211840,L340655,u6258,m418,KELLY,Night.
211841,L340654,u6257,m418,JACK,Thanks for the... bandaid.
211842,L340652,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening."
211843,L340651,u6257,m418,JACK,That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
211844,L340649,u6258,m418,KELLY,"What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?"
211845,L340648,u6257,m418,JACK,"You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?"
211846,L340647,u6257,m418,JACK,Thank you.
211847,L340646,u6258,m418,KELLY,Keep it dry.  No swimming.
211848,L340645,u6257,m418,JACK,No thanks.
211849,L340644,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here."
211850,L340643,u6257,m418,JACK,Who taught you be be a nurse?
211851,L340642,u6258,m418,KELLY,Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
211852,L340641,u6257,m418,JACK,<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
211853,L340637,u6258,m418,KELLY,It's okay.
211854,L340636,u6257,m418,JACK,Sorry.
211855,L340635,u6257,m418,JACK,Let's get away from the shore.
211856,L340634,u6258,m418,KELLY,I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
211857,L340633,u6257,m418,JACK,I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
211858,L340632,u6258,m418,KELLY,Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
211859,L340631,u6257,m418,JACK,Like little children.  You okay?
211860,L340618,u6257,m418,JACK,"But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?"
211861,L340617,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans."
211862,L340596,u6257,m418,JACK,Just forget it.
211863,L340595,u6258,m418,KELLY,"A man just died, you're hitting on me with science."
211864,L340594,u6257,m418,JACK,"I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science."
211865,L340593,u6258,m418,KELLY,"You <u>did</u>, you--"
211866,L340592,u6257,m418,JACK,I didn't say it like that.
211867,L340591,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Nice?  Nice would be ""you look pretty,"" nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good."
211868,L340590,u6257,m418,JACK,Forgive me for trying to be nice.
211869,L340589,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist."
211870,L340588,u6257,m418,JACK,"I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good."
211871,L340587,u6258,m418,KELLY,What are you talking about?
211872,L340586,u6257,m418,JACK,"When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie."
211873,L340585,u6258,m418,KELLY,Excuse me?
211874,L340584,u6257,m418,JACK,You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
211875,L340583,u6257,m418,JACK,"I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints."
211876,L340582,u6258,m418,KELLY,Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
211877,L340569,u6258,m418,KELLY,Um... y'know...  Yeah.
211878,L340568,u6257,m418,JACK,<u>Are</u> you okay?
211879,L340567,u6257,m418,JACK,"Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight."
211880,L340566,u6258,m418,KELLY,That's probably good.
211881,L340565,u6257,m418,JACK,No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
211882,L340564,u6258,m418,KELLY,Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
211883,L340563,u6257,m418,JACK,You okay?  Kelly?
211884,L340522,u6258,m418,KELLY,Good luck.
211885,L340521,u6257,m418,JACK,Good.  See ya soon.
211886,L340520,u6258,m418,KELLY,They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
211887,L340500,u6258,m418,KELLY,"In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits."
211888,L340499,u6257,m418,JACK,He thinks they're what?
211889,L340481,u6257,m418,JACK,'Night.
211890,L340480,u6258,m418,KELLY,Good.
211891,L340479,u6257,m418,JACK,Okay.  We're up at six.
211892,L340477,u6257,m418,JACK,I'm sorry but you're...
211893,L340476,u6258,m418,KELLY,That was an awful thing to say to me.
211894,L340473,u6258,m418,KELLY,"I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--"
211895,L340472,u6257,m418,JACK,You flew up here because your boss--
211896,L340471,u6258,m418,KELLY,I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
211897,L340470,u6257,m418,JACK,It's too dangerous for--
211898,L340469,u6258,m418,KELLY,I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
211899,L340468,u6257,m418,JACK,Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
211900,L340467,u6258,m418,KELLY,I beg your pardon?
211901,L340466,u6257,m418,JACK,"Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore."
211902,L340465,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one."
211903,L340464,u6257,m418,JACK,What are you doing?
211904,L340444,u6258,m418,KELLY,I'd be able to see something.
211905,L340443,u6257,m418,JACK,He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
211906,L340441,u6258,m418,KELLY,Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
211907,L340440,u6257,m418,JACK,If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
211908,L340439,u6258,m418,KELLY,Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
211909,L340438,u6257,m418,JACK,Baby crocs?
211910,L340428,u6257,m418,JACK,"Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people."
211911,L340427,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>Something's</u> in that water.
211912,L340426,u6257,m418,JACK,Same thing from Fish And Game.
211913,L340381,u6258,m418,KELLY,There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
211914,L340380,u6257,m418,JACK,In Maine?
211915,L340377,u6258,m418,KELLY,Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
211916,L340376,u6257,m418,JACK,Who?
211917,L340375,u6258,m418,KELLY,If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
211918,L340374,u6257,m418,JACK,What?
211919,L340373,u6258,m418,KELLY,Oh my God.
211920,L340372,u6258,m418,KELLY,"I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks."
211921,L340371,u6257,m418,JACK,"Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--"
211922,L340370,u6258,m418,KELLY,I'm not making it up.
211923,L340366,u6257,m418,JACK,"You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--"
211924,L340365,u6258,m418,KELLY,"So I don't like tents, why--"
211925,L340364,u6257,m418,JACK,"And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>."
211926,L340363,u6258,m418,KELLY,"How would <u>you</u> know, what--"
211927,L340362,u6257,m418,JACK,The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
211928,L340361,u6258,m418,KELLY,I <u>told</u> you.
211929,L340360,u6257,m418,JACK,Why are you here?  Really.
211930,L340359,u6258,m418,KELLY,I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
211931,L340358,u6257,m418,JACK,Never been to Maine before?
211932,L340357,u6258,m418,KELLY,"It really is beautiful, isn't it?"
211933,L340356,u6257,m418,JACK,Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
211934,L340355,u6258,m418,KELLY,And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
211935,L340354,u6257,m418,JACK,Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
211936,L340353,u6258,m418,KELLY,How big do the bears get?
211937,L340312,u6257,m418,JACK,"Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well."
211938,L340311,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in."
211939,L340307,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body."
211940,L340306,u6257,m418,JACK,Did you make anything of the tooth?
211941,L340305,u6258,m418,KELLY,Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
211942,L340304,u6257,m418,JACK,Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
211943,L340303,u6258,m418,KELLY,Kelly Scott.
211944,L340944,u6257,m418,JACK,You too.
211945,L340943,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Thanks for your help.
211946,L340921,u6257,m418,JACK,Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
211947,L340920,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,He's done.  He's dying.
211948,L340888,u6257,m418,JACK,Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
211949,L340887,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I'll take it!
211950,L340886,u6257,m418,JACK,If you get a safe shot...
211951,L340880,u6257,m418,JACK,Where is he?!
211952,L340879,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
211953,L340820,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Other than to eat us?
211954,L340819,u6257,m418,JACK,Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
211955,L340722,u6257,m418,JACK,<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
211956,L340721,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Now I'm gonna puke.
211957,L340691,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,So does he.
211958,L340690,u6257,m418,JACK,They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
211959,L340689,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,We shouldn't even really be doing this.
211960,L340688,u6257,m418,JACK,Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
211961,L340668,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Obviously I was wrong!
211962,L340667,u6257,m418,JACK,You said nobody came in here!
211963,L340616,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?"
211964,L340615,u6257,m418,JACK,"Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished."
211965,L340417,u6257,m418,JACK,They look like they're jumping.
211966,L340416,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
211967,L340415,u6257,m418,JACK,Are they feeding?
211968,L340414,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,White perch.
211969,L340413,u6257,m418,JACK,What's that?
211970,L340334,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I'll call the coroner.
211971,L340333,u6257,m418,JACK,You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
211972,L340332,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Half mile up, there's a clearing."
211973,L340310,u6257,m418,JACK,Let's go.
211974,L340309,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I'm ready when you are.
211975,L340302,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
211976,L340301,u6257,m418,JACK,We set?
211977,L340946,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I guess.
211978,L340945,u6258,m418,KELLY,I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
211979,L340906,u6258,m418,KELLY,Wait.
211980,L340905,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Should I?
211981,L340894,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I don't know.  Back the truck--
211982,L340893,u6258,m418,KELLY,Did you get him?
211983,L340864,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,That it's about to go wrong.
211984,L340863,u6258,m418,KELLY,Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
211985,L340862,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,They're coming right in.
211986,L340857,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,She's worried about the cow now.
211987,L340856,u6258,m418,KELLY,"If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow."
211988,L340727,u6258,m418,KELLY,Look ten feet into the water.
211989,L340726,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,What?
211990,L340725,u6258,m418,KELLY,What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
211991,L340697,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Look.
211992,L340696,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit."
211993,L340625,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,He said he knew Karate!
211994,L340624,u6258,m418,KELLY,Hank!
211995,L340602,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?"
211996,L340601,u6258,m418,KELLY,Are you okay?
211997,L340600,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Yes.
211998,L340599,u6258,m418,KELLY,Hank?
211999,L340557,u6258,m418,KELLY,I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
212000,L340556,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Are you alright?
212001,L340546,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
212002,L340545,u6258,m418,KELLY,What was that?
212003,L340544,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>That</u> was a bust.
212004,L340543,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home."
212005,L340540,u6258,m418,KELLY,Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
212006,L340539,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
212007,L340538,u6258,m418,KELLY,What is this?
212008,L340537,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,You think Jack's handsome?
212009,L340536,u6258,m418,KELLY,Well Hector's a giant cracker.
212010,L340535,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Hector thinks you like him.
212011,L340534,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
212012,L340533,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,You like Jack?
212013,L340532,u6258,m418,KELLY,He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
212014,L340531,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
212015,L340530,u6258,m418,KELLY,"He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped."
212016,L340529,u6258,m418,KELLY,I asked you to be nice to him.
212017,L340528,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
212018,L340504,u6258,m418,KELLY,I'm sorry.
212019,L340503,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies."
212020,L340502,u6258,m418,KELLY,"It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter."
212021,L340501,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
212022,L340496,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,<u>Apologize</u>?
212023,L340495,u6258,m418,KELLY,You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
212024,L340423,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker."
212025,L340422,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,They don't believe her.
212026,L340379,u6258,m418,KELLY,Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
212027,L340378,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,With what?
212028,L340348,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I just let go of it.
212029,L340347,u6258,m418,KELLY,You threw it at me!!
212030,L340346,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Hey!!
212031,L340345,u6258,m418,KELLY,It looks like a branch.
212032,L340344,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I thought I saw...
212033,L340343,u6258,m418,KELLY,What?
212034,L340342,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,What the hell?
212035,L340341,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard ""tents"", will there be toilets?"
212036,L340340,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp."
212037,L340339,u6258,m418,KELLY,We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
212038,L340338,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up."
212039,L340337,u6258,m418,KELLY,Gee.
212040,L340336,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
212041,L340335,u6258,m418,KELLY,What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
212042,L340324,u6258,m418,KELLY,Sheriff.
212043,L340323,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Was he swallowed?
212044,L340322,u6258,m418,KELLY,"We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?"
212045,L340299,u6258,m418,KELLY,It's just that--
212046,L340298,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,You're sort of a rude person.
212047,L340297,u6258,m418,KELLY,"And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?"
212048,L340296,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead."
212049,L340295,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
212050,L340294,u6258,m418,KELLY,Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
212051,L340293,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I got nothing against--
212052,L340292,u6258,m418,KELLY,You have a thing against museums?
212053,L340291,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
212054,L340290,u6258,m418,KELLY,What?
212055,L340289,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,<u>We</u>?
212056,L340288,u6258,m418,KELLY,What kind of backup do we have?
212057,L340287,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Not yet.
212058,L340286,u6258,m418,KELLY,You talk to the married couple?
212059,L340285,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual."
212060,L340284,u6258,m418,KELLY,Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
212061,L340283,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Yes.
212062,L340282,u6258,m418,KELLY,And this is how he came to the boat?
212063,L340281,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Seconds.  Three, four."
212064,L340280,u6258,m418,KELLY,This... how long did this attack go on for?
212065,L340277,u6258,m418,KELLY,I can look at dead things.
212066,L340276,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,This is a little different.
212067,L340275,u6258,m418,KELLY,Well.  At wakes.
212068,L340274,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,"Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?"
212069,L340273,u6258,m418,KELLY,"I'm fine, thank you."
212070,L340272,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,I wouldn't.
212071,L340268,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Um.  No, no.  Let's go."
212072,L340267,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
212073,L340266,u6258,m418,KELLY,Is the dead guy in there?
212074,L340265,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,Yes.
212075,L340264,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
212076,L340263,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
212077,L340262,u6258,m418,KELLY,And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
212078,L340261,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
212079,L340260,u6258,m418,KELLY,Did he say anything?
212080,L340259,u6259,m418,KEOUGH,He just came up screaming.
212081,L340258,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
212082,L340257,u6260,m418,KEVIN,<u>Kelly</u>--
212083,L340256,u6258,m418,KELLY,"I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--"
212084,L340255,u6260,m418,KEVIN,It has nothing to do with--
212085,L340254,u6258,m418,KELLY,"This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--"
212086,L340253,u6260,m418,KEVIN,Well on this one I'd like you to be.
212087,L340252,u6258,m418,KELLY,I'm not even a field person.
212088,L340251,u6260,m418,KEVIN,Part of our research--
212089,L340250,u6258,m418,KELLY,"I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--"
212090,L340249,u6260,m418,KEVIN,Kelly--
212091,L340248,u6258,m418,KELLY,Are you on drugs?
212092,L340247,u6260,m418,KEVIN,I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
212093,L340246,u6258,m418,KELLY,This is what we do?
212094,L340245,u6260,m418,KEVIN,"I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--"
212095,L340244,u6258,m418,KELLY,Sorry?
212096,L340243,u6260,m418,KEVIN,I want you to go there.
212097,L340242,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?"
212098,L340241,u6260,m418,KEVIN,A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
212099,L340240,u6258,m418,KELLY,A tooth?
212100,L340239,u6260,m418,KEVIN,"This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth."
212101,L340238,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out."
212102,L340237,u6260,m418,KEVIN,Hey.
212103,L340208,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Yes, well...  famished."
212104,L340207,u6260,m418,KEVIN,It's ten after nine.
212105,L340206,u6258,m418,KELLY,"<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so..."
212106,L340205,u6260,m418,KEVIN,A jerk.
212107,L340204,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know..."
212108,L340203,u6260,m418,KEVIN,Else.
212109,L340202,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um..."
212110,L340201,u6260,m418,KEVIN,The somebody else part?
212111,L340200,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?"
212112,L340199,u6260,m418,KEVIN,"I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix."
212113,L340198,u6258,m418,KELLY,"I was working for you when ""us"" started, what's--"
212114,L340197,u6260,m418,KEVIN,"You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, ""us""..."
212115,L340196,u6258,m418,KELLY,That's not what you came to say.
212116,L340195,u6258,m418,KELLY,Me too.
212117,L340194,u6260,m418,KEVIN,I had a great time last night. Again.
212118,L340193,u6258,m418,KELLY,Absolutely.
212119,L340192,u6260,m418,KEVIN,Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
212120,L340191,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Kevin, hey."
212121,L340190,u6260,m418,KEVIN,Kelly.
212122,L340234,u6258,m418,KELLY,I really... I should get back.
212123,L340233,u6261,m418,OKUBO,Shitbutt?
212124,L340232,u6258,m418,KELLY,Myra.
212125,L340231,u6261,m418,OKUBO,Liar?
212126,L340230,u6258,m418,KELLY,No.
212127,L340229,u6261,m418,OKUBO,Backstabber?
212128,L340228,u6258,m418,KELLY,"I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know..."
212129,L340227,u6261,m418,OKUBO,Kelly--
212130,L340226,u6258,m418,KELLY,"You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words."
212131,L340225,u6261,m418,OKUBO,"It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say..."
212132,L340224,u6258,m418,KELLY,You and Kevin.
212133,L340223,u6261,m418,OKUBO,"It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and..."
212134,L340222,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>You</u>?
212135,L340221,u6261,m418,OKUBO,"It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--"
212136,L340220,u6258,m418,KELLY,<u>You</u>?
212137,L340219,u6261,m418,OKUBO,Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
212138,L340218,u6258,m418,KELLY,"Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?"
212139,L340217,u6261,m418,OKUBO,Kevin told me you were upset.
212140,L340216,u6258,m418,KELLY,"I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me."
212141,L340215,u6261,m418,OKUBO,Wild guess.
212142,L340214,u6258,m418,KELLY,Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
212143,L340213,u6261,m418,OKUBO,I <u>tapped</u> you.
212144,L340212,u6258,m418,KELLY,"What do you expect, mugging me from behind?"
212145,L342374,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Agent Mapp! Thank you!
212146,L342373,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,Agent Starling! Telephone!
212147,L342259,u6266,m419,CLARICE,He knew her...!
212148,L342258,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,"Hot damn, Clarice."
212149,L342257,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"""- every day."""
212150,L342255,u6266,m419,CLARICE,But why? He didn't weight the others.
212151,L342254,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
212152,L342253,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?"
212153,L342252,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
212154,L342251,u6266,m419,CLARICE,What girl?
212155,L342250,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,"Well, except for the one girl."
212156,L342249,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order."
212157,L342248,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,"Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?"
212158,L342247,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"""Desperately random."" What does he mean?"
212159,L342244,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"He's here, Ardelia."
212160,L342243,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,Lecter said a lot of things.
212161,L342242,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages..."
212162,L342241,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
212163,L342240,u6266,m419,CLARICE,It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
212164,L342239,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,Why not?
212165,L342238,u6266,m419,CLARICE,No. He won't come after me.
212166,L341927,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
212167,L341926,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,Why does she keep repeating the name?
212168,L341925,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Boy, is that smart..."

212175,L341630,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,I love it when you talk dirty.
212176,L341629,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Never cock. Just squeeze.
212177,L341628,u6262,m419,ARDELIA,"Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?"
212178,L341838,u6263,m419,BRIGHAM,"Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot."
212179,L341837,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I will... I promise.
212180,L341836,u6263,m419,BRIGHAM,"Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises."
212181,L341834,u6263,m419,BRIGHAM,"He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never."
212182,L341833,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Sometimes.
212183,L341832,u6263,m419,BRIGHAM,"Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient..."
212184,L341831,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries."
212185,L341830,u6263,m419,BRIGHAM,"Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?"
212186,L341829,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Where?
212187,L341828,u6263,m419,BRIGHAM,"Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford."
212188,L342370,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
212189,L342369,u6264,m419,CATHERINE,"NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU"
212190,L342368,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -"
212191,L342367,u6264,m419,CATHERINE,I don't know! Get me out!!
212192,L342366,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
212193,L342365,u6264,m419,CATHERINE,Get me out!
212194,L342364,u6266,m419,CLARICE,You're all right! Where is he?
212195,L342363,u6264,m419,CATHERINE,"Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!"
212196,L342362,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"FBI, Catherine, you're safe."
212197,L341974,u6265,m419,CHILTON,"He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice."
212198,L341973,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case."
212199,L341972,u6265,m419,CHILTON,"What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!"
212200,L341671,u6266,m419,CLARICE,But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
212201,L341670,u6265,m419,CHILTON,"You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time."
212202,L341669,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
212203,L341667,u6265,m419,CHILTON,"I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her..."
212204,L341666,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I understand.
212205,L341665,u6265,m419,CHILTON,"Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?"
212206,L341664,u6265,m419,CHILTON,Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
212207,L341663,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school."
212208,L341662,u6265,m419,CHILTON,"A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his ""taste"" - so to speak."
212209,L341661,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?"
212210,L341660,u6265,m419,CHILTON,"Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you."
212211,L341659,u6265,m419,CHILTON,"I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy."
212212,L341658,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon."
212213,L342263,u6270,m419,KRENDLER,"The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -"
212214,L342262,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!"
212215,L342261,u6270,m419,KRENDLER,Starling -
212216,L342260,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -"
212217,L342122,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
212218,L342121,u6270,m419,KRENDLER,"Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?"
212219,L342120,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Sir, doesn't this ""William Rubin"" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?"
212220,L342119,u6270,m419,KRENDLER,"He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer."
212221,L342118,u6270,m419,KRENDLER,Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
212222,L342117,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -"
212223,L342116,u6270,m419,KRENDLER,"Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes."
212224,L342115,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
212225,L342114,u6270,m419,KRENDLER,"Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it."
212226,L342113,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -"
212227,L342112,u6270,m419,KRENDLER,"You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico."
212228,L341776,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
212229,L341775,u6272,m419,MR. YOW,"Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling."
212230,L341774,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
212231,L341773,u6272,m419,MR. YOW,Oh.
212232,L341772,u6266,m419,CLARICE,That wasn't me.
212233,L341771,u6272,m419,MR. YOW,"You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?"
212234,L341770,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Okay, Mr. Yow..."
212235,L341769,u6272,m419,MR. YOW,"Okay, Miss Starling?"
212236,L341768,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Good idea.
212237,L341767,u6272,m419,MR. YOW,Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
212238,L341766,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?"
212239,L341761,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it."
212240,L341760,u6272,m419,MR. YOW,"Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter..."
212241,L342352,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
212242,L342351,u6271,m419,MR. GUMB,"Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago."
212243,L342350,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?"
212244,L342349,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I think we may be, yes."
212245,L342348,u6271,m419,MR. GUMB,"Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?"
212246,L342345,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Thanks.
212247,L342344,u6271,m419,MR. GUMB,"Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?"
212248,L342343,u6271,m419,MR. GUMB,"No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure..."
212249,L342342,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?"
212250,L342341,u6271,m419,MR. GUMB,Jack Gordon.
212251,L342340,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?"
212252,L342339,u6271,m419,MR. GUMB,"Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?"
212253,L342338,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?"
212254,L342318,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Yes sir. Thank you, sir..."
212255,L342317,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me."
212256,L342316,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Yes sir... I'll do my best.
212257,L342315,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted."
212258,L342314,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
212259,L342313,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was ""John Grant."" Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other."
212260,L342312,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Sewing...
212261,L342311,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade..."
212262,L342310,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is ""Jamie Gumb,"" AKA ""John Grant."" Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name."
212263,L342309,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Sir, that's great news. But how -"
212264,L342307,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Where?
212265,L342306,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now."
212266,L342305,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -"
212267,L342304,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,Starling -
212268,L342303,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"He's making himself a ""woman suit,"" Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -"
212269,L342280,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it..."
212270,L342279,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
212271,L342278,u6266,m419,CLARICE,But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
212272,L342277,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now."
212273,L342276,u6266,m419,CLARICE,But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
212274,L342275,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals."
212275,L342274,u6266,m419,CLARICE,You do until six p.m.
212276,L342273,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
212277,L342272,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere."
212278,L342076,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
212279,L342075,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
212280,L342074,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours."
212281,L342073,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
212282,L342072,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip."
212283,L342071,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before."
212284,L342070,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home."
212285,L342069,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me."
212286,L342068,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?"
212287,L342067,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,Let's get some coffee and talk.
212288,L342066,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone."
212289,L341969,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
212290,L341968,u6266,m419,CLARICE,You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
212291,L341967,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
212292,L341966,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?"
212293,L341965,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,What would it take?
212294,L341964,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal."
212295,L341963,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all."
212296,L341962,u6266,m419,CLARICE,But if he knew we have so little time -
212297,L341961,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun."
212298,L341960,u6266,m419,CLARICE,He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
212299,L341959,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to."
212300,L341908,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum."
212301,L341907,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,You seem pretty sure of that.
212302,L341906,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
212303,L341905,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -"
212304,L341904,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?"
212305,L341903,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit."
212306,L341902,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,Point taken.
212307,L341901,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters."
212308,L341900,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there."
212309,L341897,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,They weren't there. Get close-ups.
212310,L341896,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
212311,L341880,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me..."
212312,L341879,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"What do you see, Starling?"
212313,L341860,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford."
212314,L341859,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,Are you finished?
212315,L341858,u6266,m419,CLARICE,You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
212316,L341857,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
212317,L341856,u6266,m419,CLARICE,You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
212318,L341855,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Okay, Starling. Let's have it."
212319,L341854,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Like I have a ""knack"" for Dr. Lecter?"
212320,L341853,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
212321,L341852,u6266,m419,CLARICE,He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
212322,L341851,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,Why not?
212323,L341850,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do."
212324,L341849,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,Why?
212325,L341848,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment."
212326,L341847,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see."
212327,L341846,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming..."
212328,L341845,u6266,m419,CLARICE,There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
212329,L341844,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies."
212330,L341755,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on."
212331,L341754,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it."
212332,L341753,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?"
212333,L341752,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Murdered...? How?
212334,L341751,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,Miggs has been murdered.
212335,L341750,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me."
212336,L341749,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that."
212337,L341748,u6266,m419,CLARICE,To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
212338,L341747,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?"
212339,L341746,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -"
212340,L341745,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,Well? Why aren't you there right now?
212341,L341744,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But ""Split City"" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice."
212342,L341743,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"He mentioned a name, at the very end. ""Mofet..."" Any followup on her?"
212343,L341742,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?"
212344,L341741,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Every word, Starling? Every gesture?"
212345,L341740,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"It's all there, sir, practically verbatim."
212346,L341739,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
212347,L341652,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"And what is that, sir?"
212348,L341651,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is."
212349,L341650,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Yes sir.
212350,L341649,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?"
212351,L341647,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now."
212352,L341646,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?"
212353,L341644,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
212354,L341643,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Who's the subject?
212355,L341642,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum."
212356,L341641,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Not yet.
212357,L341640,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?"
212358,L341639,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling."
212359,L341638,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
212360,L341637,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
212361,L341636,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Good morning, Mr. Crawford."
212362,L341635,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Starling, Clarice M., good morning."
212363,L341956,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Dr. Lecter...
212364,L341955,u6273,m419,PILCHER,"They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs."
212365,L341954,u6266,m419,CLARICE,And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
212366,L341948,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Not lately. But maybe someday.
212367,L341947,u6273,m419,PILCHER,Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
212368,L341946,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher."
212369,L341945,u6273,m419,PILCHER,"What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?"
212370,L342335,u6276,m419,STACY,"Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy..."
212371,L342334,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Sometimes you do.
212372,L342333,u6276,m419,STACY,"You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?"
212373,L342332,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I think so.
212374,L342331,u6276,m419,STACY,"Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?"
212375,L342330,u6276,m419,STACY,"She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there."
212376,L342329,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
212377,L342328,u6276,m419,STACY,"Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle."
212378,L342327,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Did you ever work with her?
212379,L342326,u6276,m419,STACY,"No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie."
212380,L342325,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?"
212381,L342324,u6276,m419,STACY,"They said she was just rags, like somebody -"
212382,L342387,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit."
212383,L342386,u6266,m419,CLARICE,You know I can't make that promise.
212384,L342385,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy."
212385,L342384,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Dr. Lecter -
212386,L342383,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end."
212387,L342378,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?"
212388,L342377,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Starling.
212389,L342189,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
212390,L342188,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Yes. I'll tell you.
212391,L342187,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
212392,L342184,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
212393,L342183,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter."
212394,L342182,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Thank you, Clarice."
212395,L342181,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
212396,L342180,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?"
212397,L342179,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Yes...
212398,L342178,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?"
212399,L342177,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
212400,L342176,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
212401,L342175,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
212402,L342174,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Where were you going?
212403,L342173,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could..."
212404,L342172,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,But you could. You did.
212405,L342171,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run..."
212406,L342170,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,So you ran away...
212407,L342169,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Yes...! They were screaming.
212408,L342168,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
212409,L342164,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
212410,L342163,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,What did you do?
212411,L342160,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,What was it?
212412,L342159,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I heard a strange sound...
212413,L342158,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
212414,L342157,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Early. Still dark.
212415,L342156,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Not ""just,"" Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?"
212416,L342155,u6266,m419,CLARICE,And - one morning I just - ran away...
212417,L342154,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?"
212418,L342153,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Later, listen, I'll -"
212419,L342152,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have."
212420,L342151,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -"
212421,L342150,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?"
212422,L342149,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"All right, then tell me how -"
212423,L342148,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?"
212424,L342147,u6266,m419,CLARICE,No. We just -
212425,L342146,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer."
212426,L342145,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-"
212427,L342144,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?"
212428,L342143,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,No! That's incidental.
212429,L342142,u6266,m419,CLARICE,He kills w-
212430,L342141,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?"
212431,L342140,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Then tell me how.
212432,L342139,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is."
212433,L342138,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
212434,L342137,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
212435,L342136,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this ""William Rubin"", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?"
212436,L342134,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
212437,L342133,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
212438,L342132,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
212439,L342027,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Yes, Doctor. Please."
212440,L342026,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?"
212441,L342025,u6266,m419,CLARICE,How would he test?
212442,L342024,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual."
212443,L342023,u6266,m419,CLARICE,On what basis would they reject him?
212444,L342022,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected."
212445,L342021,u6266,m419,CLARICE,You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
212446,L342020,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect."
212447,L342019,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor."
212448,L342018,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Did he try to?
212449,L342017,u6266,m419,CLARICE,No.
212450,L342016,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?"
212451,L342015,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I - ran away...
212452,L342014,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Why so briefly?
212453,L342013,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Two months.
212454,L342012,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,How long did you live there?
212455,L342011,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Horses - and sheep...
212456,L342010,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,A cattle ranch?
212457,L342009,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
212458,L342008,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice."
212459,L342007,u6266,m419,CLARICE,No. Tell me why.
212460,L342006,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
212461,L342005,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive."
212462,L342004,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one..."
212463,L342003,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Quid pro quo, Doctor."
212464,L342002,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life."
212465,L342001,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old."
212466,L342000,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Killed outright?
212467,L341999,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him."
212468,L341998,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know."
212469,L341997,u6266,m419,CLARICE,The death of my father.
212470,L341996,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
212471,L341995,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Go, Doctor."
212472,L341994,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be ""turns"" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock..."
212473,L341993,u6266,m419,CLARICE,That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
212474,L341992,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"""Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center."" Sounds charming."
212475,L341988,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me."
212476,L341987,u6266,m419,CLARICE,A moth... How did you predict that?
212477,L341986,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Was it a butterfly?
212478,L341985,u6266,m419,CLARICE,She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
212479,L341984,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Mmm. And what else...?
212480,L341983,u6266,m419,CLARICE,They all were.
212481,L341982,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Big through the hips. Roomy.
212482,L341981,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Yes.
212483,L341980,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?"
212484,L341979,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"By the book, he's a sadist."
212485,L341978,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his ""next-to-latest""?"
212486,L341977,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us."
212487,L341810,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible."
212488,L341809,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet."
212489,L341808,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Who killed your patient?
212490,L341807,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him."
212491,L341806,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?"
212492,L341805,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments."
212493,L341804,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly."
212494,L341803,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I don't know. Is it?
212495,L341802,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?"
212496,L341801,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask."
212497,L341800,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?"
212498,L341799,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I never thought about it.
212499,L341798,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too."
212500,L341797,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
212501,L341796,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?"
212502,L341795,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Because you weren't wasting my time.
212503,L341794,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Ahhh... Why?
212504,L341793,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated."
212505,L341792,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?"
212506,L341791,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
212507,L341790,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere."
212508,L341789,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"If you didn't kill him, then who did?"
212509,L341788,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under ""Missing Person"" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true."
212510,L341787,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Why don't you tell me about ""Miss Mofet?"" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?"
212511,L341786,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
212512,L341785,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Why? Do you know something about him?
212513,L341784,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
212514,L341783,u6266,m419,CLARICE,How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
212515,L341782,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Your bleeding has stopped.
212516,L341732,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?"
212517,L341731,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"What's that, Dr. Lecter?"
212518,L341730,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling."
212519,L341729,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Then please - do this test for me.
212520,L341728,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
212521,L341725,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling."
212522,L341724,u6266,m419,CLARICE,And the questionnaire...?
212523,L341723,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day."
212524,L341722,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Reasonably so. Yes.
212525,L341721,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"You're a tough one, aren't you?"
212526,L341720,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to."
212527,L341718,u6266,m419,CLARICE,No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
212528,L341717,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?"
212529,L341715,u6266,m419,CLARICE,No. You ate yours.
212530,L341714,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,I didn't.
212531,L341713,u6266,m419,CLARICE,It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
212532,L341712,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom."
212533,L341711,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
212534,L341710,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
212535,L341709,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -"
212536,L341708,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,All flayed...?
212537,L341707,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Five... so far.
212538,L341706,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"How many women has he used, our Bill?"
212539,L341705,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"No, I came because we need -"
212540,L341704,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?"
212541,L341703,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't."
212542,L341702,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring."
212543,L341701,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -"
212544,L341700,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view."
212545,L341699,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"All that detail, just from memory...?"
212546,L341698,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?"
212547,L341697,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Did you do those drawings, Doctor?"
212548,L341696,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,I have no doubt of it.
212549,L341695,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Maybe they'll catch up.
212550,L341694,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,It's much better than your shoes.
212551,L341693,u6266,m419,CLARICE,Yes.
212552,L341692,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?"
212553,L341691,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"He said - ""I can smell your cunt."""
212554,L341690,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  ""Multiple Miggs,"" in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?"
212555,L341689,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please."
212556,L341688,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?"
212557,L341687,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
212558,L341686,u6266,m419,CLARICE,I'm - still in training at the Academy.
212559,L341685,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?"
212560,L341683,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,May I see your credentials?
212561,L341682,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"I am, yes."
212562,L341681,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"""We"" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect."
212563,L341680,u6266,m419,CLARICE,"Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire."
212564,L342061,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind."
212565,L342060,u6268,m419,DR. DANIELSON,It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
212566,L342059,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks."
212567,L342058,u6268,m419,DR. DANIELSON,"I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?"
212568,L342057,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated."
212569,L342054,u6268,m419,DR. DANIELSON,"That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture."
212570,L342053,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin."
212571,L342052,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
212572,L342051,u6268,m419,DR. DANIELSON,"Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will."
212573,L342050,u6267,m419,CRAWFORD,"Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away."
212574,L342049,u6268,m419,DR. DANIELSON,"I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem."
212575,L342101,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit."
212576,L342100,u6275,m419,SEN. MARTIN,"Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind."
212577,L342099,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The ""collar,"" I think they say."
212578,L342098,u6275,m419,SEN. MARTIN,Let's go with it.
212579,L342097,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know."
212580,L342096,u6275,m419,SEN. MARTIN,Yes... I did.
212581,L342094,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,Did you breast-feed her?
212582,L342093,u6275,m419,SEN. MARTIN,What...?
212583,L342089,u6275,m419,SEN. MARTIN,You have my word. Paul?
212584,L342088,u6269,m419,DR. LECTER,"I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over."
212585,L341953,u6273,m419,PILCHER,"The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?"
212586,L341952,u6274,m419,RODEN,Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
212587,L341943,u6273,m419,PILCHER,Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
212588,L341942,u6274,m419,RODEN,"I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?"
212589,L341941,u6273,m419,PILCHER,"Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin."
212590,L341938,u6273,m419,PILCHER,Officer Starling. Welcome back.
212591,L341937,u6274,m419,RODEN,Of course it counts. How do you play?
212592,L341934,u6273,m419,PILCHER,No fair! You lured him with produce.
212593,L341933,u6274,m419,RODEN,"Time, Pilch! My move."
212594,L342603,u6277,m420,ALICE,"Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall."
212595,L342602,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice..."
212596,L342504,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Absolutely.
212597,L342503,u6277,m420,ALICE,Can we rest soon?
212598,L342502,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Are you alright?
212599,L342492,u6277,m420,ALICE,"I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!"
212600,L342491,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Yes, miss."
212601,L342490,u6277,m420,ALICE,We leave in the morning?!
212602,L342489,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"My God, you've grown up."
212603,L342949,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee."
212604,L342948,u6278,m420,CORA,Where will we go?
212605,L342944,u6278,m420,CORA,I have nothing to go back for.
212606,L342943,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Will you go back to England?
212607,L342939,u6278,m420,CORA,Alice?
212608,L342938,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,And my compliments to you...
212609,L342897,u6278,m420,CORA,...never doubt what you are doing.
212610,L342896,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes..."
212611,L342892,u6278,m420,CORA,Yes. I want you to go.
212612,L342891,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?"
212613,L342884,u6278,m420,CORA,Our father? Did you see my father?
212614,L342883,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Maybe...
212615,L342882,u6278,m420,CORA,Are we safe?
212616,L342782,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
212617,L342781,u6278,m420,CORA,What is it?
212618,L342778,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Do not.  Promise me.
212619,L342777,u6278,m420,CORA,No. I will find you.
212620,L342776,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English."
212621,L342775,u6278,m420,CORA,What would you have me do?
212622,L342774,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Because what I am interested in is right here...
212623,L342773,u6278,m420,CORA,They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
212624,L342683,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Why, I am looking at you, Miss."
212625,L342682,u6278,m420,CORA,"What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?"
212626,L342680,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Miss.  May I?
212627,L342679,u6278,m420,CORA,Mr Poe?
212628,L342599,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
212629,L342598,u6278,m420,CORA,Much further?
212630,L342597,u6278,m420,CORA,On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
212631,L342596,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Sorry to disappoint you...
212632,L342595,u6278,m420,CORA,"You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London..."
212633,L342593,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria."
212634,L342592,u6278,m420,CORA,In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
212635,L342591,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
212636,L342590,u6278,m420,CORA,And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
212637,L342589,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
212638,L342588,u6278,m420,CORA,How did you learn English?
212639,L342587,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,I do not remember them. I was one or two.
212640,L342586,u6278,m420,CORA,I'm sorry.
212641,L342585,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
212642,L342583,u6278,m420,CORA,Thank you so much.
212643,L342582,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance..."
212644,L342581,u6278,m420,CORA,"""We're a breed apart and we make no sense""...?"
212645,L342580,u6278,m420,CORA,Why did they turn back?
212646,L342579,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,The Ottawa are gone.
212647,L342578,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Yes. And ""do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."""
212648,L342577,u6278,m420,CORA,What?!
212649,L342576,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Yes. He said... ""do not try to make them understand you."""
212650,L342575,u6278,m420,CORA,He did?
212651,L342574,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
212652,L342573,u6278,m420,CORA,"Your ""father""?"
212653,L342572,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Well that is to be expected. My father...
212654,L342571,u6278,m420,CORA,You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
212655,L342570,u6278,m420,CORA,You knew them.
212656,L342569,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing..."
212657,L342568,u6278,m420,CORA,Why didn't you bury those people?
212658,L342566,u6278,m420,CORA,"I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference."
212659,L342565,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Let us go, miss."
212660,L342564,u6278,m420,CORA,"Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!"
212661,L342771,u6278,m420,CORA,"Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!"
212662,L342770,u6285,m420,MUNRO,You do not know what you are saying!
212663,L342769,u6278,m420,CORA,"""Justice""?  If that's ""justice""..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people."
212664,L342768,u6285,m420,MUNRO,But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
212665,L342760,u6278,m420,CORA,"He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something."
212666,L342759,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children."
212667,L342628,u6285,m420,MUNRO,I sent three men to Webb!
212668,L342627,u6278,m420,CORA,There was no letter.
212669,L342626,u6285,m420,MUNRO,What?
212670,L342625,u6278,m420,CORA,There was none!
212671,L342624,u6285,m420,MUNRO,My letter...
212672,L342623,u6278,m420,CORA,When? How?
212673,L342622,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
212674,L342937,u6278,m420,CORA,What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
212675,L342936,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out."
212676,L342890,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,What the bloody hell plan is this?
212677,L342889,u6278,m420,CORA,Yes. Go ahead.
212678,L342766,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
212679,L342765,u6278,m420,CORA,"They do not live their lives ""by your leave.""  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way."
212680,L342762,u6278,m420,CORA,"You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said..."
212681,L342761,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
212682,L342719,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
212683,L342718,u6278,m420,CORA,"beyond the periphery of men, staring at him."
212684,L342710,u6278,m420,CORA,"I am sorry, Duncan..."
212685,L342709,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,I see...
212686,L342707,u6278,m420,CORA,"Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment."
212687,L342706,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts..."
212688,L342630,u6278,m420,CORA,He delivered no such message.
212689,L342629,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,One called Magua arrived.
212690,L342494,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,It can be dangerous...
212691,L342493,u6278,m420,CORA,"My God, Alice."
212692,L342487,u6278,m420,CORA,"Yes. Yes, I will."
212693,L342486,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Will you consider that?
212694,L342485,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?"
212695,L342484,u6278,m420,CORA,"Cousin Eugenie, my father, but..."
212696,L342483,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"""Some""?"
212697,L342482,u6278,m420,CORA,Some say that's the way of it.
212698,L342481,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?"
212699,L342480,u6278,m420,CORA,"Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?"
212700,L342478,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Aversion?  No... ""Hatred""... ""Loathing""..."
212701,L342477,u6278,m420,CORA,You still have an aversion to the water?
212702,L342476,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,And by sea!
212703,L342475,u6278,m420,CORA,I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
212704,L342881,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,: Only one or two loads.
212705,L342880,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Any powder?
212706,L342879,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
212707,L342878,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,And if we're unlucky?
212708,L342877,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
212709,L342876,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Then what?
212710,L342875,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls."
212711,L342874,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,I don't understand!
212712,L342873,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,We don't.
212713,L342872,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Where do we go from here?
212714,L342869,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?"
212715,L342868,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Head for... for the white water.
212716,L342865,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
212717,L342864,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,How long?
212718,L342735,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
212719,L342734,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
212720,L342733,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,That is the truth!
212721,L342732,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,That is sedition! Treason!
212722,L342731,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!"
212723,L342558,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Excuse me...
212724,L342557,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Ottawa!
212725,L342556,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Who were these people?
212726,L342552,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Do not let gratitude get in the way...
212727,L342551,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
212728,L342548,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs.
212729,L342547,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
212730,L342546,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"I ain't your ""scout"". And I am in no damn militia."
212731,L342545,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
212732,L342544,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
212733,L342543,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Fort Edward, then?"
212734,L342542,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,No.
212735,L342541,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
212736,L342540,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Came across the war party, tracked 'em."
212737,L342539,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
212738,L342538,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
212739,L342537,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
212740,L342536,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Dark haired...
212741,L342535,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,What?!
212742,L342534,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
212743,L342533,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
212744,L342532,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
212745,L342531,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"How far is it, scout?"
212746,L342527,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,...Fort William Henry.
212747,L342526,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,We were headed...
212748,L342525,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
212749,L342438,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
212750,L342437,u6282,m420,LIEUTENANT,"You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?"
212751,L342436,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
212752,L342433,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?"
212753,L342432,u6282,m420,LIEUTENANT,Will you men help us stop the French?
212754,L342431,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands..."
212755,L342430,u6282,m420,LIEUTENANT,Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
212756,L342429,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
212757,L342428,u6282,m420,LIEUTENANT,What did you say?
212758,L342427,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Your enemy...
212759,L342426,u6282,m420,LIEUTENANT,It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
212760,L342749,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop.  Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.  Good luck, Jack."
212761,L342748,u6281,m420,JACK,That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
212762,L342747,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Got a reason to stay.
212763,L342746,u6281,m420,JACK,You're not coming with us?
212764,L342745,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
212765,L342742,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers..."
212766,L342741,u6281,m420,JACK,"I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour."
212767,L342409,u6281,m420,JACK,We'll see in the morning...
212768,L342408,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
212769,L342407,u6281,m420,JACK,A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
212770,L342406,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?"
212771,L342404,u6281,m420,JACK,Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
212772,L342403,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
212773,L342928,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth."
212774,L342927,u6283,m420,MAGUA,"The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way."
212775,L342926,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
212776,L342925,u6283,m420,MAGUA,"No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites."
212777,L342924,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
212778,L342922,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron."
212779,L342921,u6283,m420,MAGUA,"Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger."
212780,L342920,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
212781,L342725,u6285,m420,MUNRO,You forget yourself!
212782,L342724,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!"
212783,L342723,u6285,m420,MUNRO,I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
212784,L342717,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"What did you see, Major?"
212785,L342716,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
212786,L342657,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"That's all, sir."
212787,L342656,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"Many men here, their homes are in the path."
212788,L342654,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
212789,L342653,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"Yes, Mr. Poe? So?"
212790,L342647,u6285,m420,MUNRO,...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
212791,L342646,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,"A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb."
212792,L342637,u6285,m420,MUNRO,What else?
212793,L342636,u6279,m420,HAWKEYE,Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
212794,L342469,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"By your leave, sir."
212795,L342468,u6288,m420,WEBB,The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
212796,L342467,u6288,m420,WEBB,"Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The ""Scotsman"" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you."
212797,L342466,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
212798,L342465,u6288,m420,WEBB,You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
212799,L342464,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir."
212800,L342463,u6288,m420,WEBB,"I know.  One has to give Americans ""reasons"" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here."
212801,L342462,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"The Crown ""negotiating"" the terms of service?"
212802,L342461,u6288,m420,WEBB,And what is that?
212803,L342460,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
212804,L342811,u6285,m420,MUNRO,The decision is final.
212805,L342810,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Sir!
212806,L342809,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
212807,L342808,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
212808,L342807,u6285,m420,MUNRO,I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
212809,L342796,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis."
212810,L342795,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end."
212811,L342764,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a ""by your leave."""
212812,L342763,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
212813,L342659,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
212814,L342658,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Things were done. Nobody was spared...
212815,L342651,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message."
212816,L342650,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Yes, sir."
212817,L342649,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Webb's at Edward?
212818,L342648,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
212819,L342645,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days."
212820,L342644,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?"
212821,L342643,u6285,m420,MUNRO,What a place for them...
212822,L342635,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Thank you. How can I reward you?
212823,L342634,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
212824,L342633,u6285,m420,MUNRO,What happened to you?
212825,L342632,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
212826,L342631,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
212827,L342846,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Fire!
212828,L342845,u6287,m420,SERGEANT MAJOR,Right - about face! March! First rank present!
212829,L342843,u6287,m420,SERGEANT MAJOR,Yes sir!
212830,L342842,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!"
212831,L342701,u6287,m420,SERGEANT MAJOR,Atten-hut!
212832,L342700,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men."
212833,L342699,u6287,m420,SERGEANT MAJOR,Sir!
212834,L342698,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Sergeant Major!
212835,L342696,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Fire!!!
212836,L342695,u6287,m420,SERGEANT MAJOR,Shoulder arms!  Present!
212837,L342694,u6287,m420,SERGEANT MAJOR,Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
212838,L342693,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Advance, Sergeant Major!"
212839,L342692,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Fire!!!
212840,L342691,u6287,m420,SERGEANT MAJOR,First rank! Second rank! Present arms!
212841,L342690,u6287,m420,SERGEANT MAJOR,"Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready!"
212842,L342689,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Sergeant! Form three ranks!
212843,L342913,u6283,m420,MAGUA,Heart. Give Magua new heart.
212844,L342912,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,What is enough?
212845,L342910,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,The King? The King has mountains of gold!
212846,L342909,u6283,m420,MAGUA,How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
212847,L342908,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Yes.
212848,L342907,u6283,m420,MAGUA,For Munro children?
212849,L342906,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Gold could be arranged.
212850,L342905,u6283,m420,MAGUA,"Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen."
212851,L342904,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Yes.
212852,L342903,u6283,m420,MAGUA,Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
212853,L342902,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Yes.
212854,L342901,u6283,m420,MAGUA,Wampum?
212855,L342900,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"Three, four oxen... much wampum."
212856,L342899,u6283,m420,MAGUA,Gifts?
212857,L342898,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
212858,L342511,u6283,m420,MAGUA,"Magua say: ""Yes. Good idea."""
212859,L342510,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,Excuse me. What did you say?
212860,L342509,u6283,m420,MAGUA,"""Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."""
212861,L342508,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,"No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?"
212862,L342507,u6283,m420,MAGUA,I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
212863,L342506,u6280,m420,HEYWARD,We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
212864,L342730,u6281,m420,JACK,Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
212865,L342729,u6285,m420,MUNRO,This interview's over! The militia stays!
212866,L342728,u6281,m420,JACK,Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
212867,L342727,u6285,m420,MUNRO,British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
212868,L342726,u6281,m420,JACK,We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
212869,L342715,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you."
212870,L342714,u6281,m420,JACK,"Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence."
212871,L342713,u6285,m420,MUNRO,I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
212872,L342836,u6283,m420,MAGUA,"Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can."
212873,L342835,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,"Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France..."
212874,L342834,u6283,m420,MAGUA,Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
212875,L342833,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,My son Magua's pain is my pain.
212876,L342832,u6283,m420,MAGUA,Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
212877,L342831,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
212878,L342830,u6283,m420,MAGUA,And this?
212879,L342829,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
212880,L342827,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,"That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well."
212881,L342826,u6283,m420,MAGUA,"Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation."
212882,L342825,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
212883,L342824,u6283,m420,MAGUA,"Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried."
212884,L342823,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
212885,L342822,u6283,m420,MAGUA,Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
212886,L342821,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,Yes.
212887,L342820,u6283,m420,MAGUA,Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
212888,L342671,u6283,m420,MAGUA,"When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever."
212889,L342670,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,"Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?"
212890,L342813,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,"Granted, Monsieur."
212891,L342812,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon."
212892,L342806,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Allow me to consult with my officers.
212893,L342805,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,Carry them to England to your King with pride.
212894,L342804,u6285,m420,MUNRO,My colors?
212895,L342803,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,Granted.
212896,L342802,u6285,m420,MUNRO,The honors of war?
212897,L342801,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,"They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish."
212898,L342800,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Their arms?
212899,L342799,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,"My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms."
212900,L342798,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Such as...?
212901,L342791,u6285,m420,MUNRO,Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
212902,L342790,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,"Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?"
212903,L342789,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands."
212904,L342788,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,"You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender."
212905,L342787,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason."
212906,L342786,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
212907,L342785,u6285,m420,MUNRO,"And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis."
212908,L342784,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,"Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend."
212909,L342819,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,"Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant."
212910,L342818,u6286,m420,SENTRY,"C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!"
212911,L342817,u6284,m420,MONTCALM,La victoire.

213025,L347422,u6289,m421,BECK,How's astronaut training?
213026,L347421,u6297,m421,WILLIE,After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
213027,L347420,u6289,m421,BECK,That was a loud one wasn't it?

213037,L347239,u6289,m421,BECK,What?
213038,L347238,u6297,m421,WILLIE,You did good...

213275,L352361,u6299,m422,BACON,Apart from those shotguns.
213276,L352360,u6305,m422,EDDY,The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
213277,L352324,u6305,m422,EDDY,Well what?
213278,L352323,u6299,m422,BACON,Well?
213279,L352317,u6299,m422,BACON,"Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice."
213280,L352316,u6305,m422,EDDY,He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.

213283,L352193,u6305,m422,EDDY,"I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights."
213284,L352192,u6299,m422,BACON,I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
213285,L352188,u6299,m422,BACON,"Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden."
213286,L352187,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Bacon, see what we got."
213287,L352184,u6305,m422,EDDY,I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
213288,L352183,u6299,m422,BACON,"Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble."
213289,L352064,u6299,m422,BACON,It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
213290,L352063,u6305,m422,EDDY,Yes?
213291,L351999,u6305,m422,EDDY,"They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?"
213292,L351998,u6299,m422,BACON,I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
213293,L351942,u6305,m422,EDDY,"I'll think of something, don't worry."
213294,L351941,u6299,m422,BACON,"Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe."
213295,L351763,u6299,m422,BACON,"And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know."
213296,L351762,u6305,m422,EDDY,Because it's cheap like a budgie.
213297,L351756,u6305,m422,EDDY,"I still will, if you don't mind."
213298,L351755,u6299,m422,BACON,"Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it."
213299,L351738,u6299,m422,BACON,The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
213300,L351737,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist."
213301,L351710,u6305,m422,EDDY,The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
213302,L351709,u6299,m422,BACON,"Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz."
213303,L351861,u6316,m422,SAMOAN JO,"You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you."
213304,L351860,u6299,m422,BACON,"Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?"
213305,L351859,u6316,m422,SAMOAN JO,It's a Samoan pub.
213306,L351858,u6299,m422,BACON,I thought this was a pub.
213307,L351857,u6316,m422,SAMOAN JO,"You want a pint, go to the pub."
213308,L351856,u6299,m422,BACON,"No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that."
213309,L351855,u6316,m422,SAMOAN JO,"A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail."
213310,L351854,u6299,m422,BACON,What's that?
213311,L352265,u6300,m422,BARRY,"You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?"
213312,L352264,u6302,m422,DEAN,"Yeah, Bazza, what?"
213313,L352263,u6300,m422,BARRY,"Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . ."
213314,L352262,u6302,m422,DEAN,We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
213315,L352261,u6300,m422,BARRY,You fucking well have to get 'em!
213316,L352032,u6300,m422,BARRY,I am not fucking interested.
213317,L352031,u6302,m422,DEAN,They were . . .
213318,L352030,u6300,m422,BARRY,"Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish."
213319,L352029,u6302,m422,DEAN,"Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!"
213320,L352028,u6300,m422,BARRY,There were two old guns there; where are they?
213321,L352027,u6302,m422,DEAN,I don't know what you mean.
213322,L352026,u6300,m422,BARRY,"Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?"
213323,L352025,u6302,m422,DEAN,There are no others.
213324,L352024,u6300,m422,BARRY,Where're the others?
213325,L352023,u6302,m422,DEAN,"Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars."
213326,L351902,u6302,m422,DEAN,You should see what they did to poor Gary.
213327,L351901,u6300,m422,BARRY,You get the guns?
213328,L351900,u6302,m422,DEAN,"I thought you said no staff, Bazza!"
213329,L351831,u6300,m422,BARRY,"If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place."
213330,L351830,u6302,m422,DEAN,"Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?"
213331,L351829,u6300,m422,BARRY,Like antiques.
213332,L351828,u6302,m422,DEAN,Like what?
213333,L351748,u6307,m422,HATCHET,Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
213334,L351747,u6300,m422,BARRY,"Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?"
213335,L351746,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"Good, you can get this under control now."
213336,L351745,u6300,m422,BARRY,"No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control."
213337,L351744,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?"
213338,L351743,u6307,m422,HATCHET,Where did he get a hundred grand?
213339,L351742,u6300,m422,BARRY,"Better than good, he is a fucking liability."
213340,L351741,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"All right, all right, so we can say he is good."
213341,L351837,u6300,m422,BARRY,Fucking Northern monkeys.
213342,L351836,u6306,m422,GARY,I hate these Southern shites.
213343,L351835,u6300,m422,BARRY,"Careful, remember who's giving you this job."
213344,L351834,u6306,m422,GARY,"I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?"
213345,L351833,u6300,m422,BARRY,You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
213346,L351832,u6306,m422,GARY,So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
213347,L351827,u6300,m422,BARRY,"It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there."
213348,L351826,u6306,m422,GARY,"Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us."
213349,L351825,u6300,m422,BARRY,"Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours."
213350,L351824,u6306,m422,GARY,"Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?"
213351,L352381,u6309,m422,JD,"Well, I suggest you speak to him, then."
213352,L352380,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually."
213353,L352379,u6309,m422,JD,Yes?
213354,L352378,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"I think I can help you, as it happens."
213355,L352377,u6309,m422,JD,Can I help?
213356,L352376,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,Nope.
213357,L352375,u6309,m422,JD,"Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?"
213358,L352374,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,JD.
213359,L352308,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"Good job, Chris."
213360,L352307,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there."
213361,L352306,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"They were going to pay, then?"
213362,L352305,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"Yeah, it's all there, to the pound."
213363,L352304,u6307,m422,HATCHET,Have you counted the money?
213364,L352301,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em."
213365,L352300,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
213366,L352195,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"No Harry, you can't."
213367,L352194,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?"
213368,L352297,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John."
213369,L352296,u6311,m422,JOHN O'DRISCOLL,I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
213370,L352295,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"Hello, John. Nice holiday?"
213371,L351792,u6311,m422,JOHN O'DRISCOLL,No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
213372,L351791,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"Son, have a look in his locker."
213373,L351790,u6311,m422,JOHN O'DRISCOLL,"I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there."
213374,L351789,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
213375,L351781,u6311,m422,JOHN O'DRISCOLL,Jesus Christ!
213376,L351780,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,Mind your language in front of my boy.
213377,L352352,u6303,m422,DOG,You had better be careful.
213378,L352351,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive."
213379,L352350,u6303,m422,DOG,What are you doing?
213380,L352349,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"All right, furry muff."
213381,L352348,u6303,m422,DOG,"Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop."
213382,L352347,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
213383,L352346,u6303,m422,DOG,Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
213384,L352345,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"You all right back there, mate?"
213385,L352344,u6303,m422,DOG,"Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?"
213386,L352343,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,Son?
213387,L352387,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"Well, put your seatbelt on then."
213388,L352386,u6312,m422,LITTLE CHRIS,"All right, Dad."
213389,L352385,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?"
213390,L351776,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,Try that one.
213391,L351775,u6312,m422,LITTLE CHRIS,"It's not him, Dad."
213392,L351773,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"Let's have a look, shall we?"
213393,L351772,u6312,m422,LITTLE CHRIS,Just carrying a bag.
213394,L351771,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,Is he on his own?
213395,L351770,u6312,m422,LITTLE CHRIS,About twenty minutes.
213396,L351769,u6301,m422,BIG CHRIS,"How long has he been in there, son?"
213397,L352259,u6313,m422,NICK,"I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again."
213398,L352258,u6302,m422,DEAN,I got the money to pay for 'em.
213399,L352257,u6313,m422,NICK,Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
213400,L352256,u6302,m422,DEAN,"You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back."
213401,L352255,u6313,m422,NICK,What can I do for you?
213402,L352254,u6302,m422,DEAN,Sure is.
213403,L352253,u6313,m422,NICK,"Is that you, Dean?"
213404,L352252,u6302,m422,DEAN,That's no way to answer the phone.
213405,L352251,u6313,m422,NICK,Yeah?
213406,L352312,u6306,m422,GARY,"Furry muff, let's go."
213407,L352311,u6302,m422,DEAN,"Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet."
213408,L352310,u6306,m422,GARY,"This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there."
213409,L352309,u6302,m422,DEAN,We gotta get those guns.
213410,L352270,u6302,m422,DEAN,We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
213411,L352269,u6306,m422,GARY,"Jesus, I have heard about him."
213412,L352268,u6302,m422,DEAN,That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
213413,L352267,u6306,m422,GARY,Who was that?
213414,L351891,u6306,m422,GARY,"It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny."
213415,L351890,u6302,m422,DEAN,"Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?"
213416,L351889,u6306,m422,GARY,"All right, Kenny."
213417,L351888,u6302,m422,DEAN,"OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?"
213418,L352275,u6310,m422,JOHN,"But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em."
213419,L352274,u6303,m422,DOG,We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
213420,L352273,u6310,m422,JOHN,"Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?"
213421,L352272,u6303,m422,DOG,The stupid bastards! Count it!
213422,L352271,u6310,m422,JOHN,"Dog, I have found the cash!"
213423,L352240,u6303,m422,DOG,"In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?"
213424,L352239,u6310,m422,JOHN,"Er well, yes we do."
213425,L352238,u6303,m422,DOG,"So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?"
213426,L352229,u6303,m422,DOG,"It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible."
213427,L352228,u6310,m422,JOHN,What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
213428,L352227,u6303,m422,DOG,I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
213429,L352161,u6303,m422,DOG,How about you? All right?
213430,L352160,u6315,m422,PLANK,"My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?"
213431,L352135,u6303,m422,DOG,"OK, open the gate."
213432,L352134,u6315,m422,PLANK,"Yeah, one of them's out."
213433,L352118,u6303,m422,DOG,Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
213434,L352117,u6315,m422,PLANK,Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
213435,L352114,u6303,m422,DOG,Just give me the keys.
213436,L352113,u6315,m422,PLANK,It must be this one.
213437,L352110,u6315,m422,PLANK,"I didn't touch him, he just passed out."
213438,L352109,u6303,m422,DOG,What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
213439,L352108,u6315,m422,PLANK,"Just hold on, I got the keys."
213440,L352107,u6303,m422,DOG,
213441,L352058,u6303,m422,DOG,"And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?"
213442,L352057,u6315,m422,PLANK,No.
213443,L352056,u6303,m422,DOG,"What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?"
213444,L352055,u6303,m422,DOG,"There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy."
213445,L352054,u6315,m422,PLANK,"There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy."
213446,L351983,u6315,m422,PLANK,Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
213447,L351982,u6303,m422,DOG,Is there no way they can get back to you?
213448,L351981,u6315,m422,PLANK,"I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff."
213449,L351980,u6303,m422,DOG,"What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?"
213450,L351979,u6315,m422,PLANK,There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
213451,L351972,u6315,m422,PLANK,"Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite."
213452,L351971,u6303,m422,DOG,What they like then?
213453,L351970,u6315,m422,PLANK,Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
213454,L351969,u6303,m422,DOG,So do you know these geezers well?
213455,L352140,u6321,m422,WINSTON,Out the back.
213456,L352139,u6303,m422,DOG,And the weed?
213457,L352138,u6321,m422,WINSTON,Out the back.
213458,L352137,u6303,m422,DOG,Where?
213459,L352133,u6303,m422,DOG,Plank?
213460,L352132,u6321,m422,WINSTON,"I mean it, there is only three of us here."
213461,L352131,u6303,m422,DOG,Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
213462,L352130,u6321,m422,WINSTON,There is only three of us here.
213463,L352129,u6303,m422,DOG,"And all your friends, there's a good lad."
213464,L352128,u6321,m422,WINSTON,"All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK."
213465,L352127,u6303,m422,DOG,"Right, his leg's going now."
213466,L352112,u6303,m422,DOG,"Get the sodding gate open now, Plank."
213467,L352111,u6321,m422,WINSTON,"J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked."
213468,L352094,u6303,m422,DOG,What the fuck is going on?
213469,L352093,u6321,m422,WINSTON,"Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do."
213470,L351844,u6304,m422,DOORMAN,"Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one."
213471,L351843,u6305,m422,EDDY,Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
213472,L351842,u6304,m422,DOORMAN,"All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door."
213473,L351841,u6305,m422,EDDY,Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
213474,L351840,u6304,m422,DOORMAN,"Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it."
213475,L351839,u6305,m422,EDDY,Invitations?
213476,L351838,u6304,m422,DOORMAN,Invitations.
213477,L352390,u6305,m422,EDDY,I mean it's fucking empty.
213478,L352389,u6317,m422,SOAP,What do you mean?
213479,L352388,u6305,m422,EDDY,There's nothing in it!
213480,L352370,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge."
213481,L352369,u6317,m422,SOAP,I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
213482,L352354,u6305,m422,EDDY,"I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear."
213483,L352353,u6317,m422,SOAP,"Well, what's going on?"
213484,L352328,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him."
213485,L352327,u6317,m422,SOAP,You what? What are you on about?
213486,L352314,u6305,m422,EDDY,"It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him."
213487,L352313,u6317,m422,SOAP,I hope this is the right move.
213488,L352199,u6305,m422,EDDY,"There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won."
213489,L352198,u6317,m422,SOAP,You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
213490,L352197,u6305,m422,EDDY,"That's it all done, we are off."
213491,L352172,u6305,m422,EDDY,"If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate."
213492,L352171,u6317,m422,SOAP,And look what happened to that.
213493,L352170,u6305,m422,EDDY,Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
213494,L352169,u6317,m422,SOAP,"No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward."
213495,L352077,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?"
213496,L352076,u6317,m422,SOAP,Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
213497,L352009,u6305,m422,EDDY,"No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still"
213498,L352008,u6317,m422,SOAP,Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
213499,L352007,u6305,m422,EDDY,And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
213500,L352006,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and..."
213501,L352005,u6317,m422,SOAP,"Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . ."
213502,L352004,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!"
213503,L352003,u6317,m422,SOAP,"What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?"
213504,L351997,u6305,m422,EDDY,Hit the fuckers.
213505,L351996,u6317,m422,SOAP,"Well, what do you want us to do about it?"
213506,L351726,u6317,m422,SOAP,"Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?"
213507,L351725,u6305,m422,EDDY,Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
213508,L352368,u6318,m422,TOM,"We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?"
213509,L352367,u6305,m422,EDDY,The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
213510,L352341,u6318,m422,TOM,I'll only be a minute.
213511,L352340,u6305,m422,EDDY,Tom?
213512,L352339,u6318,m422,TOM,I'11 meet you in the car.
213513,L352338,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Tom, don't mess around, let's go."
213514,L352336,u6305,m422,EDDY,"This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go."
213515,L352335,u6318,m422,TOM,. . . What?
213516,L352334,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Tom, this is our case."
213517,L352332,u6318,m422,TOM,"What do you mean, me?"
213518,L352331,u6305,m422,EDDY,"You and me, Tom."
213519,L352326,u6305,m422,EDDY,"He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now."
213520,L352325,u6318,m422,TOM,"Well, what did he say?"
213521,L352167,u6305,m422,EDDY,Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
213522,L352166,u6318,m422,TOM,Right as rain.
213523,L352165,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Everything all right out there, Tom?"
213524,L352072,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look."
213525,L352071,u6318,m422,TOM,"I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em."
213526,L351822,u6318,m422,TOM,"Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!"
213527,L351821,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Why, what's up?"
213528,L351820,u6318,m422,TOM,What the hell are you doing here?
213529,L351765,u6305,m422,EDDY,He means they're thieving dogs.
213530,L351764,u6318,m422,TOM,What do you mean?
213531,L351732,u6305,m422,EDDY,"The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him."
213532,L351731,u6318,m422,TOM,You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
213533,L351728,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry."
213534,L351727,u6318,m422,TOM,"Who's this fat man, then?"
213535,L352322,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!"
213536,L352321,u6305,m422,EDDY,I wanted to talk to you about that.
213537,L352320,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"It's pay day, ain't it?"
213538,L352319,u6305,m422,EDDY,"It's Ed, if that's what you mean."
213539,L352318,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"That you, boy?"
213540,L351929,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?"
213541,L351928,u6305,m422,EDDY,Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
213542,L351927,u6307,m422,HATCHET,For half a million?
213543,L351926,u6305,m422,EDDY,I'll see ya.
213544,L351924,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha."
213545,L351923,u6305,m422,EDDY,That's if I want to see you.
213546,L351922,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"No, you need five hundred grand to see me."
213547,L351921,u6305,m422,EDDY,I need two hundred and fifty grand.
213548,L351920,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow."
213549,L351919,u6305,m422,EDDY,I think I would rather just turn them over.
213550,L351918,u6307,m422,HATCHET,I will loan you the money.
213551,L351917,u6305,m422,EDDY,You will what?
213552,L351916,u6307,m422,HATCHET,I will.
213553,L351914,u6307,m422,HATCHET,Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
213554,L351913,u6305,m422,EDDY,"That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred."
213555,L351850,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that."
213556,L351849,u6305,m422,EDDY,"Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father."
213557,L351848,u6307,m422,HATCHET,You must be Eddy. JD's son.
213558,L351730,u6305,m422,EDDY,A hundred grand.
213559,L351729,u6307,m422,HATCHET,You got it all?
213560,L352052,u6309,m422,JD,"And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!"
213561,L352051,u6307,m422,HATCHET,"What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life."
213562,L352050,u6309,m422,JD,"Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it."
213563,L352049,u6307,m422,HATCHET,Do you want me to draw a picture?
213564,L352048,u6309,m422,JD,And?
213565,L352047,u6307,m422,HATCHET,I want your bar.
213566,L352046,u6309,m422,JD,Yes?
213567,L352045,u6307,m422,HATCHET,I like your bar.
213568,L352044,u6309,m422,JD,Go on.
213569,L352105,u6315,m422,PLANK,What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
213570,L352104,u6308,m422,J,"What are you doing, Plank?"
213571,L352103,u6315,m422,PLANK,"I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left."
213572,L352102,u6308,m422,J,"Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days."
213573,L352101,u6315,m422,PLANK,Lives and learns doesn't one.
213574,L352100,u6308,m422,J,"I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank."
213575,L352099,u6315,m422,PLANK,I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
213576,L352088,u6308,m422,J,"Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest."
213577,L352087,u6315,m422,PLANK,I think you'll find it is in your interest.
213578,L352086,u6308,m422,J,"I can't help you, Plank."
213579,L352085,u6315,m422,PLANK,"Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?"
213580,L352084,u6308,m422,J,"Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean."
213581,L352083,u6315,m422,PLANK,"Well, perhaps you can help?"
213582,L352082,u6308,m422,J,"No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment."
213583,L352081,u6315,m422,PLANK,"All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?"
213584,L352080,u6308,m422,J,"Hello, can I help you?"
213585,L352042,u6313,m422,NICK,"Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy."
213586,L352041,u6318,m422,TOM,"All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?"
213587,L352040,u6313,m422,NICK,"Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary."
213588,L352039,u6318,m422,TOM,"Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean."
213589,L352038,u6313,m422,NICK,"Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays."
213590,L352036,u6313,m422,NICK,Seven hundred each.
213591,L352035,u6318,m422,TOM,"They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?"
213592,L352034,u6313,m422,NICK,"I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect."
213593,L352033,u6318,m422,TOM,"Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?"
213594,L352020,u6318,m422,TOM,I think you're Nick the Greek.
213595,L352019,u6313,m422,NICK,"Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?"
213596,L352018,u6318,m422,TOM,"Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns."
213597,L352017,u6313,m422,NICK,"Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom."
213598,L352015,u6318,m422,TOM,"Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses."
213599,L352014,u6313,m422,NICK,Doesn't sound very good to me.
213600,L352013,u6318,m422,TOM,Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
213601,L351718,u6318,m422,TOM,You know it doesn't include the amp.
213602,L351717,u6313,m422,NICK,And that does include the amp?
213603,L351716,u6318,m422,TOM,"You know how much it is, Nick."
213604,L351715,u6313,m422,NICK,"How much did you say it was, Tom?"
213605,L351712,u6313,m422,NICK,"Of course you are. All right, Ed."
213606,L351711,u6318,m422,TOM,"What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal."
213607,L352159,u6314,m422,PAUL,"So I've just got to put you in, and I am off."
213608,L352158,u6319,m422,TRAFFIC WARDEN,So?
213609,L352157,u6314,m422,PAUL,My van is half full.
213610,L352156,u6319,m422,TRAFFIC WARDEN,"At what, exactly?"
213611,L352155,u6314,m422,PAUL,"Look. Go on, look."
213612,L352154,u6319,m422,TRAFFIC WARDEN,You've already been fifteen.
213613,L352153,u6314,m422,PAUL,I'll only be a minute.
213614,L352152,u6319,m422,TRAFFIC WARDEN,"You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you."
213615,L352293,u6317,m422,SOAP,"OK, don't panic; let's think about this."
213616,L352292,u6318,m422,TOM,"That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses."
213617,L352291,u6317,m422,SOAP,"The money, the gear!"
213618,L352289,u6318,m422,TOM,How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
213619,L352288,u6317,m422,SOAP,How the fuck should I know?
213620,L352287,u6318,m422,TOM,That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
213621,L352286,u6317,m422,SOAP,"Er, well, twelve."
213622,L352285,u6318,m422,TOM,How many feet?
213623,L352284,u6317,m422,SOAP,Twelve.
213624,L352283,u6318,m422,TOM,How many wings have they got between them?
213625,L352282,u6317,m422,SOAP,Six.
213626,L352281,u6318,m422,TOM,There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
213627,L352249,u6317,m422,SOAP,"Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get."
213628,L352248,u6318,m422,TOM,You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
213629,L352247,u6317,m422,SOAP,I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
213630,L352246,u6318,m422,TOM,"This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?"
213631,L352213,u6317,m422,SOAP,What about all the gear?
213632,L352212,u6318,m422,TOM,"Hold on, give us half a chance to count it."
213633,L352211,u6317,m422,SOAP,What's left over?'
213634,L352186,u6317,m422,SOAP,When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
213635,L352185,u6318,m422,TOM,"Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?"
213636,L352066,u6318,m422,TOM,Nick the Greek.
213637,L352065,u6317,m422,SOAP,"Where did you get those from, a museum?"
213638,L352012,u6317,m422,SOAP,"Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!"
213639,L352011,u6318,m422,TOM,"It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!"
213640,L352010,u6317,m422,SOAP,"Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?"
213641,L351801,u6318,m422,TOM,"Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests."

213643,L351799,u6318,m422,TOM,What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
213644,L351760,u6317,m422,SOAP,"You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not."
213645,L351759,u6318,m422,TOM,"Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course."
213646,L351758,u6317,m422,SOAP,That's going on optimism.
213647,L351757,u6318,m422,TOM,"So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences."
213648,L351722,u6317,m422,SOAP,Get your fingers out of my soup!
213649,L351721,u6318,m422,TOM,"If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?"
213650,L351720,u6317,m422,SOAP,"Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's."
213651,L351719,u6318,m422,TOM,What have you come as?
213652,L351819,u6321,m422,WINSTON,"I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy."
213653,L351818,u6320,m422,WILLY,What do you mean?
213654,L351817,u6321,m422,WINSTON,"We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?"
213655,L351816,u6320,m422,WILLY,"We need fertilizer, Winston."
213656,L351815,u6321,m422,WINSTON,"You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy."
213657,L351814,u6320,m422,WILLY,"Er, fertilizer."
213658,L351813,u6321,m422,WINSTON,"What are you carrying, Willy?"
213659,L351812,u6321,m422,WINSTON,"The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked."
213660,L351811,u6320,m422,WILLY,"Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?"
213661,L354056,u6345,m423,PALOMA,It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
213662,L354055,u6322,m423,AMADO,So?
213663,L354054,u6345,m423,PALOMA,Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
213664,L354053,u6322,m423,AMADO,Just shut up.
213665,L354052,u6345,m423,PALOMA,And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
213666,L354051,u6322,m423,AMADO,I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
213667,L354050,u6345,m423,PALOMA,Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
213668,L354049,u6322,m423,AMADO,I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
213669,L354048,u6345,m423,PALOMA,You jerk--
213670,L354425,u6322,m423,AMADO,"Catholic school, nasty."
213671,L354424,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help."
213672,L354423,u6322,m423,AMADO,And what did she do?
213673,L354422,u6347,m423,PILAR,I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
213674,L354421,u6322,m423,AMADO,"It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business."
213675,L354420,u6347,m423,PILAR,"If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled."
213676,L354419,u6322,m423,AMADO,"Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--"
213677,L354418,u6347,m423,PILAR,That isn't true.
213678,L354417,u6322,m423,AMADO,"I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste."
213679,L354416,u6347,m423,PILAR,I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
213680,L354415,u6322,m423,AMADO,You think I can't learn that?
213681,L354414,u6347,m423,PILAR,You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
213682,L354413,u6322,m423,AMADO,I can fix cars.
213683,L354412,u6347,m423,PILAR,How do you think you're going to make a living?
213684,L354411,u6347,m423,PILAR,Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
213685,L354410,u6322,m423,AMADO,They stole our land--
213686,L354409,u6347,m423,PILAR,That makes it okay?
213687,L354408,u6322,m423,AMADO,Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
213688,L354407,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things."
213689,L354406,u6322,m423,AMADO,They're not going to jail.
213690,L354405,u6347,m423,PILAR,So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
213691,L354404,u6322,m423,AMADO,So?
213692,L354403,u6347,m423,PILAR,--you're going to be on your own.
213693,L354402,u6322,m423,AMADO,I can't take any more school.
213694,L354401,u6347,m423,PILAR,I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
213695,L354047,u6322,m423,AMADO,"You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun."
213696,L354046,u6347,m423,PILAR,Leave your sister out of it.
213697,L354045,u6322,m423,AMADO,Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
213698,L354044,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Oh, come on, Amado--"
213699,L354043,u6322,m423,AMADO,If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
213700,L353854,u6347,m423,PILAR,"You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam."
213701,L353853,u6322,m423,AMADO,I don't know what the big deal is.
213702,L354652,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"Thank you, sir."

213705,L354649,u6332,m423,DEL,Why don't you start with that?
213706,L354647,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"No, sir. They all been real straight with me."
213707,L354646,u6332,m423,DEL,Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
213708,L354645,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"No, sir. Not at all."
213709,L354644,u6332,m423,DEL,Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
213710,L354643,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us."
213711,L354642,u6332,m423,DEL,"Why do you think they let us in on the ""deal""?"
213712,L354641,u6332,m423,DEL,Chaos.
213713,L354640,u6323,m423,ATHENA,Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
213714,L354639,u6332,m423,DEL,Because it's a job?
213715,L354638,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"I do, sir."
213716,L354637,u6332,m423,DEL,"With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service."
213717,L354636,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"I mean, follow orders, sir."
213718,L354635,u6332,m423,DEL,Do whatever they tell you--
213719,L354634,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you."
213720,L354633,u6332,m423,DEL,How do you think I got to be a colonel?
213721,L354632,u6323,m423,ATHENA,It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
213722,L354631,u6332,m423,DEL,Please.
213723,L354630,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"You really want to know, sir?"
213724,L354629,u6332,m423,DEL,Well?
213725,L354627,u6332,m423,DEL,And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
213726,L354626,u6323,m423,ATHENA,The--the officers.
213727,L354625,u6332,m423,DEL,"Who's ""they""?"

213729,L354623,u6332,m423,DEL,"What exactly do you think your job is, Private?"
213730,L354622,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"I am, sir."
213731,L354621,u6332,m423,DEL,You don't sound too enthusiastic.
213732,L354620,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"I-I can do the job, sir."
213733,L354619,u6332,m423,DEL,"Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?"
213734,L354618,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"Yes, sir--"
213735,L354617,u6332,m423,DEL,"When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement."

213740,L353963,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"Thank you, Sergeant Major."
213741,L353962,u6330,m423,CLIFF,You're dismissed.
213742,L353961,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"Thank you, Sergeant Major."
213743,L353960,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction."
213744,L353959,u6323,m423,ATHENA,Will this go on my record?
213745,L353958,u6330,m423,CLIFF,He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
213746,L353957,u6323,m423,ATHENA,Out of the Army?
213747,L353954,u6330,m423,CLIFF,He'll live.
213748,L353953,u6323,m423,ATHENA,Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
213749,L353952,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--"
213750,L353951,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--"
213751,L353944,u6323,m423,ATHENA,From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
213752,L353943,u6330,m423,CLIFF,So you knew this young man before?
213753,L354316,u6323,m423,ATHENA,"Yes, Sergeant."
213754,L354315,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
213755,L354314,u6323,m423,ATHENA,You're testing me?
213756,L354313,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,"I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too."

213759,L354310,u6323,m423,ATHENA,Sergeant?

213766,L353945,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,Did you know he was going to be there last night?
213767,L353906,u6351,m423,SAM,"Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail."
213768,L353905,u6324,m423,BEN,What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
213769,L353904,u6351,m423,SAM,You got to investigate. No question about it.
213770,L353903,u6324,m423,BEN,"If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen."
213771,L353902,u6351,m423,SAM,So is Buddy on your short list?
213772,L353901,u6324,m423,BEN,Just wondering.
213773,L353900,u6351,m423,SAM,He swore by it.  What?

213775,L353898,u6351,m423,SAM,Colt Peacemaker.
213776,L353897,u6324,m423,BEN,You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
213777,L353896,u6351,m423,SAM,"So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack."
213778,L353895,u6324,m423,BEN,"Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on."
213779,L353894,u6351,m423,SAM,You got a cause of death?
213780,L353893,u6324,m423,BEN,Everybody on the border knows that story.
213781,L353892,u6351,m423,SAM,You know the popular version of how he left town.
213782,L353891,u6324,m423,BEN,Yeah.
213783,L353890,u6351,m423,SAM,--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
213784,L353889,u6324,m423,BEN,That badge--
213785,L353888,u6351,m423,SAM,Charley Wade.
213786,L353887,u6324,m423,BEN,"Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--"
213787,L353886,u6351,m423,SAM,Nice job.
213788,L353885,u6324,m423,BEN,"We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones."
213789,L353884,u6351,m423,SAM,Skinny?
213790,L353883,u6324,m423,BEN,"Yeah, this is Skinny."
213791,L353882,u6351,m423,SAM,That the word on our boy?
213792,L353881,u6351,m423,SAM,"Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops."
213793,L353880,u6324,m423,BEN,Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
213794,L353879,u6351,m423,SAM,"September '97, that's all she wrote."
213795,L353878,u6324,m423,BEN,I hear they're closing that post down.
213796,L353877,u6351,m423,SAM,"Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated."
213797,L353876,u6324,m423,BEN,How's business?
213798,L353875,u6351,m423,SAM,"Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down."

213801,L353764,u6353,m423,WADE,You little pissant--
213802,L353763,u6325,m423,BUDDY,"There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy."
213803,L353762,u6353,m423,WADE,You're fired. You're outta the department.
213804,L353761,u6325,m423,BUDDY,Whole different story; isn't it?
213805,L353760,u6353,m423,WADE,Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
213806,L353759,u6325,m423,BUDDY,You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
213807,L353757,u6353,m423,WADE,"You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son."
213808,L353756,u6325,m423,BUDDY,I'm not picking it up.
213809,L353755,u6353,m423,WADE,You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
213810,L353754,u6325,m423,BUDDY,That's not the point.
213811,L353753,u6353,m423,WADE,"There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys."
213812,L353752,u6325,m423,BUDDY,"It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up."
213813,L353748,u6353,m423,WADE,"I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is ""Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."""
213814,L353747,u6325,m423,BUDDY,So?
213815,L353746,u6353,m423,WADE,"Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens."
213816,L353745,u6325,m423,BUDDY,What's that for?
213817,L354691,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam."
213818,L354690,u6351,m423,SAM,"You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you."
213819,L354689,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"""I only got my little girl now,"" he says, ""she's my lifeline."" Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people."
213820,L354688,u6351,m423,SAM,I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
213821,L354687,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow."
213822,L354686,u6351,m423,SAM,What?
213823,L354685,u6326,m423,BUNNY,350 pounds.
213824,L354683,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?"
213825,L354682,u6351,m423,SAM,"It wasn't just you, Bunny."
213826,L354681,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--"
213827,L354680,u6351,m423,SAM,Suppose not.
213828,L354679,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?"
213829,L354678,u6351,m423,SAM,"You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--"
213830,L354677,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead."
213831,L354676,u6351,m423,SAM,No. You?
213832,L354675,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"Least he never called me that. With me, it was always ""high-strung."" ""My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung."" Or ""tightly wound,"" that was another one. You seeing anyone?"
213833,L354674,u6351,m423,SAM,"Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?"
213834,L354673,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says ""Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now""."
213835,L354672,u6351,m423,SAM,Best part of the job.
213836,L354671,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"You look awful good in that uniform, though."
213837,L354670,u6351,m423,SAM,Same weight I always was.
213838,L354669,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"Daddy calls it an ""altercation."" How you doing, Sam? You look skinny."
213839,L354668,u6351,m423,SAM,You were in a fight--
213840,L354667,u6326,m423,BUNNY,--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
213841,L354666,u6351,m423,SAM,"Yeah, well--"
213842,L354665,u6326,m423,BUNNY,--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
213843,L354664,u6351,m423,SAM,You look good--
213844,L354663,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--"
213845,L354662,u6351,m423,SAM,"No, you look good. I was just wondering."
213846,L354661,u6326,m423,BUNNY,Do I seem jumpy?
213847,L354660,u6351,m423,SAM,"Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?"
213848,L354659,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6"", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?"
213849,L354658,u6351,m423,SAM,You still going to all the home games?
213850,L354657,u6351,m423,SAM,"Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--"
213851,L354656,u6326,m423,BUNNY,Oh. Right. And you're in--?
213852,L354655,u6351,m423,SAM,That's in Maverick County.
213853,L354654,u6326,m423,BUNNY,"The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--"
213854,L354719,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,He never asked her.
213855,L354718,u6332,m423,DEL,My mother said he never asked about--
213856,L354717,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
213857,L354716,u6332,m423,DEL,"It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command."
213858,L354715,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,"Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?"
213859,L354714,u6332,m423,DEL,I'm a colonel.
213860,L354713,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,"Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it."
213861,L354712,u6332,m423,DEL,Uncle Al--
213862,L354711,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
213863,L354710,u6332,m423,DEL,Where'd he get all this?
213864,L354706,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
213865,L354705,u6332,m423,DEL,I never met her.
213866,L354704,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
213867,L354703,u6332,m423,DEL,You've been in this house for a while?
213868,L354700,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,Come on in.
213869,L354699,u6332,m423,DEL,If it's too late--
213870,L354698,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,Come on in--
213871,L354697,u6332,m423,DEL,Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
213872,L354696,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,"Hey, it's the General."
213873,L354199,u6327,m423,CAROLYN,So that's him--
213874,L354198,u6332,m423,DEL,You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
213875,L354612,u6344,m423,OTIS,"Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof."
213876,L354611,u6328,m423,CHET,"My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own."
213877,L354610,u6344,m423,OTIS,By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
213878,L354609,u6328,m423,CHET,So I'm part-Indian?
213879,L354608,u6344,m423,OTIS,"These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--"
213880,L354607,u6328,m423,CHET,So how come you got into all this?
213881,L354606,u6344,m423,OTIS,When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
213882,L354605,u6328,m423,CHET,He's still pissed off about it.
213883,L354604,u6344,m423,OTIS,Didn't have a father?
213884,L354603,u6328,m423,CHET,"I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--"
213885,L354602,u6344,m423,OTIS,Well--
213886,L354601,u6328,m423,CHET,"Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--"
213887,L354600,u6344,m423,OTIS,PDA?
213888,L354599,u6328,m423,CHET,"No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--"
213889,L354598,u6344,m423,OTIS,"He's a pretty tough old man, huh?"
213890,L354597,u6328,m423,CHET,Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
213891,L354596,u6344,m423,OTIS,You didn't go telling your father you were here?
213892,L354595,u6328,m423,CHET,That guy who got shot--
213893,L354594,u6344,m423,OTIS,I got a pretty good guess.
213894,L354593,u6328,m423,CHET,You know who I am?
213895,L354592,u6344,m423,OTIS,They were in the Army. Like your father.
213896,L354591,u6328,m423,CHET,But they were Indians themselves.
213897,L354590,u6344,m423,OTIS,Same as they done in Mexico.
213898,L354589,u6328,m423,CHET,They fought against the Indians?
213899,L354588,u6344,m423,OTIS,"Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--"
213900,L354587,u6344,m423,OTIS,"They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass."
213901,L354586,u6328,m423,CHET,So they stayed in Florida?
213902,L354585,u6344,m423,OTIS,"They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee."
213903,L354584,u6328,m423,CHET,The Trail of Tears.
213904,L354583,u6344,m423,OTIS,"He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--"
213905,L354582,u6344,m423,OTIS,Both.
213906,L354581,u6328,m423,CHET,He a Black man or an Indian?
213907,L354580,u6344,m423,OTIS,Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
213908,L353795,u6344,m423,OTIS,Go out through the back.
213909,L353794,u6328,m423,CHET,No sir.
213910,L353793,u6344,m423,OTIS,"You weren't in here tonight, were you?"
213911,L354792,u6328,m423,CHET,Cool.
213912,L354791,u6332,m423,DEL,"Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over."
213913,L354790,u6332,m423,DEL,He does.
213914,L354789,u6328,m423,CHET,"Yeah. He lives here, right?"
213915,L354788,u6332,m423,DEL,My father.
213916,L354787,u6328,m423,CHET,Are we going to ever see your father?
213917,L354786,u6332,m423,DEL,Good.
213918,L354785,u6328,m423,CHET,Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
213919,L354784,u6332,m423,DEL,How's your room shaping up?
213920,L354783,u6332,m423,DEL,No.
213921,L354782,u6328,m423,CHET,You wouldn't?
213922,L354781,u6332,m423,DEL,"Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life."
213923,L354777,u6332,m423,DEL,So you're going into the Army?
213924,L354776,u6328,m423,CHET,"You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive."
213925,L354775,u6332,m423,DEL,"Tanks, huh?"
213926,L354774,u6328,m423,CHET,I finished that. I'm just messing around.
213927,L354773,u6332,m423,DEL,Homework?
213928,L354090,u6332,m423,DEL,How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
213929,L354089,u6328,m423,CHET,I have a B average.
213930,L354088,u6332,m423,DEL,"I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--"
213931,L354087,u6328,m423,CHET,"Dad, I talked to the track coach--"
213932,L354084,u6328,m423,CHET,"Dad, can I talk to you about track?"
213933,L354083,u6332,m423,DEL,Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
213934,L354081,u6332,m423,DEL,"""Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"""
213935,L354080,u6328,m423,CHET,Dad--?
213936,L354077,u6328,m423,CHET,Dad--
213937,L354076,u6332,m423,DEL,Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
213938,L354440,u6329,m423,CHUCHO,"My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--"
213939,L354439,u6351,m423,SAM,Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
213940,L354438,u6329,m423,CHUCHO,"Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?"
213941,L354435,u6351,m423,SAM,You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
213942,L354434,u6329,m423,CHUCHO,Something like that.
213943,L354433,u6351,m423,SAM,"Made some money, came back here--"
213944,L354432,u6329,m423,CHUCHO,Fifteen years in El Paso.
213945,L354431,u6351,m423,SAM,You lived in the States for a while?
213946,L354430,u6329,m423,CHUCHO,"This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber."
213947,L354429,u6351,m423,SAM,You own this place?
213948,L354428,u6329,m423,CHUCHO,"Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it."
213949,L354248,u6330,m423,CLIFF,What's it doing on a rifle range?
213950,L354247,u6341,m423,MIKEY,"They were using M-1's, yeah--"
213951,L354246,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--"
213952,L354245,u6341,m423,MIKEY,Yeah?
213953,L354244,u6330,m423,CLIFF,It's a .45.
213954,L354243,u6341,m423,MIKEY,What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
213955,L354242,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Mikey look at this--
213956,L354241,u6341,m423,MIKEY,If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
213957,L354240,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Mikey--
213958,L354239,u6341,m423,MIKEY,Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
213959,L354238,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Mikey--
213960,L354237,u6341,m423,MIKEY,"I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--"
213961,L354236,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"Hey, Mikey--"
213962,L354235,u6341,m423,MIKEY,"Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse."
213963,L354234,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
213964,L354233,u6341,m423,MIKEY,You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
213965,L354232,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Maybe.
213966,L354231,u6341,m423,MIKEY,You going to get married?
213967,L354230,u6330,m423,CLIFF,I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
213968,L354229,u6341,m423,MIKEY,Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
213969,L353873,u6330,m423,CLIFF,You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
213970,L353872,u6341,m423,MIKEY,Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
213971,L353860,u6341,m423,MIKEY,We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
213972,L353859,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
213973,L353688,u6341,m423,MIKEY,He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
213974,L353687,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,"
213975,L353675,u6341,m423,MIKEY,Cliff--

213977,L353673,u6341,m423,MIKEY,Cliff--
213978,L353672,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear."
213979,L353671,u6341,m423,MIKEY,Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
213980,L353670,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--"
213981,L353669,u6341,m423,MIKEY,You finding lots of cactus and shit?
213982,L353668,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head."
213983,L353667,u6341,m423,MIKEY,Right.
213984,L353666,u6330,m423,CLIFF,It's a lead mine.
213985,L353665,u6341,m423,MIKEY,What?
213986,L353664,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Lead mine.
213987,L353663,u6341,m423,MIKEY,This place is a gold mine.
213988,L354161,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,You know who it was they dug up?
213989,L354160,u6330,m423,CLIFF,They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
213990,L354151,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
213991,L354150,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that."
213992,L354149,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,"It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--"
213993,L354148,u6330,m423,CLIFF,You could take it--
213994,L354147,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
213995,L354146,u6330,m423,CLIFF,We should just do it.
213996,L354145,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,We been through this before--
213997,L354144,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"Seriously, I think we should get married."
213998,L354143,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,Seriously.
213999,L354142,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course."
214000,L354141,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,So where does that put us?
214001,L353967,u6330,m423,CLIFF,She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
214002,L353966,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
214003,L353965,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
214004,L353964,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,"You spoil 'em, Cliff."
214005,L353956,u6330,m423,CLIFF,He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
214006,L353955,u6348,m423,PRISCILLA,He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
214007,L354155,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
214008,L354154,u6351,m423,SAM,Pleased to meet you.
214009,L354153,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
214010,L353686,u6330,m423,CLIFF,Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
214011,L353685,u6351,m423,SAM,Treasure hunter?
214012,L353684,u6351,m423,SAM,Masons been around a long while.
214013,L353683,u6330,m423,CLIFF,That ring--
214014,L353682,u6351,m423,SAM,I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
214015,L353681,u6330,m423,CLIFF,"This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction."
214016,L353680,u6351,m423,SAM,I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
214017,L354140,u6331,m423,CODY,"Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold."
214018,L354139,u6351,m423,SAM,Yeah. I bet he would.
214019,L354138,u6331,m423,CODY,--but just as a kind of safety tip.
214020,L354137,u6331,m423,CODY,--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
214021,L354135,u6331,m423,CODY,Take that pair over in the corner--
214022,L354134,u6351,m423,SAM,"You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job."
214023,L354133,u6331,m423,CODY,"You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar."
214024,L354132,u6351,m423,SAM,"Good deal you were born down here, then."
214025,L354131,u6331,m423,CODY,"--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout."
214026,L354130,u6351,m423,SAM,If the next guy's a redneck.
214027,L354129,u6331,m423,CODY,Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
214028,L353871,u6341,m423,MIKEY,"Appreciate it, sir."
214029,L353870,u6332,m423,DEL,I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
214030,L353866,u6332,m423,DEL,I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
214031,L353865,u6341,m423,MIKEY,"Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--"
214032,L353864,u6332,m423,DEL,Substance abuse?
214033,L353863,u6341,m423,MIKEY,"You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--"
214034,L353858,u6332,m423,DEL,Have we had trouble there before?
214035,L353857,u6341,m423,MIKEY,"There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in."
214036,L354197,u6344,m423,OTIS,Because I'm your father.
214037,L354196,u6332,m423,DEL,Why would you want to do that?
214038,L354195,u6344,m423,OTIS,I gonna meet that family of yours?
214039,L354194,u6344,m423,OTIS,A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
214040,L354193,u6332,m423,DEL,And people make their choice--
214041,L354192,u6344,m423,OTIS,"Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place."
214042,L354191,u6332,m423,DEL,"I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown."
214043,L354190,u6344,m423,OTIS,Right.
214044,L354189,u6332,m423,DEL,"The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is."
214045,L354188,u6344,m423,OTIS,"I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here."
214046,L354187,u6332,m423,DEL,That's right.
214047,L354186,u6344,m423,OTIS,"Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call."
214048,L354185,u6332,m423,DEL,We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
214049,L354184,u6344,m423,OTIS,"Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born."
214050,L354183,u6332,m423,DEL,I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
214051,L354182,u6344,m423,OTIS,"This is an official visit, then--"
214052,L354181,u6332,m423,DEL,So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
214053,L354180,u6344,m423,OTIS,So.
214054,L354178,u6332,m423,DEL,"Nice to meet you, Ma'am."
214055,L354177,u6344,m423,OTIS,"This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore."
214056,L354176,u6344,m423,OTIS,If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
214057,L354175,u6332,m423,DEL,Deal drugs in the bathroom--
214058,L354174,u6344,m423,OTIS,"It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--"
214059,L354173,u6332,m423,DEL,You get much of that in here?
214060,L354172,u6344,m423,OTIS,That's where he fell.
214061,L354171,u6332,m423,DEL,That where he was shot?
214062,L354170,u6344,m423,OTIS,"Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission."
214063,L354169,u6332,m423,DEL,Black Seminoles?
214064,L354463,u6353,m423,WADE,"Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that."
214065,L354462,u6333,m423,ELADIO,Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
214066,L354461,u6353,m423,WADE,"You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now."
214067,L354460,u6333,m423,ELADIO,Protection?
214068,L354459,u6353,m423,WADE,There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
214069,L354458,u6353,m423,WADE,"Bandidos, Injuns--"
214070,L354457,u6333,m423,ELADIO,Reputation?
214071,L354456,u6353,m423,WADE,"You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--"
214072,L354455,u6333,m423,ELADIO,Eladio Cruz.
214073,L354454,u6353,m423,WADE,"This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?"
214074,L354453,u6333,m423,ELADIO,I haven't seen anybody doing that.
214075,L354452,u6353,m423,WADE,I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
214076,L354451,u6333,m423,ELADIO,"Not much, jefe. Some watermelons."
214077,L354450,u6353,m423,WADE,What's in the back?
214078,L354449,u6333,m423,ELADIO,"No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]"
214079,L354448,u6353,m423,WADE,"Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]"
214080,L354765,u6333,m423,ELADIO,Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]

214158,L354816,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it."
214159,L354815,u6351,m423,SAM,Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
214160,L354812,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--"
214161,L354811,u6351,m423,SAM,And the ten thousand?
214162,L354810,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
214163,L354805,u6351,m423,SAM,Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
214164,L354804,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Buddy Deeds--
214165,L354803,u6351,m423,SAM,"Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--"
214166,L354802,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
214167,L354801,u6351,m423,SAM,Imonna find out one way or the other.
214168,L354796,u6351,m423,SAM,Open late.
214169,L354795,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"Hey, Sam."
214170,L354794,u6351,m423,SAM,Fellas.
214171,L354578,u6351,m423,SAM,"I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight."
214172,L354577,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?"
214173,L354576,u6351,m423,SAM,"I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back."
214174,L354575,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Do you?
214175,L354574,u6351,m423,SAM,I got an idea what happened.
214176,L354573,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't."
214177,L354572,u6351,m423,SAM,Charley Wade.
214178,L354571,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,We have a murder?
214179,L354570,u6351,m423,SAM,You thought any more about our murder?
214180,L354569,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
214181,L354568,u6351,m423,SAM,"Morning, Hollis."
214182,L353939,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,And I understand why you might want to think he could.
214183,L353938,u6351,m423,SAM,"People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it."
214184,L353937,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
214185,L353936,u6351,m423,SAM,And Buddy was one of them.
214186,L353935,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years."
214187,L353934,u6351,m423,SAM,"Besides my father, I mean."
214188,L353933,u6351,m423,SAM,Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
214189,L353932,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?"
214190,L353931,u6351,m423,SAM,He still living?
214191,L353930,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
214192,L353929,u6351,m423,SAM,Bledso
214193,L353928,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--"
214194,L353927,u6351,m423,SAM,"You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?"
214195,L353926,u6351,m423,SAM,All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
214196,L353925,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
214197,L353924,u6351,m423,SAM,You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
214198,L353923,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
214199,L353922,u6351,m423,SAM,We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
214200,L353921,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
214201,L353920,u6351,m423,SAM,No.
214202,L353919,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,You go by your old house?
214203,L353918,u6351,m423,SAM,I haven't been out here for a while.
214204,L353917,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
214205,L353916,u6351,m423,SAM,"Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--"
214206,L353915,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
214207,L353914,u6351,m423,SAM,I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
214208,L353779,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--"
214209,L353778,u6351,m423,SAM,Right.
214210,L353777,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
214211,L353774,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
214212,L353773,u6351,m423,SAM,Never heard from him again?
214213,L353735,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part."
214214,L353734,u6351,m423,SAM,That so?
214215,L353731,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
214216,L353730,u6351,m423,SAM,--Santiago.
214217,L353729,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
214218,L353723,u6337,m423,HOLLIS,"Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd."
214219,L353722,u6351,m423,SAM,I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
214220,L354225,u6351,m423,SAM,"Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail."
214221,L354224,u6338,m423,JORGE,There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
214222,L354221,u6351,m423,SAM,"It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--"
214223,L354220,u6338,m423,JORGE,There was a mandate in the last election--
214224,L354215,u6351,m423,SAM,Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
214225,L354214,u6338,m423,JORGE,He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
214226,L354213,u6351,m423,SAM,The Perdido thing?
214227,L354212,u6338,m423,JORGE,I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
214228,L354209,u6351,m423,SAM,"You ought to put up a banner-- ""Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy""--"
214229,L354208,u6338,m423,JORGE,Sam--
214230,L354207,u6351,m423,SAM,People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
214231,L354206,u6338,m423,JORGE,"We're building up tourism, Sam--"
214232,L354510,u6339,m423,MARISOL,You told me one time it was true love.
214233,L354509,u6347,m423,PILAR,I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
214234,L354508,u6339,m423,MARISOL,"The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--"
214235,L354507,u6347,m423,PILAR,The Sheriff.
214236,L354506,u6339,m423,MARISOL,How 'bout the Sheriff?
214237,L354505,u6347,m423,PILAR,All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
214238,L354504,u6339,m423,MARISOL,You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
214239,L354503,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner."
214240,L354502,u6339,m423,MARISOL,Your mother's family is Spanish?
214241,L354501,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack."
214242,L354500,u6339,m423,MARISOL,"Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell."
214243,L354499,u6347,m423,PILAR,Steve?
214244,L354498,u6339,m423,MARISOL,Steve called for you.
214245,L354124,u6347,m423,PILAR,"""That boy""--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!"
214246,L354123,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,I never said that. It was just that boy--
214247,L354122,u6347,m423,PILAR,What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
214248,L354121,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,I felt that you could do better for yourself--
214249,L354120,u6347,m423,PILAR,You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
214250,L354119,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,I never said that.
214251,L354118,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- ""some chulo with grease under his nails."""
214252,L354117,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,I don't mean Fernando.
214253,L354116,u6347,m423,PILAR,Thank you.
214254,L354115,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,"Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?"
214255,L354114,u6347,m423,PILAR,Nobody's too busy.
214256,L354113,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,I was too busy.
214257,L354112,u6347,m423,PILAR,There must have been somebody.
214258,L354111,u6347,m423,PILAR,How come you never got married again?
214259,L354110,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,A little older than Paloma is now.
214260,L354109,u6347,m423,PILAR,Right. When he was killed.
214261,L354108,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,He was killed.
214262,L354107,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Mami, how old were you when my father--"
214263,L354106,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,"You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them."
214264,L354105,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--"
214265,L354104,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,Why would I want to go there?
214266,L354103,u6347,m423,PILAR,No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
214267,L354102,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
214268,L354101,u6347,m423,PILAR,If you spent a little more time training them--
214269,L354100,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,"Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy."
214270,L354099,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Well, you hire illegals--"
214271,L354098,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,"If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!"
214272,L354097,u6347,m423,PILAR,Maybe you're just getting less patient.
214273,L354096,u6340,m423,MERCEDES,These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
214274,L353991,u6351,m423,SAM,Do you remember the last time you saw him?
214275,L353990,u6342,m423,MINNIE,Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
214276,L353989,u6351,m423,SAM,People didn't complain?
214277,L353988,u6342,m423,MINNIE,"Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite."
214278,L353987,u6351,m423,SAM,And my father?
214279,L353986,u6342,m423,MINNIE,"Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, ""Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership."" But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime."
214280,L353985,u6351,m423,SAM,He squeezed money out of you?
214281,L353984,u6342,m423,MINNIE,"Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for."
214282,L353983,u6351,m423,SAM,You had to deal with him in running the club.
214283,L353982,u6342,m423,MINNIE,Not if I can help it.
214284,L353981,u6351,m423,SAM,So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
214285,L353980,u6342,m423,MINNIE,We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
214286,L353979,u6351,m423,SAM,He had the club out on the old trail road--
214287,L353978,u6342,m423,MINNIE,"I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away."
214288,L353977,u6351,m423,SAM,You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
214289,L353976,u6342,m423,MINNIE,"Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone."
214290,L353975,u6351,m423,SAM,I've seen 'em.
214291,L353974,u6342,m423,MINNIE,You ever play one of these?
214292,L353973,u6351,m423,SAM,"Yeah, that's the story of my life."
214293,L353972,u6342,m423,MINNIE,"Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior."
214294,L353971,u6351,m423,SAM,I'm Sheriff Deeds--
214295,L353970,u6342,m423,MINNIE,That's me.
214296,L353969,u6351,m423,SAM,Mrs. Bledsoe?
214297,L354496,u6347,m423,PILAR,"I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--"
214298,L354495,u6343,m423,MOLLY,I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
214299,L354494,u6347,m423,PILAR,I don't think you can take it personally--
214300,L353705,u6347,m423,PILAR,He's going to wish he was dead.
214301,L353704,u6343,m423,MOLLY,No. Is he sick?
214302,L353703,u6347,m423,PILAR,Okay? He's not here?
214303,L353702,u6343,m423,MOLLY,"Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?"
214304,L354799,u6344,m423,OTIS,"Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up."
214305,L354798,u6351,m423,SAM,Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
214306,L354797,u6344,m423,OTIS,I'm not open. We were just talking.
214307,L354041,u6351,m423,SAM,He ever accept cash for a favor?
214308,L354040,u6344,m423,OTIS,"Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged."
214309,L354039,u6351,m423,SAM,What was your deal with him?
214310,L354038,u6344,m423,OTIS,What about it?
214311,L354037,u6351,m423,SAM,And when my father was Sheriff?
214312,L354036,u6344,m423,OTIS,Could of been. That was white people's business.
214313,L354035,u6351,m423,SAM,That was the night he disappeared?
214314,L354034,u6344,m423,OTIS,"Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope."
214315,L354033,u6351,m423,SAM,And that was the last time you saw him?
214316,L354032,u6344,m423,OTIS,I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
214317,L354566,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys."
214318,L354565,u6345,m423,PALOMA,How come?
214319,L354564,u6347,m423,PILAR,I only went for my last two years.
214320,L354563,u6345,m423,PALOMA,Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
214321,L354562,u6347,m423,PILAR,Enough with the clothes--
214322,L354561,u6345,m423,PALOMA,I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
214323,L354560,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma."
214324,L354559,u6345,m423,PALOMA,Can I get this?
214325,L354558,u6347,m423,PILAR,Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
214326,L354557,u6345,m423,PALOMA,You got in late last night.
214327,L354556,u6347,m423,PILAR,It's Saturday.
214328,L354555,u6345,m423,PALOMA,She finally got in--
214329,L354351,u6347,m423,PILAR,What do you think?
214330,L354350,u6345,m423,PALOMA,What's she singing about?
214331,L354349,u6347,m423,PILAR,For a while.
214332,L354348,u6345,m423,PALOMA,You gonna stay out here?
214333,L354347,u6347,m423,PILAR,Yeah?
214334,L354346,u6345,m423,PALOMA,Mom?
214335,L354060,u6347,m423,PILAR,It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
214336,L354059,u6345,m423,PALOMA,What?
214337,L354058,u6347,m423,PILAR,Of course you can.
214338,L354057,u6345,m423,PALOMA,Not if you have half a brain in your head.
214339,L354378,u6346,m423,PETE,Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
214340,L354377,u6351,m423,SAM,Murdered him?
214341,L354376,u6346,m423,PETE,He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
214342,L354375,u6351,m423,SAM,I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
214343,L354374,u6346,m423,PETE,"Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--"
214344,L354373,u6351,m423,SAM,You built our patio while you  were on the county?
214345,L354372,u6346,m423,PETE,It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
214346,L354371,u6351,m423,SAM,"Well, you were working there--"
214347,L354370,u6346,m423,PETE,And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
214348,L354369,u6351,m423,SAM,So I've heard--
214349,L354368,u6346,m423,PETE,He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
214350,L354367,u6351,m423,SAM,I'm surprised he bothered with it.
214351,L354366,u6346,m423,PETE,That's how I ruined my stomach.
214352,L354365,u6346,m423,PETE,Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
214353,L354364,u6351,m423,SAM,I thought he busted you a couple times.
214354,L354363,u6346,m423,PETE,Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
214355,L354362,u6346,m423,PETE,I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
214356,L354361,u6351,m423,SAM,You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
214357,L354360,u6346,m423,PETE,It was for personal consumption.
214358,L354359,u6351,m423,SAM,"You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight."
214359,L354358,u6346,m423,PETE,Three months.
214360,L354357,u6351,m423,SAM,How much you got left?
214361,L354356,u6346,m423,PETE,Time marches on.
214362,L354355,u6351,m423,SAM,"Hey, Pete. How's it going?"
214363,L354354,u6346,m423,PETE,"Morning, Sheriff."
214364,L354836,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?"
214365,L354835,u6351,m423,SAM,Yeah--
214366,L354834,u6347,m423,PILAR,We start from scratch--
214367,L354833,u6351,m423,SAM,"If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you."
214368,L354832,u6347,m423,PILAR,"I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--"
214369,L354830,u6351,m423,SAM,I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
214370,L354829,u6347,m423,PILAR,From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
214371,L354828,u6351,m423,SAM,"He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you ""our beautiful daughter"" in the letters she wrote to him."
214372,L354827,u6347,m423,PILAR,They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
214373,L354826,u6351,m423,SAM,"Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--"
214374,L354825,u6347,m423,PILAR,I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
214375,L354824,u6351,m423,SAM,Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
214376,L354823,u6347,m423,PILAR,Couple months before I was born--
214377,L354822,u6351,m423,SAM,You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
214378,L354821,u6347,m423,PILAR,"She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean."
214379,L354820,u6351,m423,SAM,You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
214380,L354554,u6347,m423,PILAR,Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
214381,L354553,u6351,m423,SAM,What was your father's name?
214382,L354552,u6347,m423,PILAR,Yeah?
214383,L354551,u6351,m423,SAM,Pilar--
214384,L354550,u6347,m423,PILAR,It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
214385,L354549,u6351,m423,SAM,"I've felt that way, yeah."
214386,L354548,u6347,m423,PILAR,Like your story is over.
214387,L354547,u6351,m423,SAM,Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
214388,L354546,u6347,m423,PILAR,There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
214389,L354545,u6351,m423,SAM,Two years.
214390,L354544,u6347,m423,PILAR,How long have you lived here?
214391,L354543,u6351,m423,SAM,"More, I hope."
214392,L354542,u6347,m423,PILAR,So what are we gonna do about this?
214393,L354541,u6351,m423,SAM,I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
214394,L354540,u6347,m423,PILAR,How come it feels the same?
214395,L354539,u6351,m423,SAM,Yeah.
214396,L354538,u6347,m423,PILAR,Wow.
214397,L354536,u6351,m423,SAM,I came back 'cause you were here.
214398,L354535,u6347,m423,PILAR,Yeah?
214399,L354534,u6351,m423,SAM,"You know the other day, you asked why I came back?"
214400,L354533,u6347,m423,PILAR,When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
214401,L354532,u6351,m423,SAM,Nothing.
214402,L354531,u6347,m423,PILAR,I mean what did we know about anything?
214403,L354530,u6351,m423,SAM,Yeah.
214404,L354529,u6347,m423,PILAR,"I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children."
214405,L354528,u6351,m423,SAM,Yeah.
214406,L354527,u6347,m423,PILAR,"We thought we were something, didn't we?"
214407,L354299,u6347,m423,PILAR,"Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam."
214408,L354298,u6351,m423,SAM,Pilar--
214409,L354297,u6347,m423,PILAR,I should get back.
214410,L354295,u6347,m423,PILAR,They've got me. Different thing.
214411,L354294,u6351,m423,SAM,"You've got your mother, your kids--"
214412,L354293,u6347,m423,PILAR,"It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own."
214413,L354292,u6351,m423,SAM,"I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows."
214414,L354291,u6347,m423,PILAR,You don't want to be Sheriff.
214415,L354290,u6351,m423,SAM,"Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--"
214416,L354289,u6347,m423,PILAR,"So why did you come back here, Sam?"
214417,L354288,u6351,m423,SAM,It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
214418,L354287,u6347,m423,PILAR,Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
214419,L354286,u6351,m423,SAM,"Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--"
214420,L354285,u6347,m423,PILAR,"With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal."
214421,L354284,u6351,m423,SAM,No--
214422,L354283,u6347,m423,PILAR,He hates me.
214423,L354282,u6351,m423,SAM,Nice-looking kid.
214424,L354281,u6347,m423,PILAR,Amado.
214425,L354280,u6351,m423,SAM,"Your boy, there--"
214426,L354279,u6347,m423,PILAR,Weird what you remember.
214427,L354278,u6351,m423,SAM,Yeah.
214428,L354277,u6347,m423,PILAR,"I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--"
214429,L354276,u6347,m423,PILAR,I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
214430,L354275,u6351,m423,SAM,"Most people did, yeah."
214431,L354274,u6347,m423,PILAR,People liked him.
214432,L354273,u6351,m423,SAM,They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
214433,L354272,u6347,m423,PILAR,I thought you got through that pretty well.
214434,L354271,u6347,m423,PILAR,So she tells me three times a week.
214435,L354270,u6351,m423,SAM,She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
214436,L354269,u6347,m423,PILAR,A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
214437,L354268,u6351,m423,SAM,I see she built a place up here by the river.
214438,L354267,u6347,m423,PILAR,I can't name anybody she does like these days.
214439,L354266,u6351,m423,SAM,Your mother still doesn't like me.
214440,L354265,u6351,m423,SAM,Want to take a walk?
214441,L354264,u6347,m423,PILAR,Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
214442,L354263,u6351,m423,SAM,Field trip?
214443,L353852,u6347,m423,PILAR,Are you okay?
214444,L353851,u6351,m423,SAM,He's all yours.
214445,L353839,u6351,m423,SAM,Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
214446,L353838,u6347,m423,PILAR,We haven't talked since high school.
214447,L353837,u6351,m423,SAM,I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
214448,L353836,u6351,m423,SAM,I'll see what's going on.
214449,L353835,u6347,m423,PILAR,Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
214450,L353834,u6351,m423,SAM,Got him here?
214451,L353833,u6347,m423,PILAR,They've got my Amado.
214452,L353832,u6351,m423,SAM,Something wrong?
214453,L354399,u6349,m423,RAY,"Well, it's a complicated issue--"
214454,L354398,u6351,m423,SAM,You think we need a new jail?
214455,L354397,u6351,m423,SAM,I appreciate you telling me.
214456,L354396,u6349,m423,RAY,I didn't want to be going around your back.
214457,L354395,u6351,m423,SAM,Don't know if I'll still want it.
214458,L354394,u6349,m423,RAY,How 'bout you?
214459,L354393,u6351,m423,SAM,You'd do a good job.
214460,L354392,u6349,m423,RAY,Yeah.
214461,L354391,u6351,m423,SAM,They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
214462,L354390,u6349,m423,RAY,Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
214463,L354389,u6349,m423,RAY,Oh.
214464,L354388,u6351,m423,SAM,Gotta be in person.
214465,L354387,u6349,m423,RAY,They got telephones.
214466,L354386,u6351,m423,SAM,No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
214467,L354385,u6349,m423,RAY,The Republicans?
214468,L354384,u6351,m423,SAM,I'm going over to the other side.
214469,L354383,u6349,m423,RAY,Uh-huh.
214470,L354382,u6351,m423,SAM,I been working on a few things.
214471,L354381,u6349,m423,RAY,Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.

214473,L354379,u6349,m423,RAY,You're out early.
214474,L353830,u6351,m423,SAM,Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
214475,L353829,u6349,m423,RAY,Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
214476,L353828,u6351,m423,SAM,Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
214477,L353827,u6349,m423,RAY,Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
214478,L353826,u6351,m423,SAM,The shooter local?
214479,L353825,u6349,m423,RAY,Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
214480,L354324,u6352,m423,SHADOW,You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
214481,L354323,u6349,m423,RAY,"This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come."
214482,L354322,u6352,m423,SHADOW,White man just using you to keep the Black man down.

214485,L354319,u6349,m423,RAY,"You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--"
214486,L354318,u6352,m423,SHADOW,You don't need to cuff me.
214487,L354317,u6349,m423,RAY,"Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed."
214488,L354029,u6353,m423,WADE,And people better clear out of here! Now!
214489,L354028,u6350,m423,RODERICK,"This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--"
214490,L354027,u6353,m423,WADE,"What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--"
214491,L354026,u6350,m423,RODERICK,"No, Sheriff, I'm just--"
214492,L354025,u6353,m423,WADE,"You telling me what to do, Roderick?"
214493,L354024,u6350,m423,RODERICK,"You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--"
214494,L354023,u6350,m423,RODERICK,"Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--"
214495,L354022,u6353,m423,WADE,"That the problem, son?  You Slow?"
214496,L354021,u6350,m423,RODERICK,"Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--"
214497,L354342,u6359,m423,ZACK,"The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--"
214498,L354341,u6351,m423,SAM,Sure.
214499,L354340,u6359,m423,ZACK,I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.

214502,L354337,u6351,m423,SAM,I haven't seen anybody come by.
214503,L354336,u6359,m423,ZACK,"We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way."
214504,L354335,u6351,m423,SAM,What's up?
214505,L354334,u6359,m423,ZACK,Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
214506,L354491,u6354,m423,WESLEY,"The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--"
214507,L354490,u6351,m423,SAM,You know who it was?
214508,L354489,u6354,m423,WESLEY,Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
214509,L354488,u6351,m423,SAM,Another woman?
214510,L354487,u6354,m423,WESLEY,"If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later."
214511,L354486,u6354,m423,WESLEY,Me neither.
214512,L354485,u6351,m423,SAM,No--
214513,L354484,u6354,m423,WESLEY,They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
214514,L354483,u6351,m423,SAM,You think he killed anybody in Korea?
214515,L354482,u6354,m423,WESLEY,"For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on."
214516,L354481,u6351,m423,SAM,So when did Buddy leave?
214517,L354480,u6354,m423,WESLEY,Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
214518,L354477,u6354,m423,WESLEY,"But you don't see much competition, do you?"
214519,L354476,u6351,m423,SAM,Hell of a spot to put a business.
214520,L354475,u6354,m423,WESLEY,How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
214521,L354474,u6351,m423,SAM,You sell much out here?
214522,L354473,u6354,m423,WESLEY,--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
214523,L354015,u6353,m423,WADE,"Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there."
214524,L354014,u6356,m423,YOUNG OTIS,Been away. Up to Houston.
214525,L354013,u6353,m423,WADE,How come you don't took familiar?
214526,L354009,u6353,m423,WADE,Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that.
214527,L354008,u6356,m423,YOUNG OTIS,Runnin' numbers illegal.
214528,L354007,u6353,m423,WADE,"As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?"
214529,L354005,u6353,m423,WADE,Why you think that was?
214530,L354004,u6356,m423,YOUNG OTIS,I know that.
214531,L354003,u6353,m423,WADE,I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
214532,L354002,u6356,m423,YOUNG OTIS,Uh-huh.
214533,L354001,u6353,m423,WADE,One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
214534,L354000,u6356,m423,YOUNG OTIS,Payne.
214535,L353999,u6353,m423,WADE,Otis what?
214536,L353998,u6356,m423,YOUNG OTIS,Name's Otis.
214537,L353997,u6353,m423,WADE,I know you?
214538,L354306,u6358,m423,YOUNG SAM,You believe that?
214539,L354305,u6357,m423,YOUNG PILAR,"It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other."
214540,L354304,u6358,m423,YOUNG SAM,"So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?"
214541,L354303,u6357,m423,YOUNG PILAR,He's gonna find out.
214542,L354302,u6358,m423,YOUNG SAM,He doesn't need to know all my business.
214543,L354301,u6357,m423,YOUNG PILAR,You going to tell him?
214544,L354300,u6358,m423,YOUNG SAM,You going to tell her?
214545,L354938,u6367,m424,HARRY,You bet.
214546,L354937,u6360,m424,BELLBOY,"Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour."
214547,L354936,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Hello, L.A."
214548,L354933,u6367,m424,HARRY,Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
214549,L354932,u6360,m424,BELLBOY,Thirty-five bucks.
214550,L354931,u6367,m424,HARRY,How much?
214551,L354930,u6360,m424,BELLBOY,You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
214552,L354929,u6367,m424,HARRY,Yeah?
214553,L354923,u6367,m424,HARRY,Yeah.  It's French.
214554,L354922,u6360,m424,BELLBOY,Mister D'Amour?
214555,L355369,u6361,m424,BILLY,"Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough."
214556,L355368,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Thanks, Billy."
214557,L355365,u6361,m424,BILLY,"I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?"
214558,L355364,u6367,m424,HARRY,Hokey enough for you?
214559,L355359,u6361,m424,BILLY,Knew what?
214560,L355358,u6367,m424,HARRY,That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
214561,L355357,u6361,m424,BILLY,"Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time."
214562,L355356,u6367,m424,HARRY,What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
214563,L355355,u6361,m424,BILLY,"I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?"
214564,L355354,u6367,m424,HARRY,Maybe they're not tricks.
214565,L355352,u6367,m424,HARRY,A Nix specialty?
214566,L355351,u6361,m424,BILLY,Take a look at this.
214567,L355349,u6361,m424,BILLY,doorway) And who's that?
214568,L355348,u6367,m424,HARRY,That's Butterfield...
214569,L355345,u6367,m424,HARRY,That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
214570,L355344,u6361,m424,BILLY,I could have lost my fucking hands.
214571,L355339,u6361,m424,BILLY,Nope.
214572,L355338,u6367,m424,HARRY,Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
214573,L355337,u6361,m424,BILLY,I love weird.
214574,L355336,u6367,m424,HARRY,My life was too weird for her.
214575,L355335,u6361,m424,BILLY,Why?
214576,L355334,u6367,m424,HARRY,Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
214577,L355333,u6361,m424,BILLY,You ever been married?
214578,L355332,u6367,m424,HARRY,You heard right.
214579,L355331,u6361,m424,BILLY,I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
214580,L355328,u6361,m424,BILLY,It'll be something hokey.
214581,L355327,u6367,m424,HARRY,How?
214582,L355326,u6361,m424,BILLY,I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
214583,L355230,u6361,m424,BILLY,I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
214584,L355229,u6367,m424,HARRY,Who is he?
214585,L355228,u6361,m424,BILLY,Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
214586,L355227,u6367,m424,HARRY,Nix?
214587,L355226,u6361,m424,BILLY,Nix.
214588,L355225,u6367,m424,HARRY,Who?
214589,L355224,u6361,m424,BILLY,I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
214590,L355223,u6367,m424,HARRY,They go together.
214591,L355222,u6361,m424,BILLY,"I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole."
214592,L354927,u6362,m424,BLONDE GIRL,That's so cool.
214593,L354926,u6367,m424,HARRY,Right.
214594,L354921,u6362,m424,BLONDE GIRL,Isn't that French for something?
214595,L354920,u6367,m424,HARRY,Right.
214596,L354919,u6362,m424,BLONDE GIRL,D'Amour.
214597,L354918,u6367,m424,HARRY,D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
214598,L354917,u6362,m424,BLONDE GIRL,How'd you spell that again?
214599,L355147,u6367,m424,HARRY,All right.  It was...
214600,L355146,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Who did this?
214601,L355145,u6367,m424,HARRY,I told you --
214602,L355144,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Who did this?
214603,L355143,u6367,m424,HARRY,Deep shit?
214604,L355142,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,"You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?"
214605,L355141,u6367,m424,HARRY,Beats me.
214606,L355140,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Why would I do that?
214607,L355139,u6367,m424,HARRY,You did.  Didn't you?
214608,L354998,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,It's an illusion.
214609,L354997,u6370,m424,MILLER,What about death?
214610,L354996,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Death.
214611,L354995,u6370,m424,MILLER,About?
214612,L354994,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
214613,L354993,u6370,m424,MILLER,"What do you mean, ""all of us?"""
214614,L354992,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
214615,L354991,u6370,m424,MILLER,He won't.
214616,L354990,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,I don't want him getting in the way.
214617,L354989,u6370,m424,MILLER,No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
214618,L354988,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,He's a priest?
214619,L354987,u6370,m424,MILLER,I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
214620,L354986,u6370,m424,MILLER,I know him.  I saw him.
214621,L354985,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
214622,L355547,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,It's him... it's him.
214623,L355546,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
214624,L355539,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
214625,L355538,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,If you've lied to me to me --
214626,L355537,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Not yet.
214627,L355536,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Anything?
214628,L355467,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,You'll do more.than that.
214629,L355466,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,I'll tell you.
214630,L355464,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,I don't know.
214631,L355463,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,So tell me where Nix is buried.
214632,L355462,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Don't.
214633,L355461,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,I could scoop them out.
214634,L355460,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Please.
214635,L355534,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Maybe he'll show you.
214636,L355533,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,What is he?
214637,L355532,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,"If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not."
214638,L355531,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?"
214639,L355530,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
214640,L355529,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Why did you wait so long?
214641,L355528,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,"Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free."
214642,L355504,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,It was me.
214643,L355503,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
214644,L355585,u6364,m424,CULTISTS,He's with us... He's with us...
214645,L355584,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,He's with us...
214646,L355577,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Be ready.
214647,L355576,u6364,m424,CULTISTS,Yes...
214648,L355575,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Will you come to him on your knees?
214649,L355574,u6364,m424,CULTISTS,Yes...
214650,L355573,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Do you wish him to be amongst us?
214651,L355234,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
214652,L355233,u6372,m424,QUAID,Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
214653,L354956,u6372,m424,QUAID,Yes.
214654,L354955,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,And are you afraid?
214655,L354954,u6372,m424,QUAID,Yes.
214656,L354953,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
214657,L354952,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
214658,L354951,u6372,m424,QUAID,Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
214659,L354950,u6363,m424,BUTTERFIELD,"Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it."
214660,L355695,u6367,m424,HARRY,Out!  Out!
214661,L355694,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Harry-?
214662,L355693,u6367,m424,HARRY,What the fuck?
214663,L355691,u6367,m424,HARRY,I think so.
214664,L355690,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Is it finished?
214665,L355675,u6367,m424,HARRY,I'm okay.  I'm okay.
214666,L355674,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Harry?
214667,L355670,u6367,m424,HARRY,I... have... to.
214668,L355669,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Don't look.
214669,L355667,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Yes.
214670,L355666,u6367,m424,HARRY,...yes?
214671,L355665,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"I'm here, Harry."
214672,L355664,u6367,m424,HARRY,... oh... God...
214673,L355661,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Harry...
214674,L355660,u6367,m424,HARRY,No!  No!  No!
214675,L355636,u6367,m424,HARRY,Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
214676,L355635,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,You can't.
214677,L355634,u6367,m424,HARRY,I've got to help him.
214678,L355623,u6367,m424,HARRY,Hang on!
214679,L355622,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Oh God!
214680,L355435,u6367,m424,HARRY,It's all right.  It's not hurting...
214681,L355434,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Harry?
214682,L355430,u6367,m424,HARRY,Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
214683,L355429,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Are you all right?
214684,L355418,u6367,m424,HARRY,It's okay.
214685,L355417,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,What was that?
214686,L355416,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
214687,L355415,u6367,m424,HARRY,Quaid and Jennifer--
214688,L355414,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Yes.
214689,L355413,u6367,m424,HARRY,And they all came...
214690,L355412,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him."
214691,L355411,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
214692,L355410,u6367,m424,HARRY,I'm sure.  He's dead.
214693,L355409,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Are you sure?
214694,L355408,u6367,m424,HARRY,Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
214695,L355407,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,I was so afraid.
214696,L355406,u6367,m424,HARRY,Nothing you don't want.
214697,L355405,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Nothing?
214698,L355404,u6367,m424,HARRY,Nothing's going to happen to you.
214699,L355403,u6367,m424,HARRY,"I'm here, aren't I?"
214700,L355402,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,No it isn't.  You can't help me.
214701,L355401,u6367,m424,HARRY,It's okay.
214702,L355399,u6367,m424,HARRY,"He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?"
214703,L355398,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it."
214704,L355397,u6367,m424,HARRY,What then?
214705,L355396,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,I wasn't.
214706,L355395,u6367,m424,HARRY,You said you weren't with him for love.
214707,L355394,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,No.
214708,L355393,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours."
214709,L355392,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,I told you --
214710,L355391,u6367,m424,HARRY,"So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions."
214711,L355390,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Some or it.
214712,L355389,u6367,m424,HARRY,He taught all this to Swann?
214713,L355388,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
214714,L355387,u6367,m424,HARRY,Stuff?
214715,L355386,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"Swann said he could do stuff, yes."
214716,L355385,u6367,m424,HARRY,"He was the real thing, right?"
214717,L355384,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"It was more than that, I think."
214718,L355383,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?"
214719,L355382,u6367,m424,HARRY,Why don't you tell me the truth?
214720,L355381,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Oh Christ.
214721,L355380,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon."
214722,L355379,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,What did you find?
214723,L355378,u6367,m424,HARRY,I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
214724,L355377,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
214725,L355253,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Yes.  You do that.
214726,L355252,u6367,m424,HARRY,Okay.  I'll keep digging.
214727,L355251,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
214728,L355250,u6367,m424,HARRY,What about Jennifer Desiderio?
214729,L355249,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
214730,L355248,u6367,m424,HARRY,Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
214731,L355247,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,That's my business. Harry.
214732,L355246,u6367,m424,HARRY,So why did you marry him?
214733,L355245,u6367,m424,HARRY,You didn't marry him for love.
214734,L355244,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,He... didn't have me..  I told you-
214735,L355243,u6367,m424,HARRY,Why?  Because he had you?
214736,L355242,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,They were jealous of him.
214737,L355241,u6367,m424,HARRY,I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
214738,L355240,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,How did it go today?
214739,L355165,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here."
214740,L355164,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
214741,L355163,u6367,m424,HARRY,I can be very persuasive.
214742,L355162,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,They won't tell you anything.
214743,L355161,u6367,m424,HARRY,Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
214744,L355160,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,I don't know where you'd start.
214745,L355159,u6367,m424,HARRY,"I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look..."
214746,L355158,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
214747,L355157,u6367,m424,HARRY,Are they treating you okay?
214748,L355120,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,You haven't seen anything yet.
214749,L355119,u6367,m424,HARRY,He's good.
214750,L355090,u6367,m424,HARRY,Sure.
214751,L355089,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?"
214752,L355088,u6367,m424,HARRY,Do you?
214753,L355087,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
214754,L355086,u6367,m424,HARRY,When do you want me to start?
214755,L355085,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
214756,L355084,u6367,m424,HARRY,I'm no bodyguard.
214757,L355083,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Harry.
214758,L355082,u6367,m424,HARRY,Harry.
214759,L355081,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?"
214760,L355080,u6367,m424,HARRY,Where do I sign?
214761,L355079,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,"
214762,L355078,u6367,m424,HARRY,Sorry.  You asked.
214763,L355077,u6367,m424,HARRY,He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
214764,L355076,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,You don't believe me.
214765,L355075,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
214766,L355074,u6367,m424,HARRY,But obviously you still care what happens to him.
214767,L355073,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
214768,L355072,u6367,m424,HARRY,Does that mean...?
214769,L355071,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
214770,L355070,u6367,m424,HARRY,And you don't ask questions?
214771,L355069,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,He's a secretive man.
214772,L355068,u6367,m424,HARRY,Why not?
214773,L355067,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
214774,L355066,u6367,m424,HARRY,What's the connection?
214775,L355065,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,I think we make our own futures.
214776,L355064,u6367,m424,HARRY,You don't?
214777,L355063,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards."
214778,L355062,u6367,m424,HARRY,Did your husband know Quaid?
214779,L355061,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
214780,L355451,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
214781,L355450,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,What about me?
214782,L355321,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,I left three messages already.
214783,L355320,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel."
214784,L355319,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
214785,L355318,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,No word from D'Amour?
214786,L355317,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
214787,L355021,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,You saw this?
214788,L355020,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Good.  There.  Yes?
214789,L355019,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Valentin?
214790,L355017,u6373,m424,SWANN,No.  I'm not going near him.
214791,L355016,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,"Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?"
214792,L355015,u6373,m424,SWANN,I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
214793,L355014,u6373,m424,SWANN,I just saw him.
214794,L355013,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Oh God.
214795,L355012,u6373,m424,SWANN,Somebody killed him.
214796,L355011,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Sure.
214797,L355010,u6373,m424,SWANN,Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
214798,L355009,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,... they believe you.
214799,L355008,u6373,m424,SWANN,The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
214800,L355007,u6365,m424,DOROTHEA,Bad show last night?
214801,L355156,u6367,m424,HARRY,No.  Not yet...
214802,L355155,u6366,m424,EDDISON,For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
214803,L355154,u6367,m424,HARRY,Are you finished with me?
214804,L355153,u6366,m424,EDDISON,Another fucking magician. Jesus.
214805,L355152,u6367,m424,HARRY,--vanished.
214806,L355151,u6366,m424,EDDISON,And this Butterfield guy--
214807,L354983,u6366,m424,EDDISON,After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
214808,L354982,u6367,m424,HARRY,He got up and walked.
214809,L354981,u6366,m424,EDDISON,Where the fuck is he?
214810,L354980,u6366,m424,EDDISON,New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
214811,L354979,u6367,m424,HARRY,I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
214812,L354978,u6366,m424,EDDISON,What makes you so sure?
214813,L354977,u6367,m424,HARRY,Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
214814,L354976,u6366,m424,EDDISON,"Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield."
214815,L354975,u6367,m424,HARRY,I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
214816,L354974,u6366,m424,EDDISON,What were you doing up there?
214817,L355220,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,Fuck you.
214818,L355219,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?"
214819,L355217,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
214820,L355216,u6367,m424,HARRY,With what?
214821,L355215,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
214822,L355214,u6367,m424,HARRY,Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
214823,L355213,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
214824,L355212,u6367,m424,HARRY,I'd like to hear them.
214825,L355211,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,"Oh, I've got plenty."
214826,L355210,u6367,m424,HARRY,You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
214827,L355209,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,If he was so good why's he so dead?
214828,L355208,u6367,m424,HARRY,I heard he was the best.
214829,L355207,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,They weren't worth a damn.
214830,L355206,u6367,m424,HARRY,What about Swann's miracles?
214831,L355205,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,"I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation."
214832,L355204,u6367,m424,HARRY,So could you walk on water?
214833,L355203,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,"No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists."
214834,L355202,u6367,m424,HARRY,Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
214835,L355201,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,Trickery and divinity.
214836,L355200,u6367,m424,HARRY,Heaven and Hell?
214837,L355199,u6376,m424,VINOVICH,"I think we walk a narrow path, between... between..."
214838,L355198,u6367,m424,HARRY,You believe that?
214839,L355566,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
214840,L355565,u6367,m424,HARRY,What about?
214841,L355564,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,"I'm sorry, D'Amour..."
214842,L355563,u6367,m424,HARRY,Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
214843,L355562,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Don't bother.
214844,L355561,u6367,m424,HARRY,We've got to get you to a hospital.
214845,L355560,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Him too.
214846,L355554,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Help me.
214847,L355553,u6367,m424,HARRY,Shit...
214848,L355552,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,D'Amour --
214849,L355449,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
214850,L355448,u6367,m424,HARRY,I want to see Swann face to face.
214851,L355447,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
214852,L355446,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake."
214853,L355445,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,"No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after."
214854,L355444,u6367,m424,HARRY,Was that Swann's idea?
214855,L355443,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,I tried to pay you off.
214856,L355442,u6367,m424,HARRY,"And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann"
214857,L355441,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Yes.
214858,L355440,u6367,m424,HARRY,You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
214859,L355439,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Yes.
214860,L355438,u6367,m424,HARRY,"You rigged the illusion to fail, right?"
214861,L355433,u6367,m424,HARRY,No.
214862,L355432,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Are you satisfied now?
214863,L355375,u6367,m424,HARRY,Shut up!
214864,L355374,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Leave her alone --
214865,L355372,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,"You want more money, is that it?"
214866,L355371,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Yeah, I know."
214867,L355370,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,I can't let you in.
214868,L355315,u6367,m424,HARRY,When will she be in?
214869,L355314,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,I'm afraid she's not in.
214870,L355313,u6367,m424,HARRY,I want to speak to Dorothea.
214871,L355271,u6367,m424,HARRY,No.
214872,L355270,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,"Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home."
214873,L355269,u6367,m424,HARRY,I like to know why things happen.
214874,L355268,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,What for?  You need to stay busy?
214875,L355267,u6367,m424,HARRY,Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
214876,L355266,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Yes.  It's regrettable
214877,L355265,u6367,m424,HARRY,Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
214878,L355264,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
214879,L355263,u6367,m424,HARRY,"You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her."
214880,L355262,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,"A ticket home,"
214881,L355261,u6367,m424,HARRY,What for?
214882,L355260,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,"You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars."
214883,L355259,u6367,m424,HARRY,Why'd you come here?
214884,L355258,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
214885,L355257,u6367,m424,HARRY,What the fuck are you doing here?
214886,L355060,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Swann's wife.
214887,L355059,u6367,m424,HARRY,Who is she?
214888,L355057,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,"Are you a believer, then?"
214889,L355056,u6367,m424,HARRY,Are you sure?
214890,L355055,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,I don't think the dead much care.
214891,L355054,u6367,m424,HARRY,It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
214892,L355053,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Probably.
214893,L355052,u6367,m424,HARRY,Any movie stars buried here?
214894,L355051,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
214895,L355050,u6367,m424,HARRY,What's the difference?
214896,L355049,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
214897,L355048,u6367,m424,HARRY,When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
214898,L355047,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Are you a gambling man?
214899,L355046,u6367,m424,HARRY,I saw him in Vegas once.
214900,L355045,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,You know of him?
214901,L355044,u6367,m424,HARRY,Philip Swann?
214902,L355043,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,"You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world."
214903,L355042,u6367,m424,HARRY,Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
214904,L355041,u6367,m424,HARRY,Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
214905,L355040,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Maybe I just bought it.
214906,L355039,u6367,m424,HARRY,Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
214907,L355038,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Mine.
214908,L355037,u6367,m424,HARRY,Whose is the car?
214909,L355035,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
214910,L355034,u6367,m424,HARRY,I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
214911,L355033,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,I'm here to offer you a job.
214912,L355032,u6367,m424,HARRY,Then what do you want?
214913,L355031,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,We've never met.
214914,L355030,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --"
214915,L355029,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,"I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night."
214916,L355028,u6367,m424,HARRY,"What are you, my mother?"
214917,L355027,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,It's one in the afternoon.
214918,L355026,u6367,m424,HARRY,Go away.
214919,L355025,u6375,m424,VALENTIN,Mr. D'Amour?
214920,L355024,u6367,m424,HARRY,Shit.
214921,L355283,u6367,m424,HARRY,And what does Jennifer think's real?
214922,L355282,u6374,m424,TOFFLER,Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
214923,L355281,u6367,m424,HARRY,Does anybody?
214924,L355280,u6374,m424,TOFFLER,She has no real grip on reality.
214925,L355279,u6367,m424,HARRY,What's her problem?
214926,L355278,u6374,m424,TOFFLER,"Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever."
214927,L355277,u6367,m424,HARRY,I won't say anything.
214928,L355276,u6374,m424,TOFFLER,"Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told."
214929,L355275,u6367,m424,HARRY,A Mister Quaid?
214930,L355274,u6374,m424,TOFFLER,Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
214931,L354972,u6367,m424,HARRY,Who is he?
214932,L354971,u6372,m424,QUAID,Yes...
214933,L354970,u6367,m424,HARRY,The Puritan?
214934,L354969,u6372,m424,QUAID,I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
214935,L354968,u6367,m424,HARRY,Hold on.
214936,L354967,u6372,m424,QUAID,You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
214937,L354966,u6367,m424,HARRY,Not much.
214938,L354965,u6372,m424,QUAID,"You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that."
214939,L354964,u6367,m424,HARRY,Yeah.  You could say that.
214940,L354963,u6372,m424,QUAID,You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
214941,L354962,u6367,m424,HARRY,What?
214942,L354961,u6372,m424,QUAID,My God.
214943,L354959,u6372,m424,QUAID,Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
214944,L354958,u6367,m424,HARRY,You need an ambulance.
214945,L355194,u6377,m424,WILDER,"No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer."
214946,L355193,u6367,m424,HARRY,Have you been in?
214947,L355192,u6377,m424,WILDER,That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
214948,L355191,u6377,m424,WILDER,It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
214949,L355190,u6367,m424,HARRY,Are they all in the business?
214950,L355189,u6377,m424,WILDER,You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
214951,L355188,u6367,m424,HARRY,I only wear ties for funerals.
214952,L355186,u6367,m424,HARRY,Well... nobody.
214953,L355185,u6377,m424,WILDER,For an introduction.
214954,L355184,u6367,m424,HARRY,For what?
214955,L355183,u6377,m424,WILDER,People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
214956,L355182,u6367,m424,HARRY,I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
214957,L355181,u6377,m424,WILDER,"He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit."
214958,L355180,u6367,m424,HARRY,Sure.  Vivovich.
214959,L355179,u6377,m424,WILDER,You know Vinovich?
214960,L355176,u6367,m424,HARRY,Not the Walter Wilder?
214961,L355175,u6377,m424,WILDER,"You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way."
214962,L355174,u6367,m424,HARRY,Was he taking a lot of risks?
214963,L355173,u6377,m424,WILDER,"What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business."
214964,L355172,u6367,m424,HARRY,I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
214965,L355171,u6377,m424,WILDER,I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
214966,L355170,u6367,m424,HARRY,Harry D'Amour.
214967,L355169,u6377,m424,WILDER,At birth.  I don't know you --
214968,L355168,u6367,m424,HARRY,That.
214969,L355167,u6377,m424,WILDER,What?
214970,L355166,u6367,m424,HARRY,Where'd you learn that?
214971,L355685,u6367,m424,HARRY,Try.
214972,L355684,u6373,m424,SWANN,I don't know.
214973,L355683,u6367,m424,HARRY,Can you do it?
214974,L355682,u6373,m424,SWANN,Yes?
214975,L355681,u6367,m424,HARRY,He did something with the ground.
214976,L355606,u6373,m424,SWANN,I can't... I can't go any further...
214977,L355605,u6367,m424,HARRY,You didn't try hard enough.
214978,L355604,u6373,m424,SWANN,This is where we killed him.
214979,L355591,u6367,m424,HARRY,Fuck.
214980,L355590,u6373,m424,SWANN,At a guess... they just resurrected him.
214981,L355589,u6367,m424,HARRY,Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
214982,L355572,u6367,m424,HARRY,"In my time, and nobody else's."
214983,L355571,u6373,m424,SWANN,That's where we're all going.
214984,L355570,u6373,m424,SWANN,"You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour."
214985,L355569,u6367,m424,HARRY,Nobody's better off this wav!
214986,L355568,u6373,m424,SWANN,He's better off this way.
214987,L355567,u6367,m424,HARRY,... no...
214988,L355549,u6373,m424,SWANN,Looks that way.
214989,L355548,u6367,m424,HARRY,They got here before us.
214990,L355527,u6367,m424,HARRY,Jesus!
214991,L355526,u6373,m424,SWANN,Yes.
214992,L355525,u6367,m424,HARRY,Who else did?  Did Valentin?
214993,L355524,u6373,m424,SWANN,No.
214994,L355523,u6367,m424,HARRY,Did she know where Nix was buried?
214995,L355518,u6373,m424,SWANN,"I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?"
214996,L355517,u6367,m424,HARRY,And you believed him?
214997,L355516,u6373,m424,SWANN,"No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit..."
214998,L355515,u6367,m424,HARRY,Is that all?
214999,L355514,u6373,m424,SWANN,He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
215000,L355513,u6367,m424,HARRY,And he didn't have them?
215001,L355512,u6373,m424,SWANN,"Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations."
215002,L355511,u6367,m424,HARRY,And you're not?
215003,L355510,u6373,m424,SWANN,I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
215004,L355509,u6367,m424,HARRY,Is that all?
215005,L355508,u6373,m424,SWANN,"I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about..."
215006,L355507,u6367,m424,HARRY,Didn't know you read minds.
215007,L355506,u6373,m424,SWANN,You think I'm an asshole.
215008,L355499,u6373,m424,SWANN,Will that do?  No?
215009,L355498,u6367,m424,HARRY,Oh Jeez.
215010,L355491,u6367,m424,HARRY,Help me.
215011,L355490,u6373,m424,SWANN,I don't know what else to do.
215012,L355489,u6367,m424,HARRY,And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
215013,L355488,u6373,m424,SWANN,It's me betrayed him.
215014,L355487,u6367,m424,HARRY,So Nix won't come looking for her?
215015,L355486,u6373,m424,SWANN,"Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her."
215016,L355485,u6367,m424,HARRY,Oh yeah?
215017,L355484,u6373,m424,SWANN,I did it for Dorothea.
215018,L355483,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?"
215019,L355482,u6373,m424,SWANN,He deserved it.
215020,L355481,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Or murdered, like Nix."
215021,L355480,u6373,m424,SWANN,"Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned."
215022,L355479,u6367,m424,HARRY,"You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick."
215023,L355477,u6373,m424,SWANN,Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
215024,L355476,u6367,m424,HARRY,I don't think so.  You need me alive.
215025,L355475,u6373,m424,SWANN,Now I'm going to have to kill you.
215026,L355474,u6367,m424,HARRY,How the fuck do you do that?
215027,L355473,u6373,m424,SWANN,"You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour."
215028,L355472,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Look, Ma, no wires."
215029,L355471,u6373,m424,SWANN,They'll never find out.
215030,L355470,u6367,m424,HARRY,A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
215031,L355102,u6369,m424,LOOMIS,Who is she?
215032,L355101,u6367,m424,HARRY,What?
215033,L355100,u6369,m424,LOOMIS,One question.
215034,L355099,u6367,m424,HARRY,A couple of weeks.
215035,L355098,u6369,m424,LOOMIS,Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
215036,L355097,u6367,m424,HARRY,"There's other guys as good as me, Loomis."
215037,L355096,u6369,m424,LOOMIS,Call me tomorrow.
215038,L355095,u6367,m424,HARRY,I got to go.  I'm late.
215039,L355094,u6369,m424,LOOMIS,"You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?"
215040,L355093,u6367,m424,HARRY,No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
215041,L355092,u6369,m424,LOOMIS,The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
215042,L355307,u6368,m424,JENNIFER,No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
215043,L355306,u6367,m424,HARRY,And he's dead?
215044,L355305,u6368,m424,JENNIFER,Yes! Yes!
215045,L355304,u6367,m424,HARRY,Is he the Puritan?
215046,L355303,u6368,m424,JENNIFER,Nix! Nix!
215047,L355302,u6367,m424,HARRY,Who's not?
215048,L355301,u6368,m424,JENNIFER,He's not!  He's not!
215049,L355296,u6367,m424,HARRY,Swann?
215050,L355295,u6368,m424,JENNIFER,I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
215051,L355294,u6367,m424,HARRY,What is?
215052,L355293,u6368,m424,JENNIFER,He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
215053,L355292,u6367,m424,HARRY,Why's that?
215054,L355291,u6368,m424,JENNIFER,I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
215055,L355290,u6367,m424,HARRY,What about Philip Swann?
215056,L355289,u6368,m424,JENNIFER,Maybe... I... don't...
215057,L355288,u6367,m424,HARRY,"Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield."
215058,L355287,u6368,m424,JENNIFER,"Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,"
215059,L355286,u6367,m424,HARRY,No.
215060,L355285,u6368,m424,JENNIFER,Have we met before?
215061,L355646,u6371,m424,NIX,Liar!
215062,L355645,u6373,m424,SWANN,No!
215063,L355644,u6371,m424,NIX,Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
215064,L355643,u6373,m424,SWANN,Yes.
215065,L355642,u6371,m424,NIX,But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
215066,L355641,u6373,m424,SWANN,Yes.
215067,L355640,u6371,m424,NIX,You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
215068,L355633,u6371,m424,NIX,"The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me"
215069,L355632,u6373,m424,SWANN,Not true.
215070,L355631,u6371,m424,NIX,Because you've got nothing else to live for.
215071,L355630,u6373,m424,SWANN,Why would I want to?
215072,L355629,u6371,m424,NIX,You could still help me do that.
215073,L355628,u6371,m424,NIX,"I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world."
215074,L355627,u6373,m424,SWANN,And?
215075,L354908,u6373,m424,SWANN,Binding you.
215076,L354907,u6371,m424,NIX,Swann?  What are you doing?
215077,L354898,u6371,m424,NIX,"You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?"
215078,L354897,u6373,m424,SWANN,Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
215079,L354884,u6373,m424,SWANN,No!
215080,L354883,u6371,m424,NIX,You don't think I've got it to give?
215081,L354882,u6373,m424,SWANN,Fuck you.

215153,L356732,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,You made it.
215154,L356724,u6378,m425,BOB,Because that would be too easy.
215155,L356723,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?"
215156,L356722,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I know, but that's what you like about me."
215157,L356721,u6378,m425,BOB,You are.
215158,L356720,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,John thinks I'm so snotty.
215159,L356719,u6378,m425,BOB,I know.
215160,L356718,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there."
215161,L356717,u6378,m425,BOB,Where'd you grow up?
215162,L356716,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much."
215163,L356715,u6378,m425,BOB,"But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you."
215164,L356714,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,No one ever tells you that...
215165,L356713,u6378,m425,BOB,When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
215166,L356712,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,That's too scary.
215167,L356711,u6378,m425,BOB,"We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything."
215168,L356710,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Oh.
215169,L356709,u6378,m425,BOB,We established that we have no communication.
215170,L356708,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Did that help? Did you learn anything?
215171,L356707,u6378,m425,BOB,It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
215172,L356706,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"And marriage, does that get easier?"
215173,L356705,u6378,m425,BOB,That's ok.
215174,L356704,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"But, I'm mean."
215175,L356703,u6378,m425,BOB,You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
215176,L356702,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet..."
215177,L356701,u6378,m425,BOB,"Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way..."
215178,L356700,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Yeah? But look at you.
215179,L356699,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, yes, it does..."
215180,L356698,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
215181,L356697,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,I know.
215182,L356696,u6378,m425,BOB,You're possessive.
215183,L356695,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Oh.
215184,L356694,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show."
215185,L356693,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh, for her show?"
215186,L356692,u6378,m425,BOB,I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
215187,L356691,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
215188,L356690,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, I was looking at you."
215189,L356689,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
215190,L356688,u6378,m425,BOB,"Ok, whatever you want."
215191,L356687,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun."
215192,L356686,u6378,m425,BOB,"I don't know. My fax said ""have a good fright""."
215193,L356685,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
215194,L356684,u6378,m425,BOB,"I know, I kind of blend in here."
215195,L356683,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,I don't remember.
215196,L356682,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, you smiled."
215197,L356681,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Did I scowl at you?
215198,L356680,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yeah, you don't remember?"
215199,L356679,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Really?
215200,L356678,u6378,m425,BOB,But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
215201,L356677,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
215202,L356676,u6378,m425,BOB,I don't know.
215203,L356675,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
215204,L356674,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, its easy."
215205,L356673,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
215206,L356672,u6378,m425,BOB,Hans was very attentive to you.
215207,L356671,u6378,m425,BOB,I see them every morning.
215208,L356670,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Hey look, it's Sausalito."
215209,L356669,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"OK, see you downstairs."
215210,L356668,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs."

215374,L356562,u6381,m425,JOHN,That's ok.

215385,L356530,u6381,m425,JOHN,"I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is."
215386,L356529,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Why do you have to defend her?
215387,L356528,u6381,m425,JOHN,"Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter."
215388,L356526,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Evelyn Waugh was a man.
215389,L356525,u6381,m425,JOHN,What?

215396,L356576,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I."
215397,L356575,u6383,m425,LAUREN,Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
215398,L356574,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,Lauren?

215406,L356513,u6381,m425,JOHN,We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
215407,L356512,u6382,m425,KELLY,...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
215408,L356511,u6382,m425,KELLY,Promoting that action movie I did...
215409,L356510,u6381,m425,JOHN,"I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?"
215410,L356509,u6382,m425,KELLY,John! What are you doing here?
215411,L359126,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,We're still going to be together.
215412,L359125,u6398,m426,PETER,"You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you."
215413,L359124,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!"
215414,L359123,u6398,m426,PETER,So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
215415,L359122,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"She's been stalking you, Peter."
215416,L359121,u6398,m426,PETER,I found the pentacle.
215417,L359120,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?"
215418,L359118,u6398,m426,PETER,I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
215419,L359117,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,Must be a spare set.
215420,L359116,u6398,m426,PETER,I found them in your file box.
215421,L359115,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,I don't know.  What are they?
215422,L359114,u6398,m426,PETER,What're these?
215423,L359112,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,This is the person...you were talking about?
215424,L359111,u6398,m426,PETER,Claire...
215425,L359110,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?"
215426,L358981,u6398,m426,PETER,I believe in you.
215427,L358980,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,You need to believe in something besides yourself.
215428,L358979,u6398,m426,PETER,I'm just temporarily off my game.
215429,L358978,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"Well, it shattered your faith in everything."
215430,L358977,u6398,m426,PETER,"It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it."
215431,L358976,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
215432,L358975,u6398,m426,PETER,"Yeah, like..."
215433,L358974,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out..."
215434,L358973,u6398,m426,PETER,You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
215435,L358972,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened."
215436,L358971,u6398,m426,PETER,I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
215437,L358900,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,Thank God he did.
215438,L358899,u6398,m426,PETER,I can't believe Will killed him.
215439,L358898,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,I'm still shaking.
215440,L358895,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,When did they find her?
215441,L358894,u6398,m426,PETER,"Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef."
215442,L358892,u6398,m426,PETER,What happened?
215443,L358891,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,What?  That's horrible!
215444,L358819,u6398,m426,PETER,"Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the ""stop"" button?"
215445,L358818,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,I spaced out.
215446,L358817,u6398,m426,PETER,Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
215447,L358816,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?"
215448,L358796,u6398,m426,PETER,No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
215449,L358795,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this."
215450,L358794,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there."
215451,L358793,u6398,m426,PETER,Says she can get me in to see this killer.
215452,L358792,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
215453,L358791,u6398,m426,PETER,Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
215454,L358790,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"Peter, where are you?"
215455,L358789,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?"
215456,L358788,u6398,m426,PETER,Hmmm.
215457,L358787,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
215458,L358786,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,Sushi.
215459,L358785,u6398,m426,PETER,Uh...sure...I...what?
215460,L358784,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
215461,L358783,u6398,m426,PETER,Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
215462,L358782,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,Bad?
215463,L358781,u6398,m426,PETER,"Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream."
215464,L358668,u6398,m426,PETER,It's probably trivial.
215465,L358667,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,You never said anything to me...
215466,L358635,u6398,m426,PETER,"It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay."
215467,L358634,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
215468,L358623,u6398,m426,PETER,She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
215469,L358622,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
215470,L358621,u6398,m426,PETER,Do you think they have a room here?
215471,L358620,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,I missed you.
215472,L358659,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,Eight.  That okay?
215473,L358658,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,What time did you make it for?
215474,L358657,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it."
215475,L358640,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,Yes.  It's exactly...
215476,L358639,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"...you wearing a watch, Father?"
215477,L358638,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,"Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you..."
215478,L358637,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
215479,L358636,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,"Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?"
215480,L358632,u6387,m426,CLAIRE,"Peter, are you okay?"
215481,L358631,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,What a...jerk!
215482,L358579,u6396,m426,MR. SILBERMAN,Just me.
215483,L358578,u6388,m426,DEFENSE ATTORNEY,Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
215484,L358577,u6396,m426,MR. SILBERMAN,He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
215485,L358576,u6388,m426,DEFENSE ATTORNEY,On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
215486,L358575,u6396,m426,MR. SILBERMAN,Seemed...on edge.
215487,L358574,u6388,m426,DEFENSE ATTORNEY,"And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?"
215488,L358573,u6396,m426,MR. SILBERMAN,Quiet.  Real quiet...
215489,L358572,u6388,m426,DEFENSE ATTORNEY,And how would you describe him?
215490,L358571,u6396,m426,MR. SILBERMAN,Yes.
215491,L358803,u6388,m426,DEFENSE ATTORNEY,I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
215492,L358802,u6403,m426,VIZNICK,I can take care of myself.
215493,L358801,u6388,m426,DEFENSE ATTORNEY,You have to tell me who did it.
215494,L358800,u6403,m426,VIZNICK,Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
215495,L358799,u6388,m426,DEFENSE ATTORNEY,"Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges."
215496,L358798,u6403,m426,VIZNICK,It's nothing.
215497,L358797,u6388,m426,DEFENSE ATTORNEY,"George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?"
215498,L358841,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
215499,L358840,u6398,m426,PETER,So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
215500,L358839,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,"You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all."
215501,L358838,u6398,m426,PETER,"No, I wasn't, actually."
215502,L358837,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
215503,L358836,u6398,m426,PETER,My secretary?
215504,L358835,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,"When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too."
215505,L358834,u6398,m426,PETER,"Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor."
215506,L358833,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,"Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan."
215507,L358553,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,I think I should join you.
215508,L358552,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified."
215509,L358551,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,"I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient."
215510,L358550,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"It's the patient's request, doctor."
215511,L358549,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
215512,L358548,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,But your patient is legally entitled to it.
215513,L358547,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,You know I'm not comfortable with this.
215514,L358546,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"Your court order, Dr. Allen."
215515,L358848,u6393,m426,MAYA,"You heard voices, you know you did."
215516,L358847,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
215517,L358846,u6393,m426,MAYA,"And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?"
215518,L358845,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
215519,L358844,u6393,m426,MAYA,What did you hear?
215520,L358843,u6389,m426,DR. ALLEN,I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
215521,L358842,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?"
215522,L359155,u6390,m426,FATHER FRANK,I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
215523,L359154,u6393,m426,MAYA,You'll do it?
215524,L358970,u6390,m426,FATHER FRANK,You have a sister in New Orleans.
215525,L358969,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Father, I have nowhere else to stay."
215526,L358968,u6390,m426,FATHER FRANK,"I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church."
215527,L358709,u6393,m426,MAYA,I hope so.
215528,L358708,u6390,m426,FATHER FRANK,Is he going to be okay?
215529,L358699,u6390,m426,FATHER FRANK,But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
215530,L358698,u6393,m426,MAYA,He will.  He has great faith.
215531,L358697,u6390,m426,FATHER FRANK,The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
215532,L358687,u6390,m426,FATHER FRANK,"Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions."
215533,L358686,u6393,m426,MAYA,"If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?"
215534,L358685,u6390,m426,FATHER FRANK,"Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense."
215535,L358684,u6393,m426,MAYA,You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
215536,L358683,u6390,m426,FATHER FRANK,"I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature."
215537,L359215,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
215538,L359214,u6398,m426,PETER,You killed my parents.
215539,L359213,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
215540,L359212,u6398,m426,PETER,"You raised me, like a son."
215541,L359211,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,"Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge."
215542,L359210,u6398,m426,PETER,"You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did."
215543,L359209,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,"It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away."
215544,L359208,u6398,m426,PETER,So all that bullshit about God and faith.
215545,L359207,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,"Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn."
215546,L359206,u6398,m426,PETER,You fucking bastard.
215547,L358912,u6398,m426,PETER,"You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will."
215548,L358911,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
215549,L358910,u6398,m426,PETER,"But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life."
215550,L358909,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,"No matter, my son, he believes in you."
215551,L358908,u6398,m426,PETER,"You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it."
215552,L358907,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,"Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?"
215553,L358906,u6398,m426,PETER,Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
215554,L358905,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,He spoke to you?
215555,L358904,u6398,m426,PETER,"Something he said, just before..."
215556,L358903,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,What is it?
215557,L358630,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,"Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?"
215558,L358629,u6398,m426,PETER,You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
215559,L358628,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,"Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit."
215560,L358625,u6398,m426,PETER,You ready?
215561,L358624,u6391,m426,FATHER JAMES,How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
215562,L359181,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"...art sank, sun set, ark sank again..."
215563,L359180,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Father, please don't die."
215564,L359145,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"Miette, come here and relax."
215565,L359144,u6393,m426,MAYA,So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
215566,L359143,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted."
215567,L359142,u6393,m426,MAYA,"So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan..."
215568,L359141,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"Um hm.  That's right, Maya."
215569,L359140,u6393,m426,MAYA,We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
215570,L359139,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"Yes.  We won, that's right."
215571,L359138,u6393,m426,MAYA,So...we won?
215572,L359135,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen."
215573,L359134,u6393,m426,MAYA,"What do you mean ""don't worry?"""
215574,L359133,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya."
215575,L359132,u6393,m426,MAYA,Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
215576,L358695,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again..."
215577,L358694,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Father, I'm right here."
215578,L358693,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again."
215579,L358555,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"Just open the door, please."
215580,L358554,u6393,m426,MAYA,-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
215581,L358542,u6392,m426,LAREAUX,"I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength."
215582,L358541,u6393,m426,MAYA,Why are you doing this to me?
215583,L358729,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Oh, thank you, thank you so much!"
215584,L358728,u6399,m426,RECEPTIONIST,Two negatives always make a positive.
215585,L358726,u6393,m426,MAYA,I didn't know what else to do...
215586,L358725,u6399,m426,RECEPTIONIST,You just call?
215587,L358724,u6393,m426,MAYA,Peter...Peter Kelson.
215588,L358723,u6399,m426,RECEPTIONIST,What's his name?
215589,L358722,u6393,m426,MAYA,Well I know he's come here before.
215590,L358721,u6399,m426,RECEPTIONIST,You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
215591,L358720,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says ""Goodbye?"""
215592,L358719,u6399,m426,RECEPTIONIST,How many weeks are you honey/
215593,L358718,u6393,m426,MAYA,"I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate."
215594,L358714,u6399,m426,RECEPTIONIST,"Kelson, hold on a second..."
215595,L358713,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson."
215596,L359231,u6398,m426,PETER,It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
215597,L359230,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Oh, Peter."
215598,L359226,u6393,m426,MAYA,Not a lot.
215599,L359225,u6398,m426,PETER,How much time do we have?
215600,L359198,u6398,m426,PETER,And what's that mean?
215601,L359197,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  ""But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."""
215602,L359192,u6398,m426,PETER,"And his message was  ""Together, no matter what?"""
215603,L359191,u6393,m426,MAYA,He was trying to tell me something.
215604,L359190,u6398,m426,PETER,Terrific.
215605,L359189,u6393,m426,MAYA,"That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, ""together, no matter what."""
215606,L359188,u6398,m426,PETER,What did he say to you in French?
215607,L359187,u6393,m426,MAYA,He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
215608,L359186,u6398,m426,PETER,"So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?"
215609,L359185,u6393,m426,MAYA,"I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes."
215610,L359153,u6393,m426,MAYA,"You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him."
215611,L359152,u6398,m426,PETER,What can I do?
215612,L359109,u6398,m426,PETER,Sure.
215613,L359108,u6393,m426,MAYA,Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
215614,L359107,u6398,m426,PETER,I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
215615,L359106,u6393,m426,MAYA,What are these?
215616,L359105,u6398,m426,PETER,Plenty of time.
215617,L359101,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay."
215618,L359100,u6398,m426,PETER,What about after?
215619,L359099,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Until it happens, you're still a human being."
215620,L359098,u6398,m426,PETER,Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
215621,L359097,u6393,m426,MAYA,Maybe that's my problem.
215622,L359096,u6398,m426,PETER,No oxygen to the brain.
215623,L359095,u6393,m426,MAYA,"I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me."
215624,L359094,u6398,m426,PETER,"Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous."
215625,L359093,u6393,m426,MAYA,I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
215626,L359092,u6398,m426,PETER,Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
215627,L359087,u6398,m426,PETER,That's true.
215628,L359086,u6393,m426,MAYA,You have to say that.
215629,L359085,u6398,m426,PETER,We're going to do this.
215630,L359084,u6393,m426,MAYA,I'm scared I'm slipping back.
215631,L359083,u6393,m426,MAYA,"I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it."
215632,L359082,u6398,m426,PETER,What do you mean?
215633,L359081,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions."
215634,L359080,u6398,m426,PETER,Are you alright?
215635,L359076,u6393,m426,MAYA,Comfort.
215636,L359075,u6398,m426,PETER,What's the bible for?
215637,L359074,u6393,m426,MAYA,There's nothing else here.
215638,L359073,u6398,m426,PETER,I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
215639,L359072,u6393,m426,MAYA,"He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?"
215640,L359070,u6398,m426,PETER,That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
215641,L359069,u6393,m426,MAYA,It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
215642,L359068,u6393,m426,MAYA,Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
215643,L359067,u6398,m426,PETER,"Hang on, get it up, go on, higher."
215644,L359066,u6398,m426,PETER,What?
215645,L359065,u6393,m426,MAYA,When's your birthday?
215646,L359064,u6398,m426,PETER,You okay?
215647,L359061,u6398,m426,PETER,What?
215648,L359060,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Peter, let go of the chair!"
215649,L359059,u6398,m426,PETER,What's the...OH SHIT!
215650,L359058,u6393,m426,MAYA,Get up!!
215651,L359046,u6398,m426,PETER,I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
215652,L359045,u6393,m426,MAYA,Nothing yet.
215653,L359041,u6398,m426,PETER,I'm going to look around.
215654,L359040,u6393,m426,MAYA,We needed to know all we could.
215655,L359037,u6393,m426,MAYA,The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
215656,L359036,u6398,m426,PETER,What are you looking for exactly?
215657,L359034,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Townsend, he had some of Father's books."
215658,L359033,u6398,m426,PETER,"When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  ""The time of transformation is near..."""
215659,L359032,u6393,m426,MAYA,I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
215660,L359031,u6398,m426,PETER,"And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?"
215661,L359030,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry."
215662,L359029,u6393,m426,MAYA,Then why are you here?
215663,L359028,u6398,m426,PETER,So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
215664,L359027,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is."
215665,L359026,u6398,m426,PETER,I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
215666,L359025,u6393,m426,MAYA,Do you know your parents' blood types?
215667,L359024,u6398,m426,PETER,Yes.
215668,L359023,u6393,m426,MAYA,Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
215669,L359022,u6398,m426,PETER,So what?
215670,L359021,u6393,m426,MAYA,The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
215671,L359020,u6398,m426,PETER,"Yes, I know."
215672,L359019,u6393,m426,MAYA,"You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie."
215673,L359018,u6398,m426,PETER,But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
215674,L359017,u6393,m426,MAYA,"There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith..."
215675,L359016,u6398,m426,PETER,I don't understand what's going on.
215676,L358967,u6398,m426,PETER,If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
215677,L358966,u6393,m426,MAYA,You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
215678,L358965,u6398,m426,PETER,My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
215679,L358964,u6393,m426,MAYA,I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
215680,L358963,u6398,m426,PETER,I'm not going to be drawn into this.
215681,L358962,u6393,m426,MAYA,You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
215682,L358961,u6398,m426,PETER,You should think about getting professional help.
215683,L358960,u6393,m426,MAYA,The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
215684,L358959,u6398,m426,PETER,Trick him.
215685,L358958,u6393,m426,MAYA,"If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him."
215686,L358957,u6398,m426,PETER,Why didn't Birdson just say so?
215687,L358956,u6393,m426,MAYA,"It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name."
215688,L358955,u6398,m426,PETER,What?!?!
215689,L358954,u6393,m426,MAYA,"At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter."
215690,L358953,u6398,m426,PETER,And the point is?
215691,L358952,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too."
215692,L358951,u6398,m426,PETER,Why did he try to kill me?
215693,L358950,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Please, the children."
215694,L358949,u6398,m426,PETER,Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
215695,L358945,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Peter, please..."
215696,L358944,u6398,m426,PETER,We need to talk.
215697,L358859,u6398,m426,PETER,"Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?"
215698,L358858,u6393,m426,MAYA,That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
215699,L358857,u6398,m426,PETER,And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
215700,L358856,u6393,m426,MAYA,I had to.
215701,L358855,u6398,m426,PETER,Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
215702,L358828,u6393,m426,MAYA,You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
215703,L358827,u6398,m426,PETER,So what'd I miss?
215704,L358826,u6398,m426,PETER,I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
215705,L358825,u6393,m426,MAYA,You're sure?  There was nothing?
215706,L358824,u6398,m426,PETER,It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
215707,L358823,u6393,m426,MAYA,What do you mean?
215708,L358822,u6398,m426,PETER,I think you gave me the wrong one.
215709,L358821,u6393,m426,MAYA,So...what did you think of the tape.
215710,L358769,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him."
215711,L358768,u6398,m426,PETER,The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
215712,L358767,u6393,m426,MAYA,"On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?"
215713,L358766,u6398,m426,PETER,I'll bet.
215714,L358765,u6393,m426,MAYA,"An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing."
215715,L358764,u6398,m426,PETER,I do.
215716,L358763,u6393,m426,MAYA,Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
215717,L358762,u6398,m426,PETER,What's that got to do with you?
215718,L358761,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?"
215719,L358760,u6398,m426,PETER,"Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?"
215720,L358759,u6393,m426,MAYA,"In the end, the jury saw it my way."
215721,L358758,u6398,m426,PETER,Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
215722,L358757,u6393,m426,MAYA,"I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday."
215723,L358756,u6398,m426,PETER,"Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible."
215724,L358755,u6393,m426,MAYA,"And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist."
215725,L358754,u6398,m426,PETER,A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
215726,L358753,u6393,m426,MAYA,What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
215727,L358752,u6398,m426,PETER,"Not the most popular opinion, but yes."
215728,L358751,u6393,m426,MAYA,"That there is no such thing as evil with a capital ""E."""
215729,L358750,u6398,m426,PETER,"Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late."
215730,L358749,u6393,m426,MAYA,And also that...
215731,L358748,u6398,m426,PETER,Not pure evil.  That's correct.
215732,L358747,u6393,m426,MAYA,You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
215733,L358746,u6398,m426,PETER,Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
215734,L358745,u6393,m426,MAYA,I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
215735,L358744,u6398,m426,PETER,Yes... and you are?
215736,L358743,u6393,m426,MAYA,Peter Kelson?
215737,L358742,u6398,m426,PETER,May I help you?
215738,L358643,u6398,m426,PETER,"...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact."
215739,L358642,u6393,m426,MAYA,Oh my God!
215740,L358707,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,I'm not waiting until it's too late.
215741,L358706,u6393,m426,MAYA,"Look, John, I'm facing it."
215742,L358705,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,You don't want to face it.
215743,L358704,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,Sure of what?  Who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle?  Results are what Lareaux would want.
215744,L358703,u6393,m426,MAYA,You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
215745,L358702,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,It's useless...look at him.
215746,L358680,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,"Alright, Maya.  We'll do it your way."
215747,L358679,u6393,m426,MAYA,We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
215748,L358678,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,"I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us."
215749,L358677,u6393,m426,MAYA,We need all the help we can get.
215750,L358676,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,A lot of good that'll do.
215751,L358675,u6393,m426,MAYA,I've filed a report with Father Frank.
215752,L358674,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,And what are you thinking we should do now?
215753,L358647,u6393,m426,MAYA,I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
215754,L358646,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,Maya?  What do you mean?
215755,L358645,u6393,m426,MAYA,I know who he is.
215756,L358644,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,Hello?
215757,L358545,u6402,m426,TOWNSEND,Whish the circumstances were different.
215758,L358544,u6393,m426,MAYA,Good seeing you again.
215759,L359009,u6394,m426,MELVIN,Goodbye.
215760,L359008,u6398,m426,PETER,Get out of here.
215761,L359007,u6394,m426,MELVIN,"You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil."
215762,L359006,u6394,m426,MELVIN,Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
215763,L359005,u6398,m426,PETER,You know what?  You can go.
215764,L359004,u6394,m426,MELVIN,Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
215765,L359003,u6398,m426,PETER,Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
215766,L359002,u6394,m426,MELVIN,But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
215767,L359000,u6394,m426,MELVIN,You are the younger of two...
215768,L358999,u6398,m426,PETER,I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
215769,L358586,u6395,m426,MICHAEL,Nice suit.
215770,L358585,u6398,m426,PETER,"I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me."
215771,L358584,u6395,m426,MICHAEL,The police used him as a witness in this case.
215772,L358583,u6398,m426,PETER,I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
215773,L358582,u6395,m426,MICHAEL,He can see you Thursday.
215774,L358581,u6398,m426,PETER,"What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?"
215775,L358580,u6395,m426,MICHAEL,"Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism."
215776,L358997,u6398,m426,PETER,We millionaires yet?
215777,L358996,u6397,m426,MRS. QUINTANA,Good of you to stop by.
215778,L358920,u6397,m426,MRS. QUINTANA,It's Detective Smythe.
215779,L358919,u6398,m426,PETER,Yeah.
215780,L358739,u6397,m426,MRS. QUINTANA,"You watch.  One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  I'll have more money than God."
215781,L358738,u6398,m426,PETER,You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
215782,L358737,u6397,m426,MRS. QUINTANA,Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
215783,L358736,u6398,m426,PETER,Lemme guess.  The lottery.
215784,L358735,u6397,m426,MRS. QUINTANA,I plan to.  You want a tip?
215785,L358619,u6398,m426,PETER,Of course.
215786,L358618,u6400,m426,SALLY,Would you sign it for me?
215787,L358611,u6400,m426,SALLY,And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
215788,L358610,u6398,m426,PETER,"Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay."
215789,L358609,u6400,m426,SALLY,"Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God."
215790,L358608,u6398,m426,PETER,"Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority."
215791,L358607,u6400,m426,SALLY,Are you saying he's legally sane?
215792,L358606,u6398,m426,PETER,"Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed."
215793,L358605,u6400,m426,SALLY,What do you mean by that?
215794,L358604,u6398,m426,PETER,"As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism."
215795,L358603,u6400,m426,SALLY,"Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?"
215796,L358602,u6398,m426,PETER,There weren't any voices.
215797,L358601,u6400,m426,SALLY,"You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by ""demonic voices?"""
215798,L358600,u6398,m426,PETER,"No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital ""E.""  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings."
215799,L358599,u6400,m426,SALLY,"It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes."
215800,L358598,u6398,m426,PETER,"Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak."
215801,L358597,u6400,m426,SALLY,"Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?"
215802,L358596,u6398,m426,PETER,"Thanks for having me, Sally."
215803,L358595,u6400,m426,SALLY,"As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter."
215804,L358937,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't."
215805,L358936,u6398,m426,PETER,Where is she now?
215806,L358935,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism."
215807,L358934,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since."
215808,L358933,u6398,m426,PETER,She told me she killed them.
215809,L358932,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion."
215810,L358931,u6398,m426,PETER,What happened?
215811,L358930,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"Yeah, murder-suicide."
215812,L358929,u6398,m426,PETER,Parents died?
215813,L358928,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
215814,L358927,u6398,m426,PETER,She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
215815,L358924,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk."
215816,L358923,u6398,m426,PETER,It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
215817,L358922,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,How're you doin' today?
215818,L358921,u6398,m426,PETER,What's up?
215819,L358885,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you."
215820,L358884,u6398,m426,PETER,Thanks again for everything.
215821,L358881,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you."
215822,L358880,u6398,m426,PETER,Thanks for handling this.
215823,L358813,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"I'll quit, maybe you should start."
215824,L358812,u6398,m426,PETER,He could see me.
215825,L358811,u6398,m426,PETER,He's looking right at me.
215826,L358810,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,What's the matter with you?
215827,L358806,u6398,m426,PETER,You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
215828,L358805,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back."
215829,L358804,u6398,m426,PETER,Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
215830,L358594,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
215831,L358593,u6398,m426,PETER,What's this?
215832,L358592,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?"
215833,L358591,u6398,m426,PETER,"Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things."
215834,L358590,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem."
215835,L358589,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,"Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show."
215836,L358588,u6398,m426,PETER,"Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call..."
215837,L358587,u6401,m426,SMYTHE,Hey!  Mr. big shot.
215838,L360177,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you."
215839,L360176,u6410,m427,MONICA,What are you talking about?
215840,L360109,u6410,m427,MONICA,"It mattered, Mom."
215841,L360108,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
215842,L360107,u6410,m427,MONICA,That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
215843,L360103,u6410,m427,MONICA,What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
215844,L360102,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,That's ridiculous.
215845,L360101,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that."
215846,L360100,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,I don't remember that.
215847,L360099,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge."
215848,L360098,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
215849,L360097,u6410,m427,MONICA,That's not it.
215850,L360096,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife."
215851,L360095,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart."
215852,L360094,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
215853,L360093,u6410,m427,MONICA,Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
215854,L360092,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
215855,L360091,u6410,m427,MONICA,I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
215856,L360090,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say."
215857,L360089,u6410,m427,MONICA,No I don't.
215858,L360088,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
215859,L360087,u6410,m427,MONICA,"So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a ""dumb"" jump shot?"
215860,L360086,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too ""prissy"" for you, too bad."
215861,L360085,u6410,m427,MONICA,There you go.
215862,L360084,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Don't curse.
215863,L360083,u6410,m427,MONICA,I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
215864,L360082,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?"
215865,L360081,u6410,m427,MONICA,Whatever.
215866,L360080,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
215867,L360079,u6410,m427,MONICA,So what do I do?
215868,L360077,u6410,m427,MONICA,Maybe she is.
215869,L360076,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
215870,L360075,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Yeah, you met her?"
215871,L360074,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,To that stewardess?
215872,L360073,u6410,m427,MONICA,Engaged.
215873,L360072,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,How is he?
215874,L360071,u6410,m427,MONICA,Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
215875,L360070,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,I can manage.
215876,L360069,u6410,m427,MONICA,Need any help?
215877,L360068,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Hi.
215878,L359922,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game."
215879,L359921,u6410,m427,MONICA,What?
215880,L359918,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,He's still at the bank.
215881,L359917,u6410,m427,MONICA,Dad around?
215882,L359916,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
215883,L359915,u6410,m427,MONICA,Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
215884,L359914,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Monica.  What are you doing here?
215885,L359558,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?"
215886,L359557,u6410,m427,MONICA,What?
215887,L359548,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Nothing.  So good luck.
215888,L359547,u6410,m427,MONICA,What?
215889,L359546,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
215890,L359545,u6410,m427,MONICA,You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
215891,L359544,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Child, take a bite."
215892,L359543,u6410,m427,MONICA,I can't eat before a game.
215893,L359542,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Taste this.
215894,L359400,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Watch your mouth.
215895,L359399,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron..."
215896,L359398,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,That's not funny
215897,L359397,u6410,m427,MONICA,I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
215898,L359396,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
215899,L359395,u6410,m427,MONICA,nothing.
215900,L359342,u6410,m427,MONICA,Pants.
215901,L359341,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?"
215902,L359340,u6410,m427,MONICA,I hate it.
215903,L359339,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
215904,L359338,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Ah, Mom."
215905,L359332,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Oh, all that work."
215906,L359331,u6410,m427,MONICA,Nothing.
215907,L359330,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Monica, what did you do?"
215908,L359350,u6411,m427,NATHAN,"Thanks, sweetheart."
215909,L359349,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Okay.
215910,L359348,u6411,m427,NATHAN,You sure?
215911,L359347,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,The blue.
215912,L359346,u6411,m427,NATHAN,Which one for tomorrow?
215913,L359272,u6411,m427,NATHAN,"Camille, she'll be fine."
215914,L359271,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,How is she alright looking the way she does?
215915,L359270,u6411,m427,NATHAN,She's alright.
215916,L359269,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
215917,L360173,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Okay.
215918,L360172,u6409,m427,LENA,He's fine.
215919,L360171,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold."
215920,L360170,u6409,m427,LENA,"The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat."
215921,L360169,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,So you're still breast-feeding?
215922,L359394,u6409,m427,LENA,What'd you do?
215923,L359393,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
215924,L359387,u6409,m427,LENA,But you use potato?
215925,L359386,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour."
215926,L359345,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
215927,L359344,u6409,m427,LENA,Are you okay?
215928,L359343,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
215929,L359305,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Really?  Well, come on, then."
215930,L359304,u6412,m427,NONA,"You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house."
215931,L359303,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about."
215932,L359302,u6412,m427,NONA,You're a caterer?
215933,L359301,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta."
215934,L359300,u6412,m427,NONA,It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
215935,L359299,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,"Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you."
215936,L359298,u6412,m427,NONA,Okay?
215937,L359297,u6404,m427,CAMILLE,Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
215938,L359296,u6412,m427,NONA,"...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then..."
215939,L359820,u6405,m427,COACH MILLER,"You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed."
215940,L359819,u6410,m427,MONICA,It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
215941,L359818,u6405,m427,COACH MILLER,What?
215942,L359816,u6405,m427,COACH MILLER,You want the job or not?
215943,L359815,u6410,m427,MONICA,I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
215944,L359814,u6405,m427,COACH MILLER,"We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again."
215945,L359813,u6410,m427,MONICA,Thanks.
215946,L359812,u6405,m427,COACH MILLER,You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
215947,L359672,u6405,m427,COACH MILLER,"I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot."
215948,L359671,u6410,m427,MONICA,Coach...
215949,L359670,u6405,m427,COACH MILLER,"You love to pose so much, let's see it again."
215950,L359669,u6410,m427,MONICA,What?
215951,L359640,u6405,m427,COACH MILLER,This time get your feet set.
215952,L359639,u6410,m427,MONICA,I can take it.
215953,L359604,u6406,m427,JASON,Shh.  It's okay.
215954,L359603,u6410,m427,MONICA,Wait...
215955,L359602,u6406,m427,JASON,"Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself..."
215956,L359601,u6410,m427,MONICA,Uh-huh.
215957,L359600,u6406,m427,JASON,That was nice.
215958,L359586,u6406,m427,JASON,Then I'll get you some punch.
215959,L359585,u6410,m427,MONICA,My mouth is kinda dry.
215960,L359584,u6406,m427,JASON,"I mean, I'm having a good time with you..."
215961,L359583,u6410,m427,MONICA,Sorry.
215962,L359582,u6406,m427,JASON,That was two words.
215963,L359581,u6410,m427,MONICA,Huh?
215964,L359580,u6406,m427,JASON,Careful.
215965,L359579,u6410,m427,MONICA,Sort of.
215966,L359578,u6406,m427,JASON,I'm an English major.  You like English?
215967,L359564,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Oh, sorry."
215968,L359563,u6406,m427,JASON,"No, I mean I can check it for you."
215969,L359562,u6410,m427,MONICA,You're cold?
215970,L359561,u6406,m427,JASON,Can I take your coat?
215971,L359426,u6416,m427,ZEKE,I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
215972,L359425,u6407,m427,JIM,"But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did."
215973,L359424,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Gotta wait til the press conference.
215974,L359423,u6407,m427,JIM,You could make a career by telling me where.
215975,L359422,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball."
215976,L359421,u6407,m427,JIM,"Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA."
215977,L360127,u6408,m427,KYRA,"Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on."
215978,L360126,u6413,m427,QUINCY,A horse?
215979,L360125,u6408,m427,KYRA,"You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse."
215980,L360124,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I don't know sometimes.
215981,L360123,u6408,m427,KYRA,To do what you love.
215982,L360122,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?"
215983,L360121,u6408,m427,KYRA,"Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it."
215984,L360120,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You might be the only one with a job.
215985,L360119,u6408,m427,KYRA,Why not?
215986,L360118,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Nah.
215987,L360117,u6408,m427,KYRA,Four days.
215988,L360116,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So how long is this trip?
215989,L360114,u6408,m427,KYRA,"Get used to it, babe."
215990,L360113,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I don't wanna see that.
215991,L360112,u6408,m427,KYRA,What?
215992,L360111,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Damn, girl."
215993,L360065,u6408,m427,KYRA,"Yes, we appreciate that."
215994,L360064,u6413,m427,QUINCY,It means a lot that you came by.
215995,L360059,u6408,m427,KYRA,"Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you."
215996,L360058,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh..."
215997,L360057,u6408,m427,KYRA,Hello.
215998,L360055,u6408,m427,KYRA,Why are you up?  Get in bed.
215999,L360054,u6413,m427,QUINCY,It's okay.
216000,L360053,u6408,m427,KYRA,I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
216001,L359539,u6409,m427,LENA,"Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?"
216002,L359538,u6410,m427,MONICA,They ever love you back?
216003,L359537,u6409,m427,LENA,Too many times.
216004,L359536,u6410,m427,MONICA,You ever been in love?
216005,L359535,u6409,m427,LENA,Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
216006,L359534,u6410,m427,MONICA,I don't know how to walk in heels.
216007,L359533,u6409,m427,LENA,If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
216008,L359532,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Yeah, right."
216009,L359531,u6409,m427,LENA,You do.
216010,L359530,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Oh, great."
216011,L359529,u6409,m427,LENA,I told him you looked like me.
216012,L359528,u6410,m427,MONICA,How'd you get him to say yes?
216013,L359527,u6409,m427,LENA,"And he's fine, girl."
216014,L359526,u6410,m427,MONICA,He's in college?
216015,L359525,u6409,m427,LENA,This brother from my college.
216016,L359524,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Damn, Lena...  Who is he?"
216017,L359523,u6409,m427,LENA,No.
216018,L359522,u6410,m427,MONICA,Mom tell you to do this?
216019,L359521,u6409,m427,LENA,I know...
216020,L359520,u6410,m427,MONICA,Found?  I'm not some charity case.
216021,L359519,u6409,m427,LENA,I found you someone.
216022,L359518,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker."
216023,L359517,u6409,m427,LENA,So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
216024,L359515,u6409,m427,LENA,"Just try and chill a little bit, alright."
216025,L359514,u6410,m427,MONICA,No one's forcing her.
216026,L359513,u6409,m427,LENA,"You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind."
216027,L359512,u6410,m427,MONICA,Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
216028,L359511,u6409,m427,LENA,Like you don't give her a hard time.
216029,L359510,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Always on my ass, anyway."
216030,L359509,u6409,m427,LENA,Mom's going to hate it.
216031,L359508,u6410,m427,MONICA,No.
216032,L359507,u6409,m427,LENA,That too tight?
216033,L360136,u6411,m427,NATHAN,I'll take that as a compliment.
216034,L360135,u6410,m427,MONICA,You shoot like a girl.
216035,L360132,u6411,m427,NATHAN,So how's the job going?
216036,L360131,u6410,m427,MONICA,That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
216037,L360130,u6411,m427,NATHAN,I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
216038,L360129,u6410,m427,MONICA,Dad.  What are you doing here?
216039,L360128,u6411,m427,NATHAN,"Hey, munchkin."
216040,L359406,u6410,m427,MONICA,Chances are there's still a chance.
216041,L359405,u6411,m427,NATHAN,I know.  But chances are...
216042,L359404,u6410,m427,MONICA,The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
216043,L359403,u6411,m427,NATHAN,"You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality."
216044,L359402,u6410,m427,MONICA,What?
216045,L359401,u6411,m427,NATHAN,"Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball."
216046,L359392,u6410,m427,MONICA,I was just showing emotion.
216047,L359391,u6411,m427,NATHAN,You lost your head.
216048,L359390,u6410,m427,MONICA,The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
216049,L359389,u6411,m427,NATHAN,And what am I supposed to say to the man?
216050,L359388,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me."
216051,L359987,u6415,m427,SIDRA,"Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this."
216052,L359986,u6410,m427,MONICA,You ever think about going back?
216053,L359985,u6415,m427,SIDRA,"Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me."
216054,L359984,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Just not my type, I guess."
216055,L359983,u6415,m427,SIDRA,What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
216056,L359982,u6410,m427,MONICA,I wouldn't know.
216057,L359981,u6415,m427,SIDRA,So what are these Spanish guys like?
216058,L359979,u6415,m427,SIDRA,"It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad ""The American"" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball."
216059,L359978,u6410,m427,MONICA,How's that been?
216060,L359977,u6415,m427,SIDRA,Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
216061,L359976,u6410,m427,MONICA,Just like that?
216062,L359975,u6415,m427,SIDRA,"Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me."
216063,L359972,u6410,m427,MONICA,You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
216064,L359971,u6415,m427,SIDRA,Can you take that damn thing off the table.
216065,L359970,u6410,m427,MONICA,"How do you say ""you're dreaming"" in Italian?"
216066,L359969,u6415,m427,SIDRA,I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
216067,L359968,u6410,m427,MONICA,"What's up, Sidra."
216068,L359967,u6415,m427,SIDRA,"Well, what do you know."
216069,L359860,u6415,m427,SIDRA,Never let a freshman take your spot.
216070,L359859,u6410,m427,MONICA,What's that?
216071,L359858,u6415,m427,SIDRA,Just one word of advice for next season.
216072,L359857,u6410,m427,MONICA,I know.
216073,L359856,u6415,m427,SIDRA,"But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock."
216074,L359855,u6410,m427,MONICA,Thanks.
216075,L359854,u6415,m427,SIDRA,No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
216076,L359853,u6410,m427,MONICA,But?
216077,L359852,u6415,m427,SIDRA,Just wanted to say good game.
216078,L359851,u6410,m427,MONICA,What's up?
216079,L359682,u6410,m427,MONICA,Didn't have to try very hard.
216080,L359681,u6415,m427,SIDRA,You were trying to make me look bad.
216081,L359680,u6410,m427,MONICA,I was just playing ball.
216082,L359679,u6415,m427,SIDRA,"That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman."
216083,L359647,u6415,m427,SIDRA,Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
216084,L359646,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Thanks, Sidra."
216085,L359645,u6415,m427,SIDRA,"Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?"
216086,L359644,u6410,m427,MONICA,What's up with that?
216087,L359643,u6415,m427,SIDRA,She hates all freshmen.
216088,L359642,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Coach hates me, doesn't she?"
216089,L360211,u6410,m427,MONICA,"If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present."
216090,L360210,u6413,m427,QUINCY,And what happens when you lose?
216091,L360209,u6410,m427,MONICA,"So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you."
216092,L360208,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So?
216093,L360207,u6410,m427,MONICA,You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
216094,L360206,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What will this prove?
216095,L360204,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on."
216096,L360203,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you."
216097,L360202,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"What's that supposed to be, psychology?"
216098,L360201,u6410,m427,MONICA,So you're gonna bitch up?
216099,L360200,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You're out of your mind.
216100,L360199,u6410,m427,MONICA,Your heart.
216101,L360198,u6413,m427,QUINCY,For what?
216102,L360197,u6410,m427,MONICA,One game.  One-on-one.
216103,L360196,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What?
216104,L360195,u6410,m427,MONICA,I'll play you.
216105,L360194,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Wrong.
216106,L360193,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Better late than never, right?"
216107,L360192,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
216108,L360191,u6410,m427,MONICA,Then why are you so upset?
216109,L360190,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't."
216110,L360189,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago."
216111,L360188,u6413,m427,QUINCY,We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
216112,L360187,u6410,m427,MONICA,"What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away."
216113,L360186,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I heard enough.
216114,L360185,u6410,m427,MONICA,It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
216115,L360184,u6413,m427,QUINCY,you woke me up to tell me that?
216116,L360183,u6410,m427,MONICA,From basketball.
216117,L360182,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What?
216118,L360181,u6410,m427,MONICA,You asked me what was missing.
216119,L360179,u6410,m427,MONICA,We need to talk.
216120,L360178,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What's going on?
216121,L360168,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Find.
216122,L360167,u6410,m427,MONICA,"It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone."
216123,L360166,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What?
216124,L360165,u6410,m427,MONICA,Something was just missing.
216125,L360164,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Cause I don't get it.
216126,L360163,u6410,m427,MONICA,Why do you keep asking me that?
216127,L360162,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So why'd you give up ball?
216128,L360161,u6410,m427,MONICA,"It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way."
216129,L360160,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking."
216130,L360159,u6410,m427,MONICA,Wow.
216131,L360158,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Maybe go back to school.
216132,L360157,u6410,m427,MONICA,Like what?
216133,L360156,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else."
216134,L360155,u6410,m427,MONICA,You're serious.
216135,L360154,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that..."
216136,L360153,u6410,m427,MONICA,And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
216137,L360152,u6413,m427,QUINCY,That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
216138,L360151,u6410,m427,MONICA,"You had a rough couple years, that's all."
216139,L360150,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too."
216140,L360149,u6410,m427,MONICA,It just isn't.
216141,L360147,u6410,m427,MONICA,"That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy."
216142,L360146,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you..."
216143,L360145,u6410,m427,MONICA,Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
216144,L360144,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Getting there.
216145,L360143,u6410,m427,MONICA,So...how's the knee?
216146,L360142,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny."
216147,L360141,u6410,m427,MONICA,Who's this guy I always see her around?
216148,L360140,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
216149,L360139,u6410,m427,MONICA,You visiting?
216150,L360067,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Thanks.
216151,L360066,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything."
216152,L360051,u6413,m427,QUINCY,No.
216153,L360050,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?"
216154,L360049,u6413,m427,QUINCY,A rest?
216155,L360048,u6410,m427,MONICA,I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
216156,L360047,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What do you mean?
216157,L360046,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Actually, I don't..."
216158,L360045,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Figured it was something like that.
216159,L360044,u6410,m427,MONICA,Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
216160,L360043,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again."
216161,L360042,u6410,m427,MONICA,Oh yeah?
216162,L360041,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Tried calling you a couple times.
216163,L360040,u6410,m427,MONICA,Kiss my ass.
216164,L360039,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Funny.  I never did.
216165,L360038,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical."
216166,L360037,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
216167,L360036,u6410,m427,MONICA,We won the championship.
216168,L360035,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"So, how's pro-ball, Europe?"
216169,L360034,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I forgot, ""Q-man."""
216170,L360033,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Not for Quincy McCall.
216171,L360032,u6410,m427,MONICA,I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
216172,L360031,u6413,m427,QUINCY,A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
216173,L360030,u6410,m427,MONICA,What are the doctors saying?
216174,L360029,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Yup.
216175,L360028,u6410,m427,MONICA,I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
216176,L360027,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I'm alright.  But you can sit.
216177,L360026,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Shouldn't you be lying down, or..."
216178,L360025,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Thanks.
216179,L360024,u6410,m427,MONICA,"No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool."
216180,L360023,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Just something I'm trying.
216181,L360022,u6410,m427,MONICA,I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
216182,L360021,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
216183,L359956,u6410,m427,MONICA,Uh huh.
216184,L359955,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So...I guess I'll see you around.
216185,L359953,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me."
216186,L359952,u6410,m427,MONICA,"So that's it, just forget about us?"
216187,L359951,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Few days ago.
216188,L359950,u6410,m427,MONICA,When did you decide all this?
216189,L359949,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?"
216190,L359948,u6410,m427,MONICA,You're what?
216191,L359947,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Look, I'm entering the draft."
216192,L359946,u6410,m427,MONICA,You don't think so?
216193,L359945,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I don't think so.
216194,L359944,u6410,m427,MONICA,"How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this."
216195,L359943,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for."
216196,L359942,u6410,m427,MONICA,What?
216197,L359941,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I'm not asking for us to be together.
216198,L359940,u6410,m427,MONICA,"How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you."
216199,L359939,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale."
216200,L359938,u6410,m427,MONICA,I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
216201,L359937,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Never had to.
216202,L359936,u6410,m427,MONICA,I never asked you to choose.
216203,L359935,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Least you got your priorities straight.
216204,L359934,u6410,m427,MONICA,"If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!"
216205,L359933,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Stay!
216206,L359932,u6410,m427,MONICA,That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
216207,L359931,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You forgot to be there.
216208,L359930,u6410,m427,MONICA,"What, ""Q-man"", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?"
216209,L359929,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
216210,L359928,u6410,m427,MONICA,So you fucked around to prove a point!
216211,L359927,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Least she had time for me.
216212,L359926,u6410,m427,MONICA,Cheap date.
216213,L359925,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I just took the ho to Burger King, alright."
216214,L359924,u6410,m427,MONICA,Talk to your new girlfriend.
216215,L359923,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Can we talk?
216216,L359911,u6410,m427,MONICA,Are you out of your mind?
216217,L359910,u6413,m427,QUINCY,We're going to get some food.
216218,L359909,u6410,m427,MONICA,What the hell's going on?
216219,L359908,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry."
216220,L359905,u6410,m427,MONICA,Woman...
216221,L359904,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"The ""man"" again."
216222,L359903,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer."
216223,L359902,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy."
216224,L359901,u6410,m427,MONICA,You weren't at my game.
216225,L359900,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Hey, what's up."
216226,L359899,u6410,m427,MONICA,Hey.
216227,L359878,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Nah.  I have curfew.
216228,L359877,u6410,m427,MONICA,Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
216229,L359876,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"You know what, I'm just gonna crash."
216230,L359873,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Not really.
216231,L359872,u6410,m427,MONICA,You want to go talk?
216232,L359871,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?"
216233,L359870,u6410,m427,MONICA,Who's nobody?
216234,L359869,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Nobody.
216235,L359868,u6410,m427,MONICA,Who was that?
216236,L359846,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
216237,L359845,u6410,m427,MONICA,"he's just playing, Q..."
216238,L359835,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"It happens, right..."
216239,L359834,u6410,m427,MONICA,Sorry about your game.
216240,L359833,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Here I am.
216241,L359832,u6410,m427,MONICA,I've been trying to find you all day.
216242,L359831,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What's up?
216243,L359830,u6410,m427,MONICA,Hey.
216244,L359785,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"For real.  I should be alone, anyway."
216245,L359784,u6410,m427,MONICA,Quincy...
216246,L359783,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Nah.  Don't sweat it.
216247,L359782,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I mean, I can stay a few more minutes."
216248,L359781,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
216249,L359780,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up."
216250,L359779,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Why not?
216251,L359778,u6410,m427,MONICA,I...can't.
216252,L359777,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?"
216253,L359776,u6410,m427,MONICA,Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
216254,L359775,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this..."
216255,L359774,u6410,m427,MONICA,You're not stupid.
216256,L359773,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"He even had me wanting to play for the ""Clippers.""  Man, how stupid am I."
216257,L359772,u6410,m427,MONICA,She understands.
216258,L359771,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense..."
216259,L359770,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you."
216260,L359769,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something..."
216261,L359714,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I wanted you to.
216262,L359713,u6410,m427,MONICA,I won.
216263,L359712,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Right here.
216264,L359711,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Yo, where's the ""D""?"
216265,L359708,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Plan to.
216266,L359707,u6410,m427,MONICA,Kiss my booty.
216267,L359706,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"My court, I go first."
216268,L359705,u6410,m427,MONICA,Give me the ball.
216269,L359703,u6410,m427,MONICA,What?
216270,L359702,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Clothes.
216271,L359701,u6410,m427,MONICA,What are we playing for?
216272,L359700,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So how about a little one-on-one?
216273,L359698,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
216274,L359697,u6410,m427,MONICA,That was so weak.
216275,L359694,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So you're gonna act salty all night?
216276,L359693,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me."
216277,L359692,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Then prove her wrong.
216278,L359691,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me."
216279,L359690,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Forget Tonya Randall.
216280,L359663,u6410,m427,MONICA,Quit.
216281,L359662,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"It's okay, little baby."
216282,L359661,u6410,m427,MONICA,I said fine.
216283,L359660,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I can't help girls coming up to me.
216284,L359659,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Fine, Quincy."
216285,L359658,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I can't be nice to a fan?
216286,L359657,u6410,m427,MONICA,"You do see me standing here, right?"
216287,L359656,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What?
216288,L359652,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Whatever, big head."
216289,L359651,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all."
216290,L359650,u6410,m427,MONICA,What'd it say?
216291,L359649,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Yeah.
216292,L359648,u6410,m427,MONICA,You finish the reading for E-con?
216293,L359626,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I know, right?"
216294,L359625,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What was that about?
216295,L359623,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You sure?
216296,L359622,u6410,m427,MONICA,It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
216297,L359621,u6413,m427,QUINCY,When'd you get this?
216298,L359619,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You had four offensive rebounds.
216299,L359618,u6410,m427,MONICA,What?
216300,L359617,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Four.
216301,L359615,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
216302,L359614,u6410,m427,MONICA,Why?
216303,L359613,u6413,m427,QUINCY,That what you think?
216304,L359612,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied."
216305,L359611,u6413,m427,QUINCY,None of your business.
216306,L359610,u6410,m427,MONICA,So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
216307,L359609,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Figures.
216308,L359608,u6410,m427,MONICA,Mulholland Drive.
216309,L359607,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all."
216310,L359606,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Early night for you, isn't it?"
216311,L359594,u6410,m427,MONICA,"So you took Shawnee, huh?"
216312,L359593,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Guess not.
216313,L359592,u6410,m427,MONICA,He ain't Spalding.
216314,L359591,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?"
216315,L359590,u6410,m427,MONICA,Yeah.
216316,L359589,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You having fun?
216317,L359588,u6410,m427,MONICA,Hey.
216318,L359587,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Hey.
216319,L359571,u6410,m427,MONICA,You either.
216320,L359570,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You don't look half-bad.
216321,L359569,u6410,m427,MONICA,Yeah.
216322,L359568,u6413,m427,QUINCY,See you made it.
216323,L359475,u6410,m427,MONICA,Good.
216324,L359474,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I don't.
216325,L359473,u6410,m427,MONICA,Didn't know you cared so much.
216326,L359472,u6413,m427,QUINCY,With a jacked-up attitude.
216327,L359471,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a ""lady"".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player."
216328,L359470,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you."
216329,L359469,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I'm warning you, don't tempt me."
216330,L359468,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head."
216331,L359467,u6410,m427,MONICA,Would you watch the damn road?
216332,L359466,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"That's it, give it your best shot."
216333,L359465,u6410,m427,MONICA,When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
216334,L359464,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"God, here we go."
216335,L359463,u6410,m427,MONICA,I'm not the one who put this scar here.
216336,L359462,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Your hot-ass temper.
216337,L359461,u6410,m427,MONICA,Who said I'm not getting recruited?
216338,L359460,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"See, that's why you ain't getting recruited."
216339,L359459,u6410,m427,MONICA,Who's Spalding?
216340,L359458,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?"
216341,L359457,u6410,m427,MONICA,I don't.
216342,L359456,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Didn't know you cared so much.
216343,L359455,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything."
216344,L359454,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So she's honest.
216345,L359453,u6410,m427,MONICA,"And?  She's not saying, ""I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better,"" she's saying, ""I wanna bone."""
216346,L359452,u6413,m427,QUINCY,And?
216347,L359451,u6410,m427,MONICA,She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
216348,L359450,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me."
216349,L359448,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Big-ass titties?
216350,L359447,u6410,m427,MONICA,Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
216351,L359446,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What's that?
216352,L359445,u6410,m427,MONICA,Please.
216353,L359444,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Guess ""please"" would be a stretch."
216354,L359443,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Look, big head, I'll be at your car."
216355,L359442,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Your legs don't look broke.
216356,L359441,u6410,m427,MONICA,A ride home.
216357,L359440,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I know this.  What do you want?
216358,L359439,u6410,m427,MONICA,Way to hoop.
216359,L359373,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Shut up!
216360,L359372,u6410,m427,MONICA,"Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse."
216361,L359371,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What?
216362,L359370,u6410,m427,MONICA,You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
216363,L359369,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Man, forget you then, stupid."
216364,L359368,u6410,m427,MONICA,I don't have to do what you say.
216365,L359367,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So that means I have to ride with you.
216366,L359366,u6410,m427,MONICA,So?
216367,L359365,u6413,m427,QUINCY,My Dad always drives my Mom.
216368,L359364,u6410,m427,MONICA,I want to ride my own bike.
216369,L359363,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Five seconds.
216370,L359362,u6410,m427,MONICA,For how long?
216371,L359361,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I think we gotta kiss now.
216372,L359360,u6410,m427,MONICA,Okay.
216373,L359359,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Kay.
216374,L359358,u6410,m427,MONICA,How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
216375,L359357,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Oh.
216376,L359356,u6410,m427,MONICA,I don't like flowers.
216377,L359355,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers."
216378,L359354,u6410,m427,MONICA,What do I have to do?
216379,L359327,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali."
216380,L359326,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I'd just tell my sister, Lena."
216381,L359325,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street."
216382,L359324,u6410,m427,MONICA,I don't care.
216383,L359323,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You do act different.
216384,L359322,u6410,m427,MONICA,"One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth."
216385,L359321,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I don't know.  A lot.
216386,L359320,u6410,m427,MONICA,What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
216387,L359319,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"He's alright, but my Dad can take him."
216388,L359318,u6410,m427,MONICA,"I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic."
216389,L359317,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"My Dad plays for the ""Clippers.""  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything."
216390,L359316,u6410,m427,MONICA,He works at a bank.
216391,L359315,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Your Dad play?
216392,L359314,u6410,m427,MONICA,My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
216393,L359313,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I never knew a girl that could play.
216394,L359312,u6410,m427,MONICA,I just can.
216395,L359311,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So how come you could play basketball?
216396,L359310,u6410,m427,MONICA,Uh huh.
216397,L359309,u6413,m427,QUINCY,For real?
216398,L359308,u6410,m427,MONICA,It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
216399,L359307,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So...does it hurt?
216400,L359265,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
216401,L359264,u6410,m427,MONICA,Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
216402,L359259,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Lucky.
216403,L359258,u6410,m427,MONICA,"One, up."
216404,L359420,u6414,m427,SHAWNEE,"I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl."
216405,L359419,u6410,m427,MONICA,Give it yourself.
216406,L359418,u6414,m427,SHAWNEE,"Well, can you give him this for me?"
216407,L359417,u6410,m427,MONICA,There's so many I just can't keep track.
216408,L359416,u6414,m427,SHAWNEE,"C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?"
216409,L359415,u6410,m427,MONICA,No.
216410,L359414,u6414,m427,SHAWNEE,Your hair looks so cute like that.
216411,L359413,u6410,m427,MONICA,Hey.
216412,L359412,u6414,m427,SHAWNEE,"Hey, girl."
216413,L360000,u6412,m427,NONA,Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
216414,L359999,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
216415,L359998,u6412,m427,NONA,He tore his ACL.
216416,L359997,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Nona, please."
216417,L359996,u6412,m427,NONA,The doctor'll be back in a minute.
216418,L359995,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"What's that, not great?"
216419,L359994,u6412,m427,NONA,Not great.
216420,L359505,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Keep your voice down.
216421,L359504,u6412,m427,NONA,"Fine, then how many nights home is that?"
216422,L359503,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my ""bullshit"" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold."
216423,L359502,u6412,m427,NONA,You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
216424,L359501,u6416,m427,ZEKE,I have.
216425,L359500,u6412,m427,NONA,I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
216426,L359499,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Yeah.
216427,L359498,u6412,m427,NONA,I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
216428,L359497,u6416,m427,ZEKE,I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
216429,L359496,u6412,m427,NONA,At one in the morning?
216430,L359495,u6416,m427,ZEKE,I had some players to see and hands to shake.
216431,L359291,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us."
216432,L359290,u6412,m427,NONA,You just got back from a four game road trip.
216433,L359289,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Business folks.
216434,L359288,u6412,m427,NONA,With who?
216435,L359287,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting."
216436,L359286,u6412,m427,NONA,We should head over.
216437,L359285,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say ""shit."""
216438,L359284,u6412,m427,NONA,Zeke.
216439,L359767,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
216440,L359766,u6412,m427,NONA,Guess I should have been telling your father.
216441,L359765,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?"
216442,L359764,u6412,m427,NONA,"Quincy, please..."
216443,L359763,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"This is just about money, you know that."
216444,L359762,u6412,m427,NONA,Just...leave it alone.
216445,L359761,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family."
216446,L359760,u6412,m427,NONA,Whose truth are you talking about?
216447,L359759,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out."
216448,L359758,u6412,m427,NONA,Guess he talked to you.
216449,L359756,u6412,m427,NONA,I'm fine.
216450,L359755,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Sorry.  You okay?
216451,L359754,u6412,m427,NONA,You scared me.
216452,L359494,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I don't know, he had a meeting or something."
216453,L359493,u6412,m427,NONA,Later when?
216454,L359492,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Said he'd be home later.
216455,L359491,u6412,m427,NONA,Where's your dad?
216456,L359490,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Yup.
216457,L359489,u6412,m427,NONA,Still the man.
216458,L359488,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated."
216459,L359487,u6412,m427,NONA,How was your game?
216460,L359486,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I've been hearing you.
216461,L359485,u6412,m427,NONA,You hearing me?
216462,L359484,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Okay.
216463,L359483,u6412,m427,NONA,"I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs."
216464,L359482,u6413,m427,QUINCY,We were just studying.
216465,L359481,u6412,m427,NONA,"Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls."
216466,L359480,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What are you doing in my room?
216467,L359479,u6412,m427,NONA,I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
216468,L359478,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Uh, your earring?"
216469,L359477,u6412,m427,NONA,What is this?
216470,L359295,u6412,m427,NONA,Yeah.
216471,L359294,u6413,m427,QUINCY,We still have to go?
216472,L359293,u6412,m427,NONA,What?
216473,L360015,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something."
216474,L360014,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Yeah.
216475,L360013,u6416,m427,ZEKE,You want me to fuck off?
216476,L360012,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  ""I told you so?"""
216477,L360011,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
216478,L360010,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Good.
216479,L360009,u6416,m427,ZEKE,No.
216480,L360008,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?"
216481,L360007,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself."
216482,L360006,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Look, I'm busy."
216483,L360005,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
216484,L360004,u6413,m427,QUINCY,After five years.
216485,L360003,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Came by to check on you.
216486,L360002,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What do you want?
216487,L359897,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Always thought ""can't"" wasn't in a man's vocabulary."
216488,L359896,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this."
216489,L359895,u6413,m427,QUINCY,From your mouth.
216490,L359894,u6416,m427,ZEKE,What?
216491,L359893,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro."
216492,L359892,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you."
216493,L359891,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
216494,L359890,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage."
216495,L359889,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I ain't a damn liar.
216496,L359888,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?"
216497,L359887,u6413,m427,QUINCY,And some things should never fucking happen!
216498,L359886,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen."
216499,L359885,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Lucky kid.
216500,L359884,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father."
216501,L359883,u6413,m427,QUINCY,We ain't got nothing to talk about.
216502,L359882,u6416,m427,ZEKE,We need to talk.
216503,L359881,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Still is, so let yourself out."
216504,L359880,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Your door was unlocked.
216505,L359879,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What are you doing here?
216506,L359750,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days..."
216507,L359749,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What's Mom think?
216508,L359748,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the ""Clips.""  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me."
216509,L359747,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Why?
216510,L359746,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle."
216511,L359745,u6413,m427,QUINCY,So what are you gonna do?
216512,L359744,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true."
216513,L359743,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Sorry.
216514,L359741,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"I mean, it's not true, is it?"
216515,L359740,u6416,m427,ZEKE,I just told you.
216516,L359739,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Tell me what?
216517,L359738,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you."
216518,L359737,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What?
216519,L359736,u6416,m427,ZEKE,there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
216520,L359735,u6413,m427,QUINCY,What mess?
216521,L359734,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with."
216522,L359733,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Okay...
216523,L359732,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
216524,L359731,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You came out early.
216525,L359730,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere."
216526,L359729,u6413,m427,QUINCY,I'm also good enough to go pro.
216527,L359728,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree."
216528,L359727,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"You know, people."
216529,L359726,u6416,m427,ZEKE,What people?
216530,L359436,u6416,m427,ZEKE,Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
216531,L359435,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"You work too hard, Pop."
216532,L359434,u6416,m427,ZEKE,"Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late."
216533,L359433,u6413,m427,QUINCY,You don't wanna hurt your back.
216534,L359432,u6416,m427,ZEKE,I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
216535,L359431,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
216536,L359429,u6413,m427,QUINCY,Didn't we already have this conversation?
216537,L359428,u6416,m427,ZEKE,I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
216538,L359427,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way."
216539,L359283,u6416,m427,ZEKE,That's right.
216540,L359282,u6413,m427,QUINCY,"Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man."

216597,L362286,u6443,m428,PHIL,"I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --"
216598,L362285,u6419,m428,CHAD,Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
216599,L362244,u6443,m428,PHIL,OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....

216605,L362238,u6443,m428,PHIL,"Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?"
216606,L362237,u6419,m428,CHAD,It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
216607,L362236,u6443,m428,PHIL,"Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?"

I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you...."
216662,L362939,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,That was so great what you just said.

I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me."
216666,L362935,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,What?
216667,L362934,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,I lost my gun.

216670,L362931,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
216671,L362930,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Yeah, of course."
216672,L362929,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Can I tell you something?
216673,L362928,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Yeah.
216674,L362927,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
216675,L362926,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Well.

216679,L362869,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I'm sorry.
216680,L362868,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --"
216681,L362867,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --"
216682,L362866,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,...nothing.  I'm sorry...
216683,L362865,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I'm sorry.
216684,L362864,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,It's fine.
216685,L362863,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --"
216686,L362862,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"-- no, no, it's fine. Fine."
216687,L362861,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I'm sorry --
216688,L362860,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,You really use strong language.
216689,L362859,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,What?
216690,L362858,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Wow....huh...""...piss and shit..."""
216691,L362857,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
216692,L362856,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Let's make a deal.
216693,L362855,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
216694,L362854,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,...yeah...
216695,L362853,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something..."
216696,L362852,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,ok.
216697,L362851,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,You wanna make a deal with me?
216698,L362850,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"No, no."
216699,L362849,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,And I bet you say that to all the girls --
216700,L362848,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
216701,L362847,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Why not?
216702,L362846,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Well I don't go out very much.
216703,L362845,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,So you've done it --
216704,L362844,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --"
216705,L362843,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --"
216706,L362614,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Bye.
216707,L362613,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"Great, bye."
216708,L362612,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock."
216709,L362611,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,It's my favorite place --
216710,L362610,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?"
216711,L362609,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Billingsley's?
216712,L362608,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --"
216713,L362607,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?"
216714,L362606,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --"
216715,L362605,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Eight o'clock?
216716,L362604,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?"
216717,L362603,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?"
216718,L362602,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I thought you were flirting with me a little.
216719,L362601,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Yeah.
216720,L362600,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Really?
216721,L362599,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
216722,L362598,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
216723,L362597,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,No.
216724,L362596,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Well...is that illegal?
216725,L362595,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Please, yes."
216726,L362594,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,You wanna go on a date with me?
216727,L362593,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date."
216728,L362592,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,What is it?  Did you forget something?
216729,L362591,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"I'm sorry, Claudia."
216730,L362590,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Good bye.
216731,L362589,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Bye, bye, Claudia."
216732,L362588,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"yeah, good, ok."
216733,L362587,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Just Jim.
216734,L362586,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
216735,L362585,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?"
216736,L362584,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I'm sorry.
216737,L362583,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now."
216738,L362582,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,If you're not here for a 422 --
216739,L362581,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
216740,L362580,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
216741,L362579,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,This is my job.
216742,L362578,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --"
216743,L362577,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,What's that stand for?
216744,L362576,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically."
216745,L362535,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Thank you.
216746,L362534,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --"
216747,L362533,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"Ok, ok. I'm back."
216748,L362344,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Okey-doke.
216749,L362343,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
216750,L362342,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
216751,L362341,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,You won't.  You won't have to.
216752,L362340,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
216753,L362339,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
216754,L362338,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --"
216755,L362337,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,It's not -- what's a 422?
216756,L362336,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --"
216757,L362335,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,-- is not my boyfriend.
216758,L362334,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,The gentleman who came to the door --
216759,L362333,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I don't have a boyfriend.
216760,L362332,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Is this boyfriend bothering you?
216761,L362331,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Arlight, then.  Cheers."
216762,L362330,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Yeah.
216763,L362329,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?"
216764,L362328,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,You take cream or sugar?
216765,L362327,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia."
216766,L362326,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
216767,L362325,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"That's great, thank you."
216768,L362324,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,-- do you wanna cup?
216769,L362323,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --"
216770,L362322,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
216771,L362321,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"got some coffee brewing, huh?"
216772,L362162,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I don't have a boyfriend.
216773,L362161,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
216774,L362160,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Yeah.
216775,L362159,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,I'm a bit of a slob myself.
216776,L362158,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Yeah.
216777,L362157,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Bit messy.
216778,L362156,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,About two years ago.
216779,L362155,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,You just move in here?
216780,L362154,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,ok.
216781,L362153,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?"
216782,L362152,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,What are you lookin' for?
216783,L362151,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,It's fine.
216784,L362150,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,You mind if I check things back here?
216785,L362149,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --"
216786,L362148,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Who was it?
216787,L362147,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,No.
216788,L362146,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,You don't have a boyfriend?
216789,L362145,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,No.
216790,L362144,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Was it a boyfriend of yours?
216791,L362143,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry."
216792,L362142,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?"
216793,L362141,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,No.
216794,L362138,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?"
216795,L362137,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Yeah.
216796,L362136,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?"
216797,L362135,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I didn't realize it was that loud.
216798,L362134,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
216799,L362133,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,No.
216800,L362132,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
216801,L362131,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,"Yeah, but I don't know --"
216802,L362130,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Did you hear what I said?
216803,L362129,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,What?
216804,L362128,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
216805,L362127,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Wilson.
216806,L362121,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,I'm sorry.
216807,L362120,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?"
216808,L362119,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,For what?
216809,L362116,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,No one else in there with you?
216810,L362115,u6420,m428,CLAUDIA,Yes.

As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --"
217038,L361742,u6427,m428,DR. LANDON,"Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --"
217039,L361741,u6438,m428,LINDA,I need to sit down.
217040,L361740,u6427,m428,DR. LANDON,Do you wanna sit down?
217041,L361739,u6438,m428,LINDA,I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
217042,L361738,u6427,m428,DR. LANDON,"We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?"
217043,L361737,u6438,m428,LINDA,"-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --"
217044,L361736,u6427,m428,DR. LANDON,"If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --"
217045,L361735,u6438,m428,LINDA,Yeah.
217046,L361734,u6427,m428,DR. LANDON,Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
217047,L361733,u6438,m428,LINDA,He has Phil right now.
217048,L361732,u6427,m428,DR. LANDON,"Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --"
217049,L361731,u6438,m428,LINDA,"I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?"
217050,L361730,u6427,m428,DR. LANDON,"I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?"
217051,L361729,u6438,m428,LINDA,"-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?"

217095,L361650,u6428,m428,EARL,"She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy."
217096,L361649,u6443,m428,PHIL,She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
217097,L361648,u6428,m428,EARL,"And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?"

217099,L361646,u6428,m428,EARL,Get a girlfriend.
217100,L361645,u6443,m428,PHIL,No.

217108,L361551,u6443,m428,PHIL,How's today then?
217109,L361700,u6429,m428,FEMALE VOICE,Yep.
217110,L361699,u6443,m428,PHIL,Alright.  Thank you.
217111,L361698,u6429,m428,FEMALE VOICE,Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
217112,L361697,u6443,m428,PHIL,Is this 509-9027?
217113,L361696,u6429,m428,FEMALE VOICE,No.
217114,L361695,u6443,m428,PHIL,I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
217115,L361694,u6429,m428,FEMALE VOICE,I think you have the wrong number.
217116,L361693,u6443,m428,PHIL,Hi.  Is Frank there?
217117,L361692,u6429,m428,FEMALE VOICE,Hello?
217118,L362692,u6430,m428,FRANK,-- fuck you.
217119,L362691,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,"You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --"
217120,L362690,u6430,m428,FRANK,"You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, ""If I'd known I wouldn't have asked,"" then it's not an attack?  Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now."
217121,L362689,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,"So you sat it out, that's what you did?"
217122,L362688,u6430,m428,FRANK,Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
217123,L362630,u6430,m428,FRANK,I'm quietly judging you.
217124,L362629,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,Yeah.
217125,L362628,u6430,m428,FRANK,What am I doing?
217126,L362627,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,"C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?"
217127,L362472,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
217128,L362471,u6430,m428,FRANK,And that's what you've heard?
217129,L362470,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
217130,L362469,u6430,m428,FRANK,Go ahead and waste your time.
217131,L362468,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,"No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --"
217132,L362467,u6430,m428,FRANK,"An old stomping ground --is this the ""attack"" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is ""the girl"" coming in for the kill?"
217133,L362466,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,She lived in Tarzana.
217134,L362465,u6430,m428,FRANK,Mm. Hm.
217135,L362464,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,She does.  From when you were a boy.
217136,L362463,u6430,m428,FRANK,I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
217137,L362462,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,Do you remember a Miss Simms?
217138,L362461,u6430,m428,FRANK,I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
217139,L362460,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,"We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --"
217140,L362459,u6430,m428,FRANK,"This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- ""The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me,"" Chapter Three --"
217141,L362458,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
217142,L362457,u6430,m428,FRANK,Not really.
217143,L362456,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,It's all important --
217144,L362455,u6430,m428,FRANK,-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
217145,L362454,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,"I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --"
217146,L362453,u6430,m428,FRANK,In aid of what?
217147,L362452,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,"Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --"
217148,L362451,u6430,m428,FRANK,Yes.
217149,L362450,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,Are you asking me that?
217150,L362449,u6430,m428,FRANK,-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
217151,L362448,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,This isn't meant --
217152,L362447,u6430,m428,FRANK,"Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, ""Seduce and Destory:"" ""Facing the past is an important way in not making progress,"" that's something I tell my men over and over --"
217153,L362446,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,I would just want to clear some things up:
217154,L362445,u6430,m428,FRANK,"So boring, so useless --"
217155,L362444,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,-- just to clarify --
217156,L362443,u6430,m428,FRANK,Is that still lingering?
217157,L362442,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,I'm confused about your past is the thing.
217158,L362441,u6430,m428,FRANK,Muffy -- coffee?
217159,L362440,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,-- let's talk more about your background --
217160,L362439,u6430,m428,FRANK,I warned you -- I get on a roll...
217161,L362438,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
217162,L362437,u6430,m428,FRANK,"I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did."
217163,L362436,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,Let's talk about --
217164,L362435,u6430,m428,FRANK,"-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The ""listener-patient""  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical ""get my dick hard and fuck it"" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --"
217165,L362302,u6430,m428,FRANK,"Like I said, yeah --"
217166,L362301,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,"-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --"
217167,L362026,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,"Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --"
217168,L362025,u6430,m428,FRANK,"-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, ""Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me.""  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?"
217169,L362024,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,I'm gonna start rolling --
217170,L362023,u6430,m428,FRANK,"Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways."
217171,L362022,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,All it takes is one second?
217172,L362019,u6430,m428,FRANK,You got us a room so quick?
217173,L362018,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,"If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --"
217174,L362017,u6430,m428,FRANK,Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
217175,L362016,u6432,m428,GWENOVIER,That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
217176,L362476,u6431,m428,GWEN,Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
217177,L362475,u6430,m428,FRANK,Are you asking me a question?
217178,L362316,u6430,m428,FRANK,"I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in ""Seduce,"" And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he."
217179,L362315,u6431,m428,GWEN,Kind of.
217180,L362314,u6430,m428,FRANK,"no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?"
217181,L362313,u6431,m428,GWEN,They wouldn't?
217182,L362312,u6430,m428,FRANK,"Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --"
217183,L362311,u6431,m428,GWEN,Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
217184,L362310,u6430,m428,FRANK,"""Frank"" was my mother's father."
217185,L362309,u6431,m428,GWEN,"And ""Frank?"""
217186,L362308,u6430,m428,FRANK,"My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research."
217187,L362307,u6431,m428,GWEN,"It's not your given name, right?"
217188,L362306,u6430,m428,FRANK,What name?  My name?
217189,L362305,u6431,m428,GWEN,Where does that name come from?
217190,L362304,u6430,m428,FRANK,"I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>."
217191,L362303,u6431,m428,GWEN,"And you went to Van Nuys High, right?"

217199,L362264,u6430,m428,FRANK,Not a problem.

217211,L362252,u6430,m428,FRANK,Well I guess it doesn't.
217212,L362251,u6431,m428,GWEN,Why does that sound silly?
217213,L362250,u6430,m428,FRANK,My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
217214,L362249,u6431,m428,GWEN,And what did your parents do?

217282,L361613,u6439,m428,MARCIE,"Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?"
217283,L361612,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here."
217284,L361611,u6439,m428,MARCIE,"It's a free country, you can think anything you want."
217285,L361610,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something."
217286,L361609,u6439,m428,MARCIE,I went out last night.
217287,L361608,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?"
217288,L361605,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"What's this, how did this happen?"
217289,L361604,u6439,m428,MARCIE,I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
217290,L361603,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,And what about screaming?
217291,L361602,u6439,m428,MARCIE,I don't know a loud crash.
217292,L361601,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash."
217293,L361600,u6439,m428,MARCIE,I didn't do anything.
217294,L361599,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"I'm not askin', Marcie."
217295,L361598,u6439,m428,MARCIE,I preffer to stand.

217307,L361586,u6439,m428,MARCIE,What does it look like?
217308,L361585,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
217309,L361584,u6439,m428,MARCIE,I don't have to answer your questions.
217310,L361583,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
217311,L361582,u6439,m428,MARCIE,I AM CALM.
217312,L361581,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,"Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down."
217313,L361580,u6439,m428,MARCIE,"You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --"
217314,L361579,u6434,m428,JIM KURRING,Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
217315,L361578,u6439,m428,MARCIE,There's no disturbance.

217388,L362960,u6435,m428,JIMMY,"She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, ""You touched me wrong..."" ""I know that."" Some crazy thought in her, in her head..."
217389,L362959,u6435,m428,JIMMY,I think that she thinks I may have molested her.

217506,L362507,u6437,m428,KLIGMAN,The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
217507,L362506,u6438,m428,LINDA,What does that mean?
217508,L362505,u6437,m428,KLIGMAN,"Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --"
217509,L362504,u6438,m428,LINDA,Where will the money go?
217510,L362503,u6437,m428,KLIGMAN,"You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time."
217511,L362502,u6438,m428,LINDA,I can't.
217512,L362501,u6437,m428,KLIGMAN,Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.

I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married.

217516,L362490,u6438,m428,LINDA,"No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.

I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?"
217517,L362489,u6437,m428,KLIGMAN,You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
217518,L362488,u6438,m428,LINDA,"-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---"

217521,L362485,u6437,m428,KLIGMAN,"Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --"
217522,L362484,u6438,m428,LINDA,"If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?"
217523,L362483,u6437,m428,KLIGMAN,Are you on drugs right now?
217524,L362482,u6438,m428,LINDA,"No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --"

217665,L367512,u6453,m429,ANNE,"Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan."
217666,L367511,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
217667,L367509,u6453,m429,ANNE,Nothing... Nothing.
217668,L367508,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
217669,L367507,u6453,m429,ANNE,"If I don't kiss you, I die anyway."
217670,L367506,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death..."

217676,L367199,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"No, M'lady."
217677,L367198,u6453,m429,ANNE,And you were not hurt?
217678,L367197,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,God smiled upon us.
217679,L367196,u6453,m429,ANNE,I understand you saved my son's life today.
217680,L367195,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,M'lady...?
217681,L367817,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
217682,L367816,u6453,m429,ANNE,"No, Louis!  No!"
217683,L367815,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate."
217684,L367805,u6459,m429,LOUIS,He is nothing now.
217685,L367804,u6453,m429,ANNE,He is your brother!
217686,L367803,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"What had you to do with this, Mother?"
217687,L367802,u6459,m429,LOUIS,My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
217688,L367801,u6453,m429,ANNE,"Louis, please -- !"
217689,L367704,u6453,m429,ANNE,Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
217690,L367703,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!"
217691,L367701,u6459,m429,LOUIS,You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
217692,L367700,u6453,m429,ANNE,"Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man."
217693,L367699,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
217694,L367698,u6453,m429,ANNE,He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
217695,L367697,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you."
217696,L367696,u6453,m429,ANNE,"First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner."
217697,L367695,u6459,m429,LOUIS,He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
217698,L367694,u6453,m429,ANNE,I wish to discuss your brother.
217699,L367693,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"What is it, mother?"
217700,L367692,u6453,m429,ANNE,We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
217701,L367691,u6459,m429,LOUIS,I am preparing for a ball!
217702,L367690,u6453,m429,ANNE,May I speak with you?  Alone?
217703,L367689,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Mother -- ?
217704,L367782,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Shut up, knave!"
217705,L367781,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"D'Artagnan, arrest them all!"
217706,L367736,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
217707,L367735,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison."
217708,L367734,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Wh-- Wha--
217709,L367306,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own."
217710,L367305,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"I grow closer to my target, your Majesty."
217711,L367304,u6459,m429,LOUIS,How goes that favor I asked of you?
217712,L367303,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Your Majesty...
217713,L367138,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?"
217714,L367137,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
217715,L367136,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?"
217716,L367135,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,How can I serve you in this?
217717,L367134,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself."
217718,L367133,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty."
217719,L367132,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits."
217720,L367131,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?"
217721,L367848,u6455,m429,ATHOS,To the Bastille.  And death.
217722,L367847,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Then to the Bastille.
217723,L367843,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Perhaps he serves a different king.
217724,L367842,u6455,m429,ATHOS,So what has changed?
217725,L367841,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
217726,L367840,u6455,m429,ATHOS,You're a fool!
217727,L367839,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,He seeks redemption.
217728,L367833,u6455,m429,ATHOS,We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
217729,L367832,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Bloody hell...
217730,L367712,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Hold your goblet with two fingers.
217731,L367711,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart."
217732,L367668,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!"
217733,L367667,u6455,m429,ATHOS,But --
217734,L367666,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance."
217735,L367665,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Aramis, this will never --"
217736,L367620,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it."
217737,L367619,u6455,m429,ATHOS,But --
217738,L367618,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King."
217739,L367617,u6455,m429,ATHOS,What you're asking is impossible!
217740,L367616,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days."
217741,L367615,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --"
217742,L367614,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
217743,L367613,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Where are you going?!
217744,L367608,u6455,m429,ATHOS,All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
217745,L367607,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
217746,L367606,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Poor Phillippe!
217747,L367597,u6455,m429,ATHOS,But -- but --
217748,L367596,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity."
217749,L367595,u6455,m429,ATHOS,We must stop him!
217750,L367594,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months."
217751,L367593,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Hang himself?!
217752,L367592,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"About to hang himself, I should think."
217753,L367591,u6455,m429,ATHOS,But -- what is he doing?
217754,L367590,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Now.  You were saying?
217755,L367589,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
217756,L367588,u6455,m429,ATHOS,But -- what is Porthos doing?
217757,L367587,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Go on.
217758,L367586,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Don't play God with me, Aramis I --"
217759,L367585,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,You grow fond of him.  That's good.
217760,L367584,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --"
217761,L367580,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?"
217762,L367579,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Three days??!!
217763,L367578,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Three days.
217764,L367577,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --"
217765,L367576,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,You can do it.
217766,L367575,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --"
217767,L367574,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,More wine!!
217768,L367573,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --"
217769,L367572,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,How is he?
217770,L367555,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Yes, and he has a choice!"
217771,L367554,u6455,m429,ATHOS,It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
217772,L367553,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
217773,L367552,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"And people close to him, who --"
217774,L367551,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Those can be adopted --
217775,L367550,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --"
217776,L367549,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,I have it all worked out.
217777,L367548,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
217778,L367497,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else."
217779,L367496,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!"
217780,L367495,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy."
217781,L367494,u6455,m429,ATHOS,He who is not with us is against us.
217782,L367493,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy."
217783,L367492,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one."
217784,L367491,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth."
217785,L367490,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!"
217786,L367489,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Tomorrow.
217787,L367488,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Who is he, Aramis?"
217788,L367465,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"His plight is obvious, isn't it?"
217789,L367464,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man."
217790,L367463,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow."
217791,L367427,u6455,m429,ATHOS,I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
217792,L367426,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,A body.
217793,L367425,u6455,m429,ATHOS,What is that?
217794,L367424,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Come, we have a boat waiting."
217795,L367423,u6455,m429,ATHOS,The Prison of Belle Sur.
217796,L367422,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Soon enough.  Here we are.
217797,L367421,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?"
217798,L367419,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Making the key to the throne.
217799,L367418,u6455,m429,ATHOS,What are they doing?
217800,L367403,u6455,m429,ATHOS,I am with you!
217801,L367402,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,It can.  I know the way.
217802,L367399,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Replace the king.
217803,L367398,u6455,m429,ATHOS,What do you propose to do?
217804,L367393,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way."
217805,L367392,u6455,m429,ATHOS,And some problems cannot be settled without one.
217806,L367884,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way."
217807,L367883,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
217808,L367867,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,That doesn't matter now.
217809,L367866,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"They will know you helped us, if we go this way."
217810,L367865,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river."
217811,L367788,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!"
217812,L367787,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,Everyone back.
217813,L367786,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Pull them back!
217814,L367785,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,You can't do it.
217815,L367784,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Pull them back, d'Artagnan."
217816,L367416,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,I know.  God go with you.
217817,L367415,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
217818,L367414,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
217819,L367413,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone."
217820,L367406,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
217821,L367405,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
217822,L367404,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,No!  Stop --
217823,L367391,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
217824,L367390,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it."
217825,L367107,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
217826,L367106,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
217827,L367105,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,A simple theological discussion.
217828,L367879,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"He is right, d'Artagnan."
217829,L367878,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway."
217830,L367835,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
217831,L367834,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
217832,L367717,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
217833,L367716,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
217834,L367673,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,The Queen Mother.  Anne.
217835,L367672,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Who?
217836,L367671,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
217837,L367655,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong."
217838,L367654,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"He's going to kill you, Aramis."
217839,L367647,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Did she have tits like that?
217840,L367646,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her."
217841,L367645,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Aramis... These are... these are whores!
217842,L367642,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Come on...
217843,L367641,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
217844,L367634,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Why didn't you say so?
217845,L367633,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,We go someplace dangerous.
217846,L367632,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,What use am I?
217847,L367631,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Coming?
217848,L367604,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Well... Well... Okay.
217849,L367603,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest."
217850,L367542,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe."
217851,L367541,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,But why?
217852,L367540,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!"
217853,L367539,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --"
217854,L367538,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"No, not Louis!"
217855,L367537,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
217856,L367536,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king."
217857,L367535,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --"
217858,L367530,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,But I was on duty...
217859,L367529,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?"
217860,L367528,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born."
217861,L367526,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor."
217862,L367525,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
217863,L367467,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless."
217864,L367466,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,And why are you so glum?
217865,L367397,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France."
217866,L367396,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be."
217867,L367395,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?"
217868,L367394,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
217869,L367386,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Catacombs.  Very holy.
217870,L367385,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
217871,L367384,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,It is also a place of burial.
217872,L367383,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Mother of God!
217873,L367382,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?"
217874,L367381,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Where are we?
217875,L367380,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip."
217876,L367379,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Aramis... is this the way to hell?
217877,L367102,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!"
217878,L367101,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
217879,L367098,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Forgiveness?
217880,L367097,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,Forgiveness.
217881,L367096,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral."
217882,L367095,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,There are more important things than tits.
217883,L367094,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes."
217884,L367093,u6454,m429,ARAMIS,"Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?"
217885,L367092,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --"
217886,L367852,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!"
217887,L367851,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,It worked!
217888,L367846,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss."
217889,L367845,u6455,m429,ATHOS,You are right.  But it is a trap.
217890,L367844,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go."
217891,L367838,u6455,m429,ATHOS,He lures us to capture.
217892,L367837,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"""Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."""
217893,L367670,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"At a ball, everyone watches the King!"
217894,L367669,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"D'Artagnan, unready?"
217895,L367432,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,"I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here."
217896,L367431,u6455,m429,ATHOS,What do we do now?
217897,L367430,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
217898,L367429,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Who does?
217899,L367428,u6464,m429,PORTHOS,He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
217900,L367232,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Raoul --
217901,L367231,u6465,m429,RAOUL,"Goodbye, father.  I am sorry."
217902,L367230,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --"
217903,L367229,u6465,m429,RAOUL,"It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you."
217904,L367228,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
217905,L367227,u6465,m429,RAOUL,"I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge."
217906,L367226,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Die?  What...?
217907,L367225,u6465,m429,RAOUL,"Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that."
217908,L367224,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
217909,L367223,u6465,m429,RAOUL,"She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet."
217910,L367222,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Michelle cannot possibly accept!
217911,L367221,u6465,m429,RAOUL,"We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother."
217912,L367220,u6455,m429,ATHOS,But -- are you sure?
217913,L367219,u6465,m429,RAOUL,"Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace."
217914,L367218,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!"
217915,L367117,u6455,m429,ATHOS,She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
217916,L367116,u6465,m429,RAOUL,Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
217917,L367115,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Perhaps this will help.
217918,L367114,u6465,m429,RAOUL,I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
217919,L367113,u6455,m429,ATHOS,None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
217920,L367112,u6465,m429,RAOUL,Do I look all right?
217921,L367861,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
217922,L367860,u6455,m429,ATHOS,He lies.  He is here to trap us.
217923,L367779,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot."
217924,L367778,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen."
217925,L367410,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
217926,L367409,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!"
217927,L367408,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
217928,L367407,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!"
217929,L367353,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King."
217930,L367352,u6455,m429,ATHOS,The King killed my son!
217931,L367351,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself."
217932,L367350,u6455,m429,ATHOS,To kill the king.
217933,L367349,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,Where are you going?
217934,L367348,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Athos, I beg you --"
217935,L367347,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Get out of my way.
217936,L367346,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Athos, please...!"
217937,L367246,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Save my son, d'Artagnan."
217938,L367245,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too."
217939,L367244,u6455,m429,ATHOS,You trust his character more than anyone else does.
217940,L367243,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused."
217941,L367242,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Oh my friend.
217942,L367241,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,I know.
217943,L367240,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Raoul is everything to me.
217944,L367239,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
217945,L367238,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --"
217946,L367237,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
217947,L367236,u6455,m429,ATHOS,You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
217948,L367235,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!"
217949,L367234,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
217950,L367233,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!"
217951,L367216,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope."
217952,L367215,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,I heard your playing.
217953,L367214,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
217954,L367213,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
217955,L367212,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?"
217956,L367211,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it."
217957,L367210,u6455,m429,ATHOS,You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
217958,L367209,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Thanks, but not for me."
217959,L367208,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine."
217960,L367207,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,It's been too long.
217961,L367206,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Athos, my friend!"
217962,L367205,u6455,m429,ATHOS,D'Artagnan!
217963,L367898,u6455,m429,ATHOS,D'Artagnan...
217964,L367897,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,"All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask."
217965,L367886,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,"If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you."
217966,L367885,u6455,m429,ATHOS,One for all.  All for one.
217967,L367856,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,How did you --
217968,L367855,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Phillippe...?
217969,L367731,u6455,m429,ATHOS,She will be at the ball.
217970,L367730,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,The room of the King's favorite mistress?
217971,L367663,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Your mother's.
217972,L367662,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,Whose rooms are those?
217973,L367661,u6455,m429,ATHOS,These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
217974,L367627,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,Porthos told me.
217975,L367626,u6455,m429,ATHOS,How did you know -- ?
217976,L367625,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
217977,L367624,u6455,m429,ATHOS,No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
217978,L367623,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,"I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --"
217979,L367611,u6455,m429,ATHOS,I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
217980,L367610,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,"I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it."
217981,L367569,u6455,m429,ATHOS,I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
217982,L367568,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,What is that?
217983,L367567,u6455,m429,ATHOS,It is something I have done -- or did not do.
217984,L367566,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
217985,L367565,u6455,m429,ATHOS,"I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it."
217986,L367564,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,What is its antidote?
217987,L367563,u6455,m429,ATHOS,The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
217988,L367562,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,"There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?"
217989,L367561,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
217990,L367560,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,"Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king..."
217991,L367559,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Recent hours have been a shock.
217992,L367478,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Phillippe.  Rest now.
217993,L367477,u6460,m429,MAN IN THE IRON MASK,The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
217994,L367474,u6455,m429,ATHOS,And you never knew why?
217995,L367473,u6460,m429,MAN IN THE IRON MASK,"A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, ""What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?""  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting."
217996,L367472,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Who came?
217997,L367471,u6460,m429,MAN IN THE IRON MASK,"This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison."
217998,L367469,u6460,m429,MAN IN THE IRON MASK,Just... water.
217999,L367468,u6455,m429,ATHOS,Are you hungry?
218000,L367820,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,There.
218001,L367819,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Where is Michelle?
218002,L367811,u6459,m429,LOUIS,They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
218003,L367810,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them."
218004,L367809,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Forgive?!
218005,L367808,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother."
218006,L367807,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Get out of my way.
218007,L367806,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France."
218008,L367799,u6459,m429,LOUIS,My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
218009,L367798,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
218010,L367797,u6459,m429,LOUIS,He is my brother.
218011,L367796,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,... You knew you had a double?
218012,L367795,u6459,m429,LOUIS,I was told this impostor was dead!
218013,L367794,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Yes, your Majesty."
218014,L367793,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
218015,L367792,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"It shall be done, your Majesty."
218016,L367791,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!"
218017,L367726,u6459,m429,LOUIS,... tired.  Must... lie down.
218018,L367725,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,Your Majesty...?
218019,L367681,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan."
218020,L367680,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --"
218021,L367523,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --"
218022,L367522,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?"
218023,L367297,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Thank you, your Majesty."
218024,L367296,u6459,m429,LOUIS,I will consider it.  Now leave me.
218025,L367295,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!"
218026,L367294,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Silence!  I order you!
218027,L367293,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,At least help Raoul.
218028,L367292,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!"
218029,L367291,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --"
218030,L367290,u6459,m429,LOUIS,You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
218031,L367289,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"There is more to love than he knew, or that you know."
218032,L367288,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me."
218033,L367287,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
218034,L367286,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!"
218035,L367285,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,Your Majesty has had many women --
218036,L367284,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
218037,L367283,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love."
218038,L367282,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Betrothed?  I think not.
218039,L367281,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations."
218040,L367280,u6459,m429,LOUIS,A personal nature?
218041,L367279,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature."
218042,L367278,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow."
218043,L367277,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor."
218044,L367276,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!"
218045,L367156,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!"
218046,L367155,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
218047,L367154,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!"
218048,L367153,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
218049,L367152,u6459,m429,LOUIS,I decided it this morning.
218050,L367151,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
218051,L367150,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?"
218052,L367149,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,Your Majesty...
218053,L367893,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,I am unhurt --
218054,L367892,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,Phillippe!
218055,L367881,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son."
218056,L367880,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,"Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace."
218057,L367771,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"I must insist, Sire."
218058,L367770,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,... The ball... Continue.
218059,L367769,u6456,m429,D'ARTAGNAN,"Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me."
218060,L367768,u6462,m429,PHILLIPPE,Continue.
218061,L367187,u6460,m429,MAN IN THE IRON MASK,What was the end page?
218062,L367186,u6457,m429,KEEPER,You've... memorized...?
218063,L367185,u6460,m429,MAN IN THE IRON MASK,"Two-thirty-seven:  ""... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."""
218064,L367184,u6457,m429,KEEPER,... Two-thirty-seven.
218065,L367183,u6460,m429,MAN IN THE IRON MASK,"What number, on the first page?"
218066,L367182,u6457,m429,KEEPER,Eh?
218067,L367181,u6460,m429,MAN IN THE IRON MASK,What number did you tear out?
218068,L367177,u6460,m429,MAN IN THE IRON MASK,"Thank you, Keeper."
218069,L367176,u6457,m429,KEEPER,"Food, moron."
218070,L367085,u6460,m429,MAN IN THE IRON MASK,"No, Keeper."
218071,L367084,u6457,m429,KEEPER,You dead yet?
218072,L367888,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Shoot them!  Shoot them!
218073,L367887,u6458,m429,LIEUTENANT,Magnificent valor...
218074,L367875,u6458,m429,LIEUTENANT,The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
218075,L367874,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
218076,L367831,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me."
218077,L367830,u6458,m429,LIEUTENANT,Out directing the search for the traitors.
218078,L367829,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
218079,L367373,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
218080,L367372,u6458,m429,LIEUTENANT,"Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?"
218081,L367371,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"You may go, Lieutenant."
218082,L367370,u6458,m429,LIEUTENANT,... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
218083,L367369,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
218084,L367368,u6458,m429,LIEUTENANT,"No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front."
218085,L367367,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Did they kill him?
218086,L367366,u6458,m429,LIEUTENANT,"Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate."
218087,L367365,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Yes, yes, go on."
218088,L367364,u6458,m429,LIEUTENANT,"I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --"
218089,L367142,u6463,m429,PIERRE,"What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!"
218090,L367141,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Exactly why it should be given away.
218091,L367140,u6463,m429,PIERRE,That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
218092,L367139,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?"
218093,L367130,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do."
218094,L367129,u6463,m429,PIERRE,"Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --"
218095,L367128,u6459,m429,LOUIS,Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
218096,L367127,u6463,m429,PIERRE,"Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving."
218097,L367126,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?"
218098,L367517,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
218099,L367516,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --"
218100,L367515,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,"Raoul... Oh, Raoul..."
218101,L367378,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,"Oh Louis, Louis..."
218102,L367377,u6459,m429,LOUIS,I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
218103,L367376,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger."
218104,L367375,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,Did you know... about Raoul?
218105,L367363,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"No, you may wait behind the screen."
218106,L367362,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,Shall I leave?
218107,L367328,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin?  Where was it? Here?"
218108,L367327,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,"Sire, I --"
218109,L367326,u6459,m429,LOUIS,You are beautiful.  You know you are.
218110,L367324,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"My dear, I've already done it."
218111,L367323,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,"You would do that, your Majesty?"
218112,L367322,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them."
218113,L367321,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,I... we are humble people...
218114,L367320,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things."
218115,L367319,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,It's lovely.  It's just...
218116,L367318,u6459,m429,LOUIS,The food doesn't please you?
218117,L367317,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"Enough of this, our dinner waits."
218118,L367316,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,Raoul... is in love...
218119,L367315,u6459,m429,LOUIS,From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
218120,L367314,u6459,m429,LOUIS,A letter.  May I see?
218121,L367313,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,... Nothing.
218122,L367312,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?"
218123,L367311,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,Sire!  I -- How did you --
218124,L367169,u6459,m429,LOUIS,You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
218125,L367168,u6461,m429,MICHELLE,"Sire, I --"
218126,L367167,u6459,m429,LOUIS,"I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful."
218127,L368286,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"Yeah, stick around, you might learn something."
218128,L368285,u6466,m430,CRAIG,You mind if I ride with you?
218129,L368279,u6466,m430,CRAIG,"Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands."
218130,L368278,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again."
218131,L368266,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction."
218132,L368265,u6466,m430,CRAIG,Every step of the way.
218133,L368264,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Cooperate?
218134,L368263,u6466,m430,CRAIG,I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
218135,L368262,u6466,m430,CRAIG,"That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous."
218136,L368261,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!"
218137,L368260,u6466,m430,CRAIG,"Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large."
218138,L368259,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
218139,L368258,u6466,m430,CRAIG,"I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service."
218140,L368257,u6468,m430,DOYLE,We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
218141,L368256,u6466,m430,CRAIG,"We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years."
218142,L368254,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
218143,L368253,u6466,m430,CRAIG,Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
218144,L368252,u6468,m430,DOYLE,What can I do for you?
218145,L368250,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Yeah?
218146,L368249,u6466,m430,CRAIG,Captain Doyle?
218147,L368294,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"Alright, stay on the phone."
218148,L368293,u6467,m430,D.T.,What do you think?
218149,L368292,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,You set to go -
218150,L368291,u6467,m430,D.T.,We're by Ozone...
218151,L368290,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Where are you?
218152,L368289,u6467,m430,D.T.,Yeah?
218153,L368138,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!"
218154,L368137,u6467,m430,D.T.,You mean shut your ass down!
218155,L368136,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,So what is they have enough to shut us down!
218156,L368135,u6467,m430,D.T.,So what?
218157,L368134,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
218158,L368133,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me."
218159,L368132,u6467,m430,D.T.,What do you need?
218160,L368131,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,It's Marvosa -
218161,L368439,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
218162,L368438,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"It's just...catching up with me, you know?"
218163,L368437,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Something wrong with you Marvosa?
218164,L368434,u6468,m430,DOYLE,That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
218165,L368433,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
218166,L368429,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is."
218167,L368428,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection."
218168,L368426,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"Where do you come from, Marvosa?"
218169,L368425,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Gotta come from somewhere...
218170,L368424,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?"
218171,L368423,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,What?
218172,L368422,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Well don't you think that's odd?
218173,L368421,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
218174,L368420,u6468,m430,DOYLE,So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
218175,L368419,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Yeah...
218176,L368418,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Did you start out area six?
218177,L368417,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
218178,L368416,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work..."
218179,L368415,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,What?
218180,L368403,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
218181,L368402,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,What's this?
218182,L368284,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Fine -
218183,L368283,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,I'll take the south end -
218184,L368282,u6468,m430,DOYLE,I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
218185,L368281,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
218186,L368280,u6468,m430,DOYLE,If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
218187,L368270,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Right behind you.
218188,L368269,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Let's roll -
218189,L368244,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Fine...
218190,L368243,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Find out for me.
218191,L368241,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love..."
218192,L368240,u6468,m430,DOYLE,But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
218193,L368239,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
218194,L368238,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
218195,L368237,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,What did the six-toes have to say?
218196,L368202,u6468,m430,DOYLE,I didn't hit shit!
218197,L368201,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Did you hit him?
218198,L368125,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Don't worry -
218199,L368124,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
218200,L368122,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -"
218201,L368121,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
218202,L368120,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Great. Well that changes a lot...
218203,L368119,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
218204,L368118,u6468,m430,DOYLE,What the hell is this Marvosa!!
218205,L368099,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
218206,L368098,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!"
218207,L368097,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!"
218208,L368096,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!"
218209,L368095,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -"
218210,L368094,u6468,m430,DOYLE,What the hell happened?
218211,L368060,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!"
218212,L368059,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"You can cut the shit, asshole--"
218213,L368053,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Did you report it stolen?
218214,L368052,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Bullshit...
218215,L368572,u6469,m430,JIM,It wasn't in the cards.
218216,L368571,u6468,m430,DOYLE,I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
218217,L368570,u6469,m430,JIM,I'll live...
218218,L368569,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Are you alright?
218219,L368056,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!"
218220,L368055,u6469,m430,JIM,I didn't break in - the back door was open!
218221,L368054,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"So...  to get the car back, you break into her house."
218222,L368051,u6469,m430,JIM,She stole my car!!
218223,L368050,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
218224,L368041,u6469,m430,JIM,I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
218225,L368040,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
218226,L368039,u6469,m430,JIM,And who are you?
218227,L368038,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"Alright, where is she?"
218228,L368223,u6470,m430,LURCH,Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
218229,L368222,u6468,m430,DOYLE,And what did he do to the girl?
218230,L368221,u6470,m430,LURCH,I was just having a little fun -
218231,L368219,u6470,m430,LURCH,"Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?"
218232,L368218,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!"
218233,L368217,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
218234,L368216,u6470,m430,LURCH,"Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko."
218235,L368215,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Did he harm the girl?
218236,L368214,u6470,m430,LURCH,Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
218237,L368213,u6468,m430,DOYLE,And he took a swing at you?
218238,L368212,u6470,m430,LURCH,"The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole..."
218239,L368388,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
218240,L368387,u6476,m430,ZYDOWSKI,He said he was following up some lead.
218241,L368386,u6468,m430,DOYLE,And where the hell is Marvosa?
218242,L368380,u6476,m430,ZYDOWSKI,Could explain why Fleming was there.
218243,L368379,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
218244,L368378,u6476,m430,ZYDOWSKI,"Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?"
218245,L368377,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Something I don't already know?
218246,L368376,u6476,m430,ZYDOWSKI,Well read this -
218247,L368375,u6468,m430,DOYLE,No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
218248,L368374,u6476,m430,ZYDOWSKI,Did you read today's paper?
218249,L368115,u6468,m430,DOYLE,"That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours..."
218250,L368114,u6476,m430,ZYDOWSKI,That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
218251,L368113,u6468,m430,DOYLE,What?  Wait a minute -
218252,L368112,u6476,m430,ZYDOWSKI,"Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago."
218253,L368111,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Yeah?
218254,L368110,u6476,m430,ZYDOWSKI,You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
218255,L368109,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Zydowski.  It's about time.
218256,L368432,u6472,m430,OFFICER,"LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa."
218257,L368431,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Yeah?
218258,L368430,u6472,m430,OFFICER,Captain?
218259,L368384,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
218260,L368383,u6472,m430,OFFICER,They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
218261,L368382,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Speak of the devil.
218262,L368314,u6472,m430,OFFICER,I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
218263,L368313,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Where is he?!!
218264,L368247,u6472,m430,OFFICER,I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
218265,L368246,u6468,m430,DOYLE,Who is it?
218266,L368245,u6472,m430,OFFICER,Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
218267,L368579,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,"Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise..."
218268,L368578,u6469,m430,JIM,No -
218269,L368577,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
218270,L368576,u6469,m430,JIM,Where the hell is my car?
218271,L368575,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,Yeah.
218272,L368574,u6469,m430,JIM,"There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie."
218273,L368526,u6469,m430,JIM,"So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them."
218274,L368525,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
218275,L368524,u6469,m430,JIM,What happened with the tape?
218276,L368523,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
218277,L368522,u6469,m430,JIM,What did you do then?
218278,L368521,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,I had it all on tape...
218279,L368518,u6469,m430,JIM,Found what?
218280,L368517,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,"I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it."
218281,L368516,u6469,m430,JIM,And what did you do?
218282,L368504,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,Yeah...they did.  One girl...
218283,L368503,u6469,m430,JIM,Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
218284,L368502,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,"I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened."
218285,L368501,u6469,m430,JIM,"No, but I'm listening."
218286,L368500,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,"Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it..."
218287,L368499,u6469,m430,JIM,What exactly did you see?
218288,L368498,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,No.  A witness.
218289,L368497,u6469,m430,JIM,Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
218290,L368496,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
218291,L368495,u6469,m430,JIM,Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
218292,L368494,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
218293,L368493,u6469,m430,JIM,Why did you set me up?
218294,L368456,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,You'll find out - soon enough.
218295,L368455,u6469,m430,JIM,What's going on here?
218296,L367994,u6469,m430,JIM,Only on dates?
218297,L367993,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,No.
218298,L367992,u6469,m430,JIM,You always carry a gun with you?
218299,L367991,u6469,m430,JIM,Figure you would have tried it already.
218300,L367990,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,"You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?"
218301,L367989,u6469,m430,JIM,No...
218302,L367988,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,Mind if I turn out the light?
218303,L367985,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,"You're the mysterious type, right?"
218304,L367984,u6469,m430,JIM,No...
218305,L367983,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,You got any family?
218306,L367982,u6469,m430,JIM,Seattle.
218307,L367981,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,Where up north?
218308,L367980,u6469,m430,JIM,Up north.
218309,L367979,u6473,m430,STEPHANIE,So where are you from?
218310,L368467,u6474,m430,TUBBS,Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
218311,L368466,u6469,m430,JIM,Are you going to be alright?
218312,L368464,u6469,m430,JIM,I'm going to need a way to get there.
218313,L368463,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry."
218314,L368462,u6474,m430,TUBBS,I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
218315,L368461,u6469,m430,JIM,"Tubbs, these people mean business."
218316,L368460,u6474,m430,TUBBS,I'm not going anywhere!
218317,L368459,u6469,m430,JIM,That was her - the girl... We have to go.
218318,L368448,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this."
218319,L368447,u6469,m430,JIM,It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
218320,L368446,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place..."
218321,L368444,u6474,m430,TUBBS,And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
218322,L368443,u6469,m430,JIM,Both at the same bank...
218323,L368442,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa."
218324,L368441,u6469,m430,JIM,A bank?
218325,L368440,u6474,m430,TUBBS,OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
218326,L368372,u6469,m430,JIM,What else is new?
218327,L368371,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time."
218328,L368370,u6469,m430,JIM,"I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess."
218329,L368369,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days."
218330,L368368,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -"
218331,L368367,u6469,m430,JIM,How about Marvosa and the others?
218332,L368366,u6469,m430,JIM,OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
218333,L368365,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?"
218334,L368364,u6469,m430,JIM,I knew I could count on you.
218335,L368363,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico."
218336,L368362,u6469,m430,JIM,No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
218337,L368361,u6474,m430,TUBBS,Donut?
218338,L368360,u6474,m430,TUBBS,Let's see what we got...
218339,L368359,u6469,m430,JIM,1490...Breckinridge...
218340,L368358,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?"
218341,L368356,u6474,m430,TUBBS,OK...where do you want to start?
218342,L368355,u6469,m430,JIM,I've got a better idea...
218343,L368354,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?"
218344,L368353,u6469,m430,JIM,I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
218345,L368352,u6474,m430,TUBBS,Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
218346,L368351,u6469,m430,JIM,I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
218347,L368350,u6474,m430,TUBBS,Oh man...what happened?
218348,L368349,u6469,m430,JIM,"I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!"
218349,L368348,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!"
218350,L368347,u6469,m430,JIM,"They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe."
218351,L368346,u6474,m430,TUBBS,You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
218352,L368345,u6469,m430,JIM,"It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -"
218353,L368344,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -"
218354,L368343,u6469,m430,JIM,Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
218355,L368342,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!"
218356,L368341,u6469,m430,JIM,I killed them.
218357,L368340,u6474,m430,TUBBS,And?...
218358,L368338,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!"
218359,L368337,u6469,m430,JIM,No...
218360,L368332,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!"
218361,L368331,u6469,m430,JIM,Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
218362,L368330,u6474,m430,TUBBS,Holy shit -
218363,L368273,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--"
218364,L368272,u6469,m430,JIM,"Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972..."
218365,L368180,u6469,m430,JIM,Please...
218366,L368179,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Jesus, man..."
218367,L368178,u6469,m430,JIM,It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
218368,L368177,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?"
218369,L368176,u6469,m430,JIM,Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
218370,L368175,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -"
218371,L368173,u6469,m430,JIM,Yeah...
218372,L368172,u6474,m430,TUBBS,Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
218373,L368171,u6469,m430,JIM,No...I'm in some trouble...
218374,L368170,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?"
218375,L368169,u6469,m430,JIM,"Tubbs, it's me."
218376,L368166,u6469,m430,JIM,Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
218377,L368165,u6474,m430,TUBBS,What?
218378,L367971,u6475,m430,WOMAN,Not with this...
218379,L367970,u6469,m430,JIM,You don't seem afraid of much.
218380,L367969,u6475,m430,WOMAN,Screw him!
218381,L367968,u6469,m430,JIM,What would your - boyfriend - think?
218382,L367966,u6469,m430,JIM,Bartender said there are motels south of here.
218383,L367965,u6475,m430,WOMAN,We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
218384,L367964,u6469,m430,JIM,Ditched you?
218385,L367963,u6475,m430,WOMAN,Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
218386,L367962,u6469,m430,JIM,Are you a regular there?
218387,L367961,u6475,m430,WOMAN,"Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual."
218388,L367960,u6475,m430,WOMAN,Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
218389,L367957,u6469,m430,JIM,Hop in.
218390,L367956,u6475,m430,WOMAN,I'm stranded out here.
218391,L367955,u6475,m430,WOMAN,Mind if I come along for the ride?
218392,L367954,u6469,m430,JIM,I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
218393,L367953,u6475,m430,WOMAN,You must be going somewhere.
218394,L367952,u6469,m430,JIM,"Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?"
218395,L367951,u6475,m430,WOMAN,Where are you going?
218396,L368063,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,County jail - get in.
218397,L368062,u6469,m430,JIM,Where am I going?
218398,L368048,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"Then what did you do, play canasta?"
218399,L368047,u6469,m430,JIM,No.  It wasn't like that!
218400,L368046,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
218401,L368045,u6469,m430,JIM,What?
218402,L368044,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Did you have sex with her?
218403,L368043,u6469,m430,JIM,No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
218404,L368486,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Nahhh...
218405,L368485,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead..."
218406,L368484,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
218407,L368483,u6474,m430,TUBBS,I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
218408,L368482,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,"Long gone, huh?"
218409,L368472,u6474,m430,TUBBS,"Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?"
218410,L368471,u6471,m430,MARVOSA,Where is he?
218411,L368470,u6474,m430,TUBBS,Don't you guys ever knock?
218412,L369119,u6477,m431,BLOOM,I don't recommend it.
218413,L369118,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Could he handle a direct contact?
218414,L369117,u6477,m431,BLOOM,"If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?"
218415,L369116,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,What's the bottom line?
218416,L369115,u6477,m431,BLOOM,"No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown."
218417,L369114,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,That's when it happened?
218418,L369113,u6477,m431,BLOOM,I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
218419,L369112,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
218420,L369111,u6477,m431,BLOOM,Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
218421,L369110,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Why aren't you ever alone with him?
218422,L369109,u6477,m431,BLOOM,"He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him."
218423,L369108,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?"
218424,L369107,u6477,m431,BLOOM,I wouldn't presume to try.
218425,L369106,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
218426,L369105,u6477,m431,BLOOM,It was you who did the asking.
218427,L369104,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,That was Peterson upstairs.
218428,L369103,u6477,m431,BLOOM,"Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now."
218429,L369102,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
218430,L369101,u6477,m431,BLOOM,What about him?
218431,L369258,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!"
218432,L369257,u6477,m431,BLOOM,How are Molly and the boy?
218433,L369256,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
218434,L369255,u6477,m431,BLOOM,"The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this."
218435,L369254,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
218436,L369129,u6477,m431,BLOOM,He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
218437,L369128,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What have we missed?
218438,L369122,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?"
218439,L369121,u6477,m431,BLOOM,Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
218440,L369019,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
218441,L369018,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
218442,L369017,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
218443,L369016,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
218444,L369015,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
218445,L368986,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,Christ!
218446,L368985,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,In thirty-five minutes.
218447,L368974,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He doesn't have anything to cut with.
218448,L368973,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
218449,L368972,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
218450,L369023,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,Library of Congress.
218451,L369022,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Where?
218452,L369021,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
218453,L369020,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place..."
218454,L369014,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
218455,L369013,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Not the Bible?
218456,L369012,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
218457,L369011,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Book code?
218458,L369010,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,"No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him."
218459,L368998,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
218460,L368997,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,"If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it."
218461,L368984,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,When do they go to press?
218462,L368983,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
218463,L368979,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
218464,L368978,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
218465,L368977,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
218466,L368971,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Twenty minutes max.
218467,L368970,u6478,m431,BOWMAN,How long do I have?
218468,L369005,u6479,m431,CHESTER,'You're very beautiful.
218469,L369004,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
218470,L369003,u6479,m431,CHESTER,"'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'"
218471,L369002,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Read it.
218472,L369001,u6479,m431,CHESTER,"We got an ad order in tonight's ""Tattler"" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now."
218473,L369000,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"Will Graham, Jack Crawford..."
218474,L368999,u6479,m431,CHESTER,This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
218475,L369100,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
218476,L369099,u6490,m431,MOLLY,Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
218477,L368635,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
218478,L368634,u6490,m431,MOLLY,No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
218479,L368633,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?"
218480,L368632,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"You wouldn't like it, either if you had it."
218481,L368631,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it..."
218482,L368630,u6490,m431,MOLLY,He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
218483,L368629,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Because it's his bad luck to be special.
218484,L368628,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?"
218485,L368627,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,I have to.
218486,L368626,u6490,m431,MOLLY,"Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?"
218487,L369492,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"It's happening again, Jack..."
218488,L369491,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Wait for the back-up! Will?
218489,L369490,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"There's somebody in the house, Jack..."
218490,L369489,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Stay in the trees.
218491,L369488,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I'll cover the back.
218492,L369487,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Three minutes.
218493,L369486,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,How far away's the back-up?
218494,L369485,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
218495,L369482,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
218496,L369481,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What?
218497,L369480,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Will...?
218498,L369475,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,This is our boy...!
218499,L369474,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
218500,L369459,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
218501,L369458,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Parking permits...
218502,L369443,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
218503,L369442,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"It does, doesn't it?"
218504,L369441,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,See if there's another label underneath.
218505,L369440,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Have him peel the top label back.
218506,L369439,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
218507,L369438,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
218508,L369437,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri."
218509,L369435,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
218510,L369434,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
218511,L369433,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,It's the guard in the storeroom.
218512,L369422,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Don't talk to me!!
218513,L369421,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,It's getting late and...
218514,L369418,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,He had to.
218515,L369417,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
218516,L369416,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
218517,L369415,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
218518,L369414,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,What's that?
218519,L369413,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,That's why the boltcutter.
218520,L369412,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,You wanna watch this or what?!
218521,L369411,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Will?
218522,L369410,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight."
218523,L369409,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,It's not over yet.
218524,L369408,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh..."
218525,L369407,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Something Lecktor said.
218526,L369406,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,What?
218527,L369405,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,He's a very shy boy...
218528,L369404,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
218529,L369403,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,There has to be.
218530,L369402,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,There's no connection between the families.
218531,L369401,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him."
218532,L369400,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,How do I know?!
218533,L369399,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?"
218534,L369398,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again..."
218535,L369397,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,'Changes?'
218536,L369396,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important."
218537,L369337,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,When I'm done.
218538,L369336,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,When are you coming back?
218539,L369335,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,That's narrow?
218540,L369334,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit."
218541,L369333,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What's it narrow down to?
218542,L369332,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning."
218543,L369331,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
218544,L369330,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,You got the message Lecktor called...
218545,L369138,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,No.
218546,L369137,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?
218547,L369043,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,I won't be here.
218548,L369042,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,I'll pick you up in...
218549,L369041,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Get me a plane!
218550,L369040,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"Wait, Will..."
218551,L369039,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Get me a plane...
218552,L369038,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address."
218553,L369037,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Tell me now.
218554,L369036,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you."
218555,L369035,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What'd it say?
218556,L369034,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now."
218557,L369033,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Who is it?
218558,L369032,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,We will feel sick for a very long time.
218559,L369031,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
218560,L369030,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Run it.
218561,L369029,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"It's your call, Will. What do we do?"
218562,L369028,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,"And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon."
218563,L369027,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
218564,L369026,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
218565,L369025,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week."
218566,L369024,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
218567,L368982,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Personal ads?
218568,L368981,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
218569,L368980,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
218570,L368954,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
218571,L368953,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up."
218572,L368944,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,What is it?
218573,L368943,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!"
218574,L368888,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,You.
218575,L368887,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Who did he ask for?
218576,L368881,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
218577,L368880,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
218578,L368879,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,The mark? Yes.
218579,L368878,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,Is it weird?
218580,L368728,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,To recover the mind set.
218581,L368727,u6480,m431,CRAWFORD,"For Christ's sake, why?"
218582,L368726,u6484,m431,GRAHAM,...I'm going to see Lecktor.
