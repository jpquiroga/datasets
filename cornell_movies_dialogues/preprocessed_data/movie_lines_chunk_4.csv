144941,L110857,u4251,m283,SPOOR,"Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?"
144942,L110856,u4233,m283,DOWSER,Mumble ... Tuttle ...
144943,L110855,u4251,m283,SPOOR,Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
144944,L110854,u4233,m283,DOWSER,Got there!
144945,L110853,u4251,m283,SPOOR,What have you got there?
144946,L110731,u4233,m283,DOWSER,... have a look.
144947,L110730,u4251,m283,SPOOR,I think we'd better have a look.
144948,L110728,u4233,m283,DOWSER,"...ampered. with it, Spoor."
144949,L110727,u4251,m283,SPOOR,"He's tampered with it, Dowser."
144950,L110726,u4233,m283,DOWSER,... fix themselves.
144951,L110725,u4251,m283,SPOOR,Machines don't fix themselves.
144952,L110724,u4233,m283,DOWSER,...ixed itself.
144953,L110718,u4233,m283,DOWSER,...ditioning.
144954,L110717,u4251,m283,SPOOR,Trouble with your air-conditioning.
144955,L110716,u4233,m283,DOWSER,...elephoned sir.
144956,L110715,u4251,m283,SPOOR,"You telephone, sir."
144957,L110678,u4234,m283,GENT,You must save the day.
144958,L110677,u4249,m283,SAM,What do I have to do.
144959,L110676,u4234,m283,GENT,"Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one"
144960,L110675,u4249,m283,SAM,What? You mean you've got ...
144961,L110674,u4234,m283,GENT,"Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away."
144962,L110673,u4234,m283,GENT,We know that too. You've come to the right place.
144963,L110672,u4249,m283,SAM,Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
144964,L110671,u4234,m283,GENT,We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
144965,L110670,u4249,m283,SAM,What? How do you know my name?
144966,L110669,u4234,m283,GENT,"Ah ha ... there you are, Sam."
144967,L110881,u4235,m283,GIRL,Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
144968,L110880,u4249,m283,SAM,"Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you."
144969,L110879,u4235,m283,GIRL,"Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?"
144970,L110878,u4249,m283,SAM,Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
144971,L110877,u4249,m283,SAM,"Oh, right ..."
144972,L110876,u4235,m283,GIRL,You don't have to sing it.
144973,L110875,u4249,m283,SAM,"Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -"
144974,L110874,u4235,m283,GIRL,It's reply paid.
144975,L110873,u4249,m283,SAM,Er ... Thanks ...
144976,L110822,u4249,m283,SAM,He will be pleased when he comes home.
144977,L110821,u4236,m283,GIRL BUTTLE,I'm waiting for my daddy.
144978,L110820,u4249,m283,SAM,Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
144979,L110819,u4236,m283,GIRL BUTTLE,Layton.
144980,L110818,u4249,m283,SAM,What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
144981,L110817,u4236,m283,GIRL BUTTLE,Her name is Jill.
144982,L110816,u4249,m283,SAM,Go away.
144983,L110508,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all."
144984,L110507,u4238,m283,INTERVIEWER,"Thank you very much, Deputy Minister."
144985,L110506,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,Beginner's luck.
144986,L110505,u4238,m283,INTERVIEWER,But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
144987,L110504,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game."
144988,L110503,u4238,m283,INTERVIEWER,Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
144989,L110501,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
144990,L110500,u4238,m283,INTERVIEWER,"And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ..."
144991,L110499,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
144992,L110498,u4238,m283,INTERVIEWER,"Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?"
144993,L110497,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life."
144994,L110496,u4238,m283,INTERVIEWER,"In fact, killing people -"
144995,L110495,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -"
144996,L110494,u4238,m283,INTERVIEWER,"Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?"
144997,L111382,u4249,m283,SAM,"No, no ... I did that..."
144998,L111381,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest."
144999,L111379,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion."
145000,L111378,u4249,m283,SAM,"Please, I've got to find Jill."
145001,L111377,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about."
145002,L111376,u4249,m283,SAM,I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
145003,L111375,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ..."
145004,L111374,u4249,m283,SAM,This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
145005,L111373,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me."
145006,L111372,u4249,m283,SAM,Help me!
145007,L111371,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water."
145008,L111370,u4249,m283,SAM,"Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her."
145009,L111369,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,Gillian Layton?
145010,L111368,u4249,m283,SAM,Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
145011,L111367,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,"Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?"
145012,L110942,u4249,m283,SAM,"Well ... well, I ..."
145013,L110941,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,Too late? That's for me to say.
145014,L110940,u4249,m283,SAM,Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
145015,L110939,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
145016,L110937,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
145017,L110936,u4249,m283,SAM,Sorry ...
145018,L110935,u4249,m283,SAM,"Well, I ..."
145019,L110934,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,If I can help you ...
145020,L110933,u4249,m283,SAM,That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
145021,L110932,u4237,m283,HELPMANN,Thanks very much Sam.
145022,L111399,u4239,m283,JACK,Shut up! This is a professional relationship!
145023,L111398,u4249,m283,SAM,Jack ...
145024,L111397,u4239,m283,JACK,How do you think I feel? You shit!
145025,L111396,u4249,m283,SAM,"Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!"
145026,L111395,u4239,m283,JACK,How could you do this to me?
145027,L111394,u4249,m283,SAM,What?
145028,L111393,u4239,m283,JACK,You stupid bastard!
145029,L111392,u4249,m283,SAM,"This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off."
145030,L111391,u4239,m283,JACK,Bastard!!!
145031,L111390,u4249,m283,SAM,"Jack, I'm innocent! Help me."
145032,L111389,u4239,m283,JACK,Shut up!
145033,L111388,u4249,m283,SAM,Jack?... Jack?
145034,L111275,u4239,m283,JACK,"Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over."
145035,L111274,u4249,m283,SAM,"Yes we have, Jack!"
145036,L111273,u4239,m283,JACK,"Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?"
145037,L111272,u4249,m283,SAM,"Jack, she's innocent!"
145038,L111271,u4239,m283,JACK,"There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye."
145039,L111270,u4249,m283,SAM,It could all be coincidental.
145040,L111269,u4239,m283,JACK,I do. Goodbye.
145041,L111268,u4249,m283,SAM,You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
145042,L111267,u4239,m283,JACK,"Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye."
145043,L111266,u4249,m283,SAM,"She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong."
145044,L111265,u4239,m283,JACK,"I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked."
145045,L111264,u4249,m283,SAM,"Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested."
145046,L111087,u4239,m283,JACK,Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas.
145047,L111086,u4249,m283,SAM,Trust me.
145048,L111085,u4239,m283,JACK,Do you know what you're doing.
145049,L111084,u4249,m283,SAM,"Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch."
145050,L111083,u4239,m283,JACK,"Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it."
145051,L111082,u4249,m283,SAM,"Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while."
145052,L111081,u4239,m283,JACK,We don't make mistakes.
145053,L111080,u4249,m283,SAM,Say it was a mistake.
145054,L111079,u4239,m283,JACK,There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
145055,L111078,u4249,m283,SAM,Take her off the list.
145056,L111077,u4239,m283,JACK,"But, I've already put her on the search and detain list."
145057,L111076,u4249,m283,SAM,They weren't at school with us.
145058,L111075,u4239,m283,JACK,Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
145059,L111074,u4249,m283,SAM,Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
145060,L111073,u4239,m283,JACK,You're the only person I can trust.
145061,L111072,u4249,m283,SAM,And you're mine.
145062,L111071,u4239,m283,JACK,Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
145063,L111070,u4249,m283,SAM,"Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?"
145064,L111069,u4239,m283,JACK,What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
145065,L111068,u4249,m283,SAM,Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
145066,L111067,u4239,m283,JACK,"Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?"
145067,L111066,u4249,m283,SAM,You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
145068,L111065,u4239,m283,JACK,Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
145069,L111064,u4249,m283,SAM,So what are you going to do about her?
145070,L111063,u4239,m283,JACK,Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
145071,L111062,u4249,m283,SAM,Out of kindness.
145072,L111061,u4239,m283,JACK,{baffled) I don't follow you.
145073,L111060,u4249,m283,SAM,"Why? Hell, not for any reason ..."
145074,L111059,u4239,m283,JACK,Why?
145075,L111058,u4249,m283,SAM,"Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family."
145076,L111057,u4239,m283,JACK,"Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?"
145077,L111056,u4249,m283,SAM,"Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?"
145078,L111055,u4239,m283,JACK,"Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me."
145079,L111054,u4249,m283,SAM,"But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ..."
145080,L111052,u4249,m283,SAM,A terrorist?
145081,L111051,u4239,m283,JACK,"She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us."
145082,L111050,u4249,m283,SAM,Tell me about Layton.
145083,L111049,u4239,m283,JACK,Yes. I'm impressed.
145084,L111048,u4249,m283,SAM,Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
145085,L111047,u4239,m283,JACK,Very smart.
145086,L111046,u4249,m283,SAM,Er ... no.
145087,L111045,u4239,m283,JACK,"You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?"
145088,L111044,u4249,m283,SAM,What's she done?
145089,L111043,u4239,m283,JACK,"He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest."
145090,L111042,u4249,m283,SAM,He's a freelance subversive?
145091,L111041,u4239,m283,JACK,We suspect him of freelance subversion.
145092,L111040,u4249,m283,SAM,What has Tuttle done?
145093,L111039,u4239,m283,JACK,"What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking."
145094,L111038,u4249,m283,SAM,So how ...?
145095,L111037,u4239,m283,JACK,"There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for."
145096,L111036,u4249,m283,SAM,I'm sure you have
145097,L111035,u4239,m283,JACK,"Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already."
145098,L111034,u4249,m283,SAM,You killed him?
145099,L111033,u4239,m283,JACK,"I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done."
145100,L111032,u4249,m283,SAM,You got the wrong man.
145101,L111031,u4239,m283,JACK,"Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake."
145102,L111030,u4249,m283,SAM,"No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on."
145103,L111029,u4239,m283,JACK,Christ! You do know it all!
145104,L111028,u4249,m283,SAM,"B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?"
145105,L111027,u4239,m283,JACK,"OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215."
145106,L111026,u4249,m283,SAM,"Not really, no."
145107,L111025,u4239,m283,JACK,"Enough though, eh?"
145108,L111024,u4249,m283,SAM,Not much.
145109,L111023,u4239,m283,JACK,How much do you know?
145110,L111022,u4249,m283,SAM,How do you mean?
145111,L111021,u4239,m283,JACK,"Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense."
145112,L111020,u4249,m283,SAM,Am I?
145113,L111019,u4239,m283,JACK,You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
145114,L111018,u4249,m283,SAM,What is it?

145308,L110833,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
145309,L110832,u4249,m283,SAM,You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
145310,L110831,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,What's the matter?
145311,L110830,u4249,m283,SAM,Damn! Blast!
145312,L110828,u4249,m283,SAM,Yes.
145313,L110827,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,Can I forget it?
145314,L110826,u4249,m283,SAM,I delivered it.
145315,L110825,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
145316,L110790,u4249,m283,SAM,Don't mention it. See you later.
145317,L110789,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,You are good to me Sam.
145318,L110788,u4249,m283,SAM,That's it.
145319,L110787,u4249,m283,SAM,Here.
145320,L110786,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
145321,L110785,u4249,m283,SAM,Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
145322,L110784,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,"Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?"
145323,L110783,u4249,m283,SAM,Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
145324,L110782,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,Here. What do I do next?
145325,L110779,u4249,m283,SAM,"Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop."
145326,L110778,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,What?
145327,L110777,u4249,m283,SAM,"You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option."
145328,L110776,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,"Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ..."
145329,L110775,u4249,m283,SAM,Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
145330,L110772,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,27156789/074328/K.
145331,L110771,u4249,m283,SAM,There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
145332,L110770,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,Next of kin!
145333,L110769,u4249,m283,SAM,Try next of kin.
145334,L110768,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
145335,L110767,u4249,m283,SAM,He is dead.
145336,L110766,u4249,m283,SAM,Hang on.
145337,L110765,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,"I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed"
145338,L110764,u4249,m283,SAM,Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
145339,L110763,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,"We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!"
145340,L110762,u4249,m283,SAM,I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
145341,L110761,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,"I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!"
145342,L110760,u4249,m283,SAM,Tuttle?
145343,L110759,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,The refund for Tuttle!
145344,L110758,u4249,m283,SAM,A cheque.
145345,L110578,u4249,m283,SAM,What a BITCH!
145346,L110577,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
145347,L110576,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,You've been promoted.
145348,L110575,u4249,m283,SAM,Really.
145349,L110574,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,"Would you really, Sam?"
145350,L110573,u4249,m283,SAM,I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
145351,L110572,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,But if they did promote you
145352,L110571,u4249,m283,SAM,Don't worry.
145353,L110570,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
145354,L110569,u4249,m283,SAM,"Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer"
145355,L110568,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,"Oh, good!"
145356,L110567,u4249,m283,SAM,Information Retrieval.
145357,L110566,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,Isn't it? Whose is it?
145358,L110565,u4249,m283,SAM,It's not our mistake!
145359,L110564,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,"Oh my God, a mistake!"
145360,L110563,u4249,m283,SAM,"It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle."
145361,L110562,u4241,m283,KURTZMAN,"Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?"
145362,L111261,u4242,m283,LIME,"Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself."
145363,L111260,u4249,m283,SAM,"Lime, I need to use your computer"
145364,L110990,u4249,m283,SAM,"Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver! All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001.  That's what I wanted to know. Thank you very much."
145365,L110989,u4242,m283,LIME,Hey - that's my desk!
145366,L110982,u4242,m283,LIME,"Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished."
145367,L110981,u4249,m283,SAM,You haven't switched it on.
145368,L110980,u4242,m283,LIME,"Sod it, it's broken!"
145369,L110979,u4242,m283,LIME,"You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet."
145370,L110978,u4249,m283,SAM,"What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes."
145371,L110977,u4242,m283,LIME,"This is your dream girl, is it?"
145372,L110976,u4249,m283,SAM,I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
145373,L110975,u4242,m283,LIME,A woman eh? I see.
145374,L110974,u4249,m283,SAM,Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
145375,L110973,u4242,m283,LIME,I'll tell you what .... You tell me what and I'll do it for. I'm a bit of a whizz on this thing.
145376,L110972,u4249,m283,SAM,Yes.
145377,L110971,u4242,m283,LIME,You want to take my console into your office?
145378,L110970,u4249,m283,SAM,I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
145379,L110969,u4242,m283,LIME,What?
145380,L110968,u4249,m283,SAM,Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
145381,L110967,u4242,m283,LIME,"Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting."
145382,L110966,u4249,m283,SAM,Sam Lowry.
145383,L110965,u4242,m283,LIME,"No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?"
145384,L111314,u4243,m283,MATTHEWS,There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
145385,L111313,u4249,m283,SAM,How long will she he away?
145386,L111312,u4243,m283,MATTHEWS,I won't be held responsible.
145387,L111311,u4249,m283,SAM,"Well, she's my mother, not yours."
145388,L111310,u4243,m283,MATTHEWS,She didn't say anything about it to me.
145389,L111309,u4249,m283,SAM,My mother said it would be all right.
145390,L110633,u4244,m283,MOTHER,"I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ..."
145391,L110632,u4250,m283,SPIRO,"Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise."
145392,L110619,u4250,m283,SPIRO,"A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?"
145393,L110618,u4244,m283,MOTHER,"Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please."
145394,L110604,u4244,m283,MOTHER,We're meeting Mrs Terrain.

145396,L110602,u4244,m283,MOTHER,"You remember Samuel, my son."
145397,L110601,u4250,m283,SPIRO,I'm sorry but ...
145398,L110600,u4244,m283,MOTHER,"Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas."
145399,L111411,u4244,m283,MOTHER,Not now ... please
145400,L111410,u4249,m283,SAM,Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
145401,L111409,u4244,m283,MOTHER,Sam!!!
145402,L110889,u4249,m283,SAM,"Actually, I've decided ..."
145403,L110888,u4244,m283,MOTHER,It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
145404,L110887,u4249,m283,SAM,I want to talk to him.
145405,L110886,u4244,m283,MOTHER,Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
145406,L110885,u4249,m283,SAM,Is Mr Helpmann here?
145407,L110884,u4244,m283,MOTHER,Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
145408,L110883,u4249,m283,SAM,Mother? Is that you?
145409,L110659,u4244,m283,MOTHER,"Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams."
145410,L110658,u4249,m283,SAM,I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
145411,L110657,u4244,m283,MOTHER,Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
145412,L110650,u4249,m283,SAM,Mother!
145413,L110649,u4244,m283,MOTHER,"Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval."
145414,L110641,u4244,m283,MOTHER,"By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens."
145415,L110640,u4249,m283,SAM,This isn't rare!
145416,L110639,u4244,m283,MOTHER,What were we saying?
145417,L110598,u4244,m283,MOTHER,It's something for executives.
145418,L110597,u4249,m283,SAM,What is it?
145419,L110596,u4244,m283,MOTHER,I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
145420,L110594,u4249,m283,SAM,"You're not listening, mother."
145421,L110593,u4244,m283,MOTHER,Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
145422,L110581,u4244,m283,MOTHER,No you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition. You haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was very close -
145423,L110580,u4249,m283,SAM,"I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am."
145424,L110809,u4245,m283,MRS BUTTLE,He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
145425,L110808,u4249,m283,SAM,Uh ...
145426,L110806,u4249,m283,SAM,Um ...
145427,L110805,u4245,m283,MRS BUTTLE,What have you done with his body?
145428,L110804,u4249,m283,SAM,"Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms."
145429,L110803,u4245,m283,MRS BUTTLE,"My husband's dead, isn't he?"
145430,L110802,u4249,m283,SAM,"Yes. Not my department ... I'm only records. It seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose we're all human."
145431,L110801,u4245,m283,MRS BUTTLE,Mistake?
145432,L110800,u4249,m283,SAM,It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
145433,L111233,u4246,m283,MRS TERRAIN,Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
145434,L111232,u4249,m283,SAM,"Er, yes ..."
145435,L111231,u4246,m283,MRS TERRAIN,"My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?"
145436,L111230,u4249,m283,SAM,I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
145437,L111229,u4249,m283,SAM,"Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off."
145438,L110908,u4249,m283,SAM,I ... uh ...
145439,L110907,u4246,m283,MRS TERRAIN,Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
145440,L110906,u4246,m283,MRS TERRAIN,"I know, I know ...!"
145441,L110905,u4249,m283,SAM,"Actually, there's someone I want to meet ..."
145442,L110904,u4246,m283,MRS TERRAIN,There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
145443,L110903,u4249,m283,SAM,Whatever happened to you?
145444,L110648,u4249,m283,SAM,What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
145445,L110647,u4246,m283,MRS TERRAIN,"Really, Sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?"
145446,L110635,u4250,m283,SPIRO,"Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit."
145447,L110634,u4246,m283,MRS TERRAIN,"That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive."
145448,L110629,u4250,m283,SPIRO,"Numero deux, duck a l'orange."
145449,L110628,u4246,m283,MRS TERRAIN,It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
145450,L110627,u4250,m283,SPIRO,"Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce."
145451,L110615,u4246,m283,MRS TERRAIN,"Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?"
145452,L110614,u4250,m283,SPIRO,"Between you and me, Madam, today the number two."
145453,L110613,u4246,m283,MRS TERRAIN,"I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?"
145454,L110686,u4249,m283,SAM,What? Who is this?
145455,L110685,u4247,m283,PHONE VOICE,Put the phone down and your hands up.

145514,L110748,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,Time to go.
145515,L110747,u4249,m283,SAM,What do they want you or?
145516,L110746,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,"My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!"
145517,L110745,u4249,m283,SAM,"Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -"
145518,L110710,u4249,m283,SAM,No. Wait here.
145519,L110709,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,Are you expecting anyone?
145520,L110707,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,No. But I can bypass it with one of these
145521,L110706,u4249,m283,SAM,Can you fix it?
145522,L110705,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,"Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem."
145523,L110704,u4249,m283,SAM,Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
145524,L110703,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,"The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork."
145525,L110702,u4249,m283,SAM,The pace?
145526,L110701,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
145527,L110700,u4249,m283,SAM,Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
145528,L110699,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,"... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir."
145529,L110698,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,"Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these."
145530,L110697,u4249,m283,SAM,Are you saying this is illegal?
145531,L110696,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,"A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle."
145532,L110694,u4249,m283,SAM,What?
145533,L110693,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
145534,L110692,u4249,m283,SAM,But ... I called Central Services.
145535,L110691,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,Ha!!
145536,L110690,u4249,m283,SAM,Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
145537,L110689,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
145538,L110688,u4249,m283,SAM,What is this?  Who the hell are you?
145539,L110687,u4252,m283,TUTTLE,Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
145540,L112739,u4253,m284,CAPT. BARNEY,"Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy."
145541,L112738,u4258,m284,FRANK,What if there is no tomorrow?
145542,L112737,u4253,m284,CAPT. BARNEY,I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
145543,L112736,u4258,m284,FRANK,No ...
145544,L112735,u4253,m284,CAPT. BARNEY,"You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls."
145545,L112440,u4253,m284,CAPT. BARNEY,"I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you."
145546,L112439,u4258,m284,FRANK,I don't think a week's gonna do it.
145547,L112438,u4253,m284,CAPT. BARNEY,"I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?"
145548,L112437,u4258,m284,FRANK,You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
145549,L112436,u4253,m284,CAPT. BARNEY,"I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row."
145550,L112435,u4258,m284,FRANK,You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
145551,L112434,u4253,m284,CAPT. BARNEY,"Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself."
145552,L112433,u4258,m284,FRANK,I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
145553,L112432,u4253,m284,CAPT. BARNEY,I've never fired anyone in my life.
145554,L112431,u4258,m284,FRANK,It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
145555,L112430,u4253,m284,CAPT. BARNEY,"You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate."
145556,L112429,u4258,m284,FRANK,I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
145557,L112428,u4253,m284,CAPT. BARNEY,"What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early."
145558,L112609,u4254,m284,CARLOS,It's a miracle.
145559,L112608,u4258,m284,FRANK,You can trust me on this one.
145560,L112607,u4254,m284,CARLOS,Es impossible.
145561,L112606,u4258,m284,FRANK,She's having a baby. Twins.
145562,L112605,u4254,m284,CARLOS,Is she dying?
145563,L112589,u4258,m284,FRANK,Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
145564,L112588,u4254,m284,CARLOS,She say she in great pain.
145565,L112587,u4258,m284,FRANK,Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
145566,L112586,u4258,m284,FRANK,Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
145567,L112585,u4254,m284,CARLOS,"No, no, that's impossible."
145568,L112584,u4258,m284,FRANK,Pregnant.
145569,L112583,u4254,m284,CARLOS,No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
145570,L112597,u4254,m284,CARLOS,We are virgins.
145571,L112596,u4262,m284,MARCUS,No underwear?
145572,L112595,u4254,m284,CARLOS,"Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze."
145573,L112594,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"In that time, you ever have sex?"
145574,L112593,u4254,m284,CARLOS,Two years. Ever since we left island.
145575,L112592,u4262,m284,MARCUS,You know each other a long time?
145576,L112717,u4260,m284,KANITA,Stressed? He's psycho.
145577,L112716,u4255,m284,COATES,"Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?"
145578,L112715,u4260,m284,KANITA,He flipped out.
145579,L112714,u4255,m284,COATES,"Frank, take it easy. what happened?"
145580,L112674,u4255,m284,COATES,"He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates."
145581,L112673,u4260,m284,KANITA,He looks like a cop.
145582,L112672,u4255,m284,COATES,"It's okay, Kanita. Come on in."
145583,L112667,u4255,m284,COATES,Mary ...
145584,L112666,u4260,m284,KANITA,"Hey Cy, guess who's here?"
145585,L112837,u4255,m284,COATES,"Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot."
145586,L112836,u4258,m284,FRANK,No.
145587,L112835,u4255,m284,COATES,"That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?"
145588,L112834,u4258,m284,FRANK,Dead.
145589,L112833,u4255,m284,COATES,What about Kanita?
145590,L112832,u4258,m284,FRANK,I was tired. I needed a coffee.
145591,L112831,u4255,m284,COATES,"I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place."
145592,L112830,u4258,m284,FRANK,You're going to live.
145593,L112829,u4255,m284,COATES,"So, Frank, am I going to live?"
145594,L112828,u4255,m284,COATES,I can't hold up my head anymore.
145595,L112827,u4258,m284,FRANK,"They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm."
145596,L112825,u4255,m284,COATES,No!
145597,L112824,u4258,m284,FRANK,Does that hurt?
145598,L112700,u4255,m284,COATES,Just take it easy.
145599,L112699,u4258,m284,FRANK,I guess I'll be going.
145600,L112697,u4255,m284,COATES,That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
145601,L112696,u4258,m284,FRANK,Is this what you gave Mary?
145602,L112695,u4255,m284,COATES,"Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water."
145603,L112694,u4258,m284,FRANK,I should be going. I just quit.
145604,L112693,u4255,m284,COATES,"Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that."
145605,L112692,u4258,m284,FRANK,Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
145606,L112691,u4255,m284,COATES,"That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these."
145607,L112690,u4258,m284,FRANK,Got a beer?
145608,L112689,u4255,m284,COATES,"I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories."
145609,L112687,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Mary, we really have to go."
145610,L112686,u4255,m284,COATES,She wanted something to help her sleep.
145611,L112681,u4258,m284,FRANK,I better just go in and see her.
145612,L112680,u4255,m284,COATES,"I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?"
145613,L112679,u4258,m284,FRANK,She asked me to pick her up.
145614,L112678,u4255,m284,COATES,Sleeping in the back.
145615,L112677,u4258,m284,FRANK,Where is she?
145616,L112676,u4255,m284,COATES,Mary said you might be coming.

145650,L112388,u4264,m284,NOEL,What did you say?
145651,L112387,u4258,m284,FRANK,You're not going to die.
145652,L112364,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas."
145653,L112363,u4264,m284,NOEL,"Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?"
145654,L112362,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed."
145655,L112359,u4264,m284,NOEL,"No, no medicine!"
145656,L112358,u4258,m284,FRANK,"You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that."
145657,L112357,u4264,m284,NOEL,"See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert."
145658,L112226,u4258,m284,FRANK,I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
145659,L112225,u4264,m284,NOEL,Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
145660,L112944,u4263,m284,MARY,Come on up.
145661,L112943,u4258,m284,FRANK,Frank.
145662,L112942,u4263,m284,MARY,Who is it?
145663,L112870,u4258,m284,FRANK,There's no time.
145664,L112869,u4263,m284,MARY,This is not a good time.
145665,L112866,u4258,m284,FRANK,"No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody."
145666,L112865,u4263,m284,MARY,"No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough."
145667,L112864,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?"
145668,L112863,u4263,m284,MARY,I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
145669,L112862,u4258,m284,FRANK,No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
145670,L112861,u4263,m284,MARY,"OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it."
145671,L112860,u4258,m284,FRANK,It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
145672,L112859,u4263,m284,MARY,"Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him."
145673,L112858,u4258,m284,FRANK,He'll be all right.
145674,L112857,u4263,m284,MARY,I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
145675,L112729,u4263,m284,MARY,Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
145676,L112728,u4258,m284,FRANK,I need to sit down a minute.
145677,L112727,u4263,m284,MARY,"What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself."
145678,L112724,u4258,m284,FRANK,Because you can barely walk.
145679,L112723,u4263,m284,MARY,"You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?"
145680,L112685,u4263,m284,MARY,"No, no."
145681,L112684,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Mary. Mary, we've got to get going."
145682,L112664,u4263,m284,MARY,"Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault."
145683,L112663,u4258,m284,FRANK,"We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath."
145684,L112662,u4263,m284,MARY,I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
145685,L112661,u4258,m284,FRANK,Fifteen minutes.
145686,L112660,u4263,m284,MARY,Promise you won't go inside.
145687,L112659,u4258,m284,FRANK,You asked me not to come.
145688,L112658,u4263,m284,MARY,I shouldn't have asked you to come.
145689,L112657,u4263,m284,MARY,"No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend."
145690,L112656,u4258,m284,FRANK,Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
145691,L112655,u4263,m284,MARY,"If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go."
145692,L112654,u4258,m284,FRANK,Maybe I should come up with you.
145693,L112653,u4263,m284,MARY,"I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M."
145694,L112652,u4258,m284,FRANK,Okay.
145695,L112651,u4263,m284,MARY,"Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick."
145696,L112650,u4258,m284,FRANK,Don't seem so bad to me.
145697,L112649,u4263,m284,MARY,"I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up."
145698,L112648,u4258,m284,FRANK,Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
145699,L112558,u4258,m284,FRANK,Sure.
145700,L112557,u4263,m284,MARY,"I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this."
145701,L112556,u4258,m284,FRANK,Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
145702,L112555,u4263,m284,MARY,Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
145703,L112554,u4258,m284,FRANK,I think I'd remember that.
145704,L112553,u4263,m284,MARY,You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
145705,L112552,u4258,m284,FRANK,"You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow."
145706,L112551,u4263,m284,MARY,"Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?"
145707,L112550,u4258,m284,FRANK,Five years.
145708,L112549,u4263,m284,MARY,How long you been doing this?
145709,L112548,u4258,m284,FRANK,"It's been bad lately, but it's always bad."
145710,L112545,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too."
145711,L112544,u4263,m284,MARY,You married?
145712,L112543,u4258,m284,FRANK,"They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess."
145713,L112542,u4263,m284,MARY,Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
145714,L112541,u4258,m284,FRANK,We moved out after that. Upstate.
145715,L112540,u4263,m284,MARY,On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
145716,L112539,u4258,m284,FRANK,I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
145717,L112538,u4263,m284,MARY,"Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?"
145718,L112537,u4258,m284,FRANK,"You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?"
145719,L112536,u4263,m284,MARY,Not as good as Nino's.
145720,L112535,u4258,m284,FRANK,"It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?"
145721,L112534,u4263,m284,MARY,"My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ..."
145722,L112530,u4263,m284,MARY,"Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?"
145723,L112529,u4258,m284,FRANK,He's better.
145724,L112528,u4263,m284,MARY,"He's better, though, right?"
145725,L112527,u4258,m284,FRANK,That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
145726,L112526,u4263,m284,MARY,You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
145727,L112525,u4258,m284,FRANK,He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
145728,L112512,u4263,m284,MARY,Okay.
145729,L112511,u4258,m284,FRANK,Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
145730,L112510,u4263,m284,MARY,You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
145731,L112509,u4258,m284,FRANK,I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
145732,L112508,u4263,m284,MARY,Sleeping.
145733,L112507,u4258,m284,FRANK,How is she?
145734,L112506,u4263,m284,MARY,I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
145735,L112505,u4258,m284,FRANK,I think it looks good.
145736,L112504,u4263,m284,MARY,"I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders."
145737,L112503,u4258,m284,FRANK,You look so different.
145738,L112502,u4263,m284,MARY,I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
145739,L112501,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know."
145740,L112500,u4263,m284,MARY,"He's better, isn't he?"
145741,L112499,u4263,m284,MARY,I'll be right down.
145742,L112498,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news."
145743,L112497,u4263,m284,MARY,Yes?
145744,L112415,u4263,m284,MARY,"I'd take her, but then who would stay here?"
145745,L112414,u4258,m284,FRANK,She should go home.
145746,L112413,u4263,m284,MARY,"My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance."
145747,L112412,u4263,m284,MARY,"Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?"
145748,L112411,u4258,m284,FRANK,He's working a double shift.
145749,L112410,u4263,m284,MARY,"It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me."
145750,L112409,u4258,m284,FRANK,No.
145751,L112408,u4263,m284,MARY,Did you see my father?
145752,L112407,u4258,m284,FRANK,Our Lady of Misery.
145753,L112406,u4263,m284,MARY,I think this place stinks.
145754,L112405,u4258,m284,FRANK,Yes.
145755,L112404,u4263,m284,MARY,"He's dead, huh?"
145756,L112403,u4258,m284,FRANK,Yes.
145757,L112402,u4263,m284,MARY,"That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?"
145758,L112400,u4263,m284,MARY,That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
145759,L112399,u4258,m284,FRANK,It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
145760,L112398,u4263,m284,MARY,You shouldn't smoke.
145761,L112333,u4263,m284,MARY,"That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home."
145762,L112332,u4258,m284,FRANK,Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
145763,L112331,u4263,m284,MARY,"Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father."
145764,L112330,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Even when you say the things, there's always more things."
145765,L112329,u4263,m284,MARY,"I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say."
145766,L112328,u4258,m284,FRANK,At least he's got people around him.
145767,L112327,u4263,m284,MARY,"I mean if he was dead, I could handle that."
145768,L112326,u4258,m284,FRANK,You never know.
145769,L112325,u4263,m284,MARY,"It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door."
145770,L112324,u4258,m284,FRANK,The first is always the best.
145771,L112323,u4263,m284,MARY,It's my first cigarette in over a year.
145772,L112258,u4263,m284,MARY,"It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water."
145773,L112257,u4258,m284,FRANK,I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
145774,L112253,u4258,m284,FRANK,I guess there's always a chance.
145775,L112252,u4263,m284,MARY,Is there any chance?
145776,L112251,u4258,m284,FRANK,We'd better go outside. Quickly.
145777,L112250,u4263,m284,MARY,I know him. That's Noel.
145778,L112249,u4258,m284,FRANK,He's very very sick.
145779,L112207,u4258,m284,FRANK,His heart's beating.
145780,L112206,u4263,m284,MARY,Is he going to be alright?
145781,L112201,u4263,m284,MARY,"John, play the Sinatra."
145782,L112200,u4258,m284,FRANK,Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
145783,L112199,u4263,m284,MARY,What?
145784,L112198,u4258,m284,FRANK,Do you have any music?
145785,L112644,u4262,m284,MARCUS,You can't leave me now.
145786,L112643,u4258,m284,FRANK,I quit! I'm through!
145787,L112642,u4262,m284,MARCUS,Where you going?
145788,L112634,u4258,m284,FRANK,Greatest job in the world.
145789,L112633,u4262,m284,MARCUS,Here's to the greatest job in the world.
145790,L112632,u4258,m284,FRANK,I'll drink to that.
145791,L112631,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking."
145792,L112630,u4258,m284,FRANK,I hate vodka.
145793,L112628,u4258,m284,FRANK,"I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding."
145794,L112627,u4262,m284,MARCUS,We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
145795,L112626,u4258,m284,FRANK,You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
145796,L112625,u4262,m284,MARCUS,What look?
145797,L112624,u4258,m284,FRANK,Don't give me that look.
145798,L112604,u4262,m284,MARCUS,It's coming.
145799,L112603,u4258,m284,FRANK,Backup?
145800,L112602,u4262,m284,MARCUS,That's too many.
145801,L112601,u4258,m284,FRANK,Three legs.
145802,L112600,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"What's that, Frank?"
145803,L112599,u4258,m284,FRANK,It's coming.  Hold her down.
145804,L112582,u4258,m284,FRANK,What's wrong.
145805,L112581,u4262,m284,MARCUS,Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
145806,L112574,u4258,m284,FRANK,"I need a drink, that's all."
145807,L112573,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift."
145808,L112570,u4258,m284,FRANK,"She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me."
145809,L112569,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me."
145810,L112568,u4258,m284,FRANK,"She's no whore, Marcus."
145811,L112567,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you."
145812,L112562,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad."
145813,L112561,u4258,m284,FRANK,What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
145814,L112560,u4262,m284,MARCUS,Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
145815,L112532,u4258,m284,FRANK,Thanks.
145816,L112531,u4262,m284,MARCUS,Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
145817,L112517,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"God help us, he's hungry too."
145818,L112516,u4258,m284,FRANK,I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
145819,L112515,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought."
145820,L112514,u4258,m284,FRANK,She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
145821,L112513,u4262,m284,MARCUS,Who's that?
145822,L112495,u4258,m284,FRANK,Make a left here. I want to stop.
145823,L112494,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him."
145824,L112493,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story."
145825,L112492,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?"
145826,L112464,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back."
145827,L112463,u4258,m284,FRANK,He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
145828,L112452,u4262,m284,MARCUS,She loves me the way no woman ever has.
145829,L112451,u4258,m284,FRANK,Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
145830,L112450,u4262,m284,MARCUS,She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
145831,L112447,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here."
145832,L112446,u4258,m284,FRANK,I think the worst is over.
145833,L112445,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?"
145834,L112444,u4258,m284,FRANK,The ghosts--
145835,L112443,u4262,m284,MARCUS,Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
145836,L112442,u4258,m284,FRANK,The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
145837,L112441,u4262,m284,MARCUS,"My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?"
145838,L112932,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
145839,L112931,u4258,m284,FRANK,Where's Burke?
145840,L112930,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,Crazy fucker.
145841,L112929,u4258,m284,FRANK,No.
145842,L112928,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
145843,L112927,u4258,m284,FRANK,Last show of the night.
145844,L112853,u4258,m284,FRANK,A medical miracle.
145845,L112852,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,"That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?"
145846,L112851,u4258,m284,FRANK,"What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?"
145847,L112850,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
145848,L112849,u4258,m284,FRANK,How many times have you shocked him tonight?
145849,L112848,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,You can't believe how much he's improved.
145850,L112614,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity."
145851,L112613,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,"Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?"
145852,L112490,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,"I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone."
145853,L112489,u4258,m284,FRANK,The family know?
145854,L112488,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
145855,L112487,u4258,m284,FRANK,What do you think?
145856,L112486,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,"Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin."
145857,L112485,u4258,m284,FRANK,"That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone."
145858,L112240,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,"No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks."
145859,L112239,u4258,m284,FRANK,He one of them?
145860,L112232,u4259,m284,HAZMAT,"I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food."
145861,L112231,u4258,m284,FRANK,He got better.
145862,L112952,u4258,m284,FRANK,Yes.
145863,L112951,u4266,m284,ROSE/MARY,Would you like to come in?
145864,L112950,u4266,m284,ROSE/MARY,You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
145865,L112949,u4258,m284,FRANK,I'm sorry.
145866,L112948,u4266,m284,ROSE/MARY,He was tough. You did all you could.
145867,L112947,u4258,m284,FRANK,He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
145868,L112946,u4266,m284,ROSE/MARY,How can that be? He was getting better.
145869,L112945,u4258,m284,FRANK,"He's dead, Rose. Your father passed."
145870,L112923,u4267,m284,WALLS,You're crazy.
145871,L112922,u4258,m284,FRANK,"We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!"
145872,L112921,u4267,m284,WALLS,Frank!
145873,L112920,u4258,m284,FRANK,Do it!
145874,L112919,u4267,m284,WALLS,Frank!
145875,L112918,u4258,m284,FRANK,Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
145876,L112898,u4258,m284,FRANK,You learn that in the army?
145877,L112897,u4267,m284,WALLS,"Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better."
145878,L112896,u4258,m284,FRANK,That's ridiculous.
145879,L112895,u4267,m284,WALLS,"If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him."
145880,L112894,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Okay, whatta I do?"
145881,L112893,u4267,m284,WALLS,"Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--"
145882,L112892,u4267,m284,WALLS,"Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again."
145883,L112891,u4258,m284,FRANK,He's crazy. He can't help it.
145884,L112890,u4267,m284,WALLS,"This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term ""menace to society"" was made up for him."
145885,L112887,u4267,m284,WALLS,Let me think.
145886,L112886,u4258,m284,FRANK,"What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom."
145887,L112885,u4267,m284,WALLS,"You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy."
145888,L112884,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Destruction, distraction. I feel the need."
145889,L112883,u4267,m284,WALLS,Why?
145890,L112882,u4258,m284,FRANK,I don't know--let's break some windows.
145891,L112881,u4267,m284,WALLS,What do you want to break?
145892,L112880,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something."
145893,L112879,u4258,m284,FRANK,"That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die."
145894,L112878,u4267,m284,WALLS,Who with?
145895,L112877,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Let's get in a fight, then."
145896,L112876,u4267,m284,WALLS,You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
145897,L112875,u4258,m284,FRANK,"C'mon, Tom, pick up a job."
145898,L112873,u4267,m284,WALLS,"C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!"
145899,L112872,u4258,m284,FRANK,As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
145900,L112871,u4267,m284,WALLS,"Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!"
145901,L112823,u4267,m284,WALLS,I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
145902,L112822,u4258,m284,FRANK,How's he doing?
145903,L112821,u4267,m284,WALLS,I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
145904,L112820,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then."
145905,L112819,u4267,m284,WALLS,"Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out."
145906,L112809,u4258,m284,FRANK,Better bring it all.
145907,L112808,u4267,m284,WALLS,Whadda we bring?
145908,L112803,u4267,m284,WALLS,"That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it."
145909,L112802,u4258,m284,FRANK,It's early for him.
145910,L112801,u4267,m284,WALLS,Mr. Oh.
145911,L112796,u4258,m284,FRANK,I never felt better in my life.
145912,L112795,u4267,m284,WALLS,You okay?
145913,L112794,u4258,m284,FRANK,I've taken that into consideration.
145914,L112793,u4267,m284,WALLS,The brakes are shot.
145915,L112792,u4258,m284,FRANK,"I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself."
145916,L112791,u4267,m284,WALLS,Whatja doing?
145917,L112790,u4258,m284,FRANK,"C'mon, Tom. The city's burning."
145918,L112789,u4267,m284,WALLS,Where you going?
145919,L112773,u4267,m284,WALLS,Look out!
145920,L112772,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?"
145921,L112768,u4267,m284,WALLS,"Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto."
145922,L112767,u4258,m284,FRANK,"The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital."
145923,L112766,u4267,m284,WALLS,Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
145924,L112765,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso."
145925,L112764,u4267,m284,WALLS,"Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives."
145926,L112763,u4258,m284,FRANK,Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
145927,L112762,u4267,m284,WALLS,"Yeah. Great, isn't it?"
145928,L112761,u4258,m284,FRANK,"These are hard times, Tom."
145929,L112760,u4267,m284,WALLS,"Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets."
145930,L112759,u4258,m284,FRANK,"I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got."
145931,L112372,u4267,m284,WALLS,"No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid."
145932,L112371,u4258,m284,FRANK,"It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering."
145933,L112713,u4258,m284,FRANK,No way!
145934,L112712,u4261,m284,LARRY,Stomach again.
145935,L112711,u4258,m284,FRANK,One more time!
145936,L112710,u4261,m284,LARRY,You're in the stomach! Let me try.
145937,L112705,u4258,m284,FRANK,You sure?
145938,L112704,u4261,m284,LARRY,You're in the stomach!
145939,L112367,u4258,m284,FRANK,Used to be my partner.
145940,L112366,u4261,m284,LARRY,"Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker."
145941,L112356,u4258,m284,FRANK,You really think so?
145942,L112355,u4261,m284,LARRY,He's crazy.
145943,L112346,u4261,m284,LARRY,"Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots."
145944,L112345,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?"
145945,L112344,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Yeah, you're right."
145946,L112343,u4261,m284,LARRY,"You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here."
145947,L112342,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight."
145948,L112341,u4261,m284,LARRY,"You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that."
145949,L112340,u4258,m284,FRANK,"I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night."
145950,L112337,u4261,m284,LARRY,"Relax, will you."
145951,L112336,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls."
145952,L112315,u4258,m284,FRANK,Faster!
145953,L112314,u4261,m284,LARRY,Faster! God!
145954,L112306,u4261,m284,LARRY,He's drunk.
145955,L112305,u4258,m284,FRANK,Well why didn't you say so?
145956,L112301,u4261,m284,LARRY,"Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh."
145957,L112300,u4258,m284,FRANK,They'll just keep calling.
145958,L112299,u4261,m284,LARRY,It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
145959,L112298,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk."
145960,L112291,u4261,m284,LARRY,It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
145961,L112290,u4258,m284,FRANK,Mr. Oh.
145962,L112285,u4261,m284,LARRY,You're burned out.
145963,L112284,u4258,m284,FRANK,"Don't push it, Larry."
145964,L112283,u4261,m284,LARRY,"That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank."
145965,L112282,u4258,m284,FRANK,You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
145966,L112279,u4261,m284,LARRY,You know what. The radio.
145967,L112278,u4258,m284,FRANK,What?
145968,L112277,u4261,m284,LARRY,Turn it off.
145969,L112273,u4261,m284,LARRY,"Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on."
145970,L112272,u4258,m284,FRANK,I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
145971,L112271,u4261,m284,LARRY,"Oh yeah, you don't eat food."
145972,L112270,u4258,m284,FRANK,I'm not hungry.
145973,L112269,u4261,m284,LARRY,"I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?"
145974,L112268,u4258,m284,FRANK,What?
145975,L112267,u4261,m284,LARRY,Oh no!--I just remembered.
145976,L112263,u4261,m284,LARRY,Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
145977,L112262,u4258,m284,FRANK,I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
145978,L112261,u4261,m284,LARRY,The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
145979,L112205,u4261,m284,LARRY,No shit.
145980,L112204,u4258,m284,FRANK,No we can't. He's got a pulse.
145981,L112297,u4261,m284,LARRY,Ten-four.  Don't go. Not this time.
145982,L112296,u4265,m284,RADIO DISPATCHER,"Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh."
145983,L112295,u4261,m284,LARRY,"Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it.  You can do that for me at least.  Three Zebra."
145984,L112294,u4265,m284,RADIO DISPATCHER,Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra. You're going out of service in two seconds.
145985,L112293,u4261,m284,LARRY,Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
145986,L112292,u4265,m284,RADIO DISPATCHER,Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
145987,L112289,u4261,m284,LARRY,No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
145988,L112288,u4265,m284,RADIO DISPATCHER,"Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks."
145989,L112287,u4261,m284,LARRY,"You see, he's giving it to us anyway."
145990,L112286,u4265,m284,RADIO DISPATCHER,"One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you."
145991,L114090,u4268,m285,AARON,Why?
145992,L114089,u4281,m285,TOM,"If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know."
145993,L114088,u4268,m285,AARON,Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
145994,L114087,u4281,m285,TOM,It's nice to see you.
145995,L114078,u4281,m285,TOM,Are you any closer to a decision?
145996,L114077,u4268,m285,AARON,He excels at gratitude.
145997,L114068,u4281,m285,TOM,I'll see you back at the hotel.
145998,L114067,u4268,m285,AARON,Okay.
145999,L114066,u4281,m285,TOM,I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
146000,L114065,u4268,m285,AARON,I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
146001,L114061,u4281,m285,TOM,"Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?"
146002,L114060,u4268,m285,AARON,Hi.
146003,L113964,u4268,m285,AARON,"No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long."
146004,L113963,u4281,m285,TOM,You know what I...
146005,L113962,u4281,m285,TOM,I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
146006,L113961,u4268,m285,AARON,This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
146007,L113960,u4268,m285,AARON,No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
146008,L113959,u4281,m285,TOM,Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
146009,L113958,u4268,m285,AARON,"Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?"
146010,L113957,u4281,m285,TOM,"Hold it down, okay?"
146011,L113956,u4268,m285,AARON,"It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it."
146012,L113955,u4281,m285,TOM,I don't think so.
146013,L113954,u4268,m285,AARON,London.  That's a promotion!
146014,L113953,u4281,m285,TOM,London.
146015,L113952,u4268,m285,AARON,"Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?"
146016,L113951,u4281,m285,TOM,You packing up tonight?
146017,L113946,u4281,m285,TOM,Why?  What did they do to you?
146018,L113945,u4268,m285,AARON,Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
146019,L113944,u4281,m285,TOM,They booted me out of Washington.
146020,L113943,u4268,m285,AARON,What did they do with you?
146021,L113865,u4268,m285,AARON,I'll put her on.
146022,L113864,u4281,m285,TOM,No.  Don't worry about it.
146023,L113863,u4268,m285,AARON,"Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry."
146024,L113862,u4281,m285,TOM,Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
146025,L113701,u4268,m285,AARON,The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
146026,L113700,u4281,m285,TOM,You were smokin' toward the end there.
146027,L113696,u4281,m285,TOM,And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
146028,L113695,u4268,m285,AARON,"Oh, God, no!"
146029,L113694,u4281,m285,TOM,"Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?"
146030,L113693,u4268,m285,AARON,No?
146031,L113692,u4281,m285,TOM,No.  No.
146032,L113688,u4281,m285,TOM,I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
146033,L113687,u4268,m285,AARON,It's not loaded.
146034,L113686,u4281,m285,TOM,No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
146035,L113685,u4268,m285,AARON,Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
146036,L113684,u4281,m285,TOM,Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
146037,L113683,u4268,m285,AARON,I don't like being handled.
146038,L113681,u4281,m285,TOM,Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
146039,L113680,u4268,m285,AARON,What?
146040,L113679,u4281,m285,TOM,Wait.
146041,L113678,u4268,m285,AARON,It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
146042,L113677,u4281,m285,TOM,We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
146043,L113676,u4268,m285,AARON,"This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently."
146044,L113645,u4268,m285,AARON,Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
146045,L113644,u4281,m285,TOM,What's wrong with it?
146046,L113643,u4268,m285,AARON,I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
146047,L113599,u4281,m285,TOM,"Fifty, right?"
146048,L113598,u4268,m285,AARON,I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
146049,L113597,u4281,m285,TOM,"You're feeling good, aren't you?"
146050,L113596,u4268,m285,AARON,There are only ten.
146051,L113595,u4281,m285,TOM,Yes.
146052,L113594,u4268,m285,AARON,Okay.
146053,L113593,u4281,m285,TOM,"Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet."
146054,L113592,u4268,m285,AARON,Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
146055,L113591,u4268,m285,AARON,"We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?"
146056,L113590,u4281,m285,TOM,"Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd..."
146057,L113589,u4268,m285,AARON,Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
146058,L113588,u4281,m285,TOM,Never to pretend to know more than I did.
146059,L113587,u4268,m285,AARON,And the rule was...
146060,L113586,u4281,m285,TOM,I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
146061,L113585,u4268,m285,AARON,"Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?"
146062,L113584,u4281,m285,TOM,Shut up a second...
146063,L113583,u4268,m285,AARON,You have the job you have...
146064,L113582,u4281,m285,TOM,I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
146065,L113581,u4268,m285,AARON,You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
146066,L113580,u4268,m285,AARON,"Oh, stop it."
146067,L113579,u4281,m285,TOM,You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
146068,L113578,u4268,m285,AARON,Keep it to yourself.
146069,L113577,u4281,m285,TOM,"Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?"
146070,L113576,u4268,m285,AARON,How <u>you</u> doing?
146071,L113574,u4268,m285,AARON,You've made my dreams silly.
146072,L113573,u4281,m285,TOM,What did I do to you?
146073,L113572,u4268,m285,AARON,Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
146074,L113571,u4281,m285,TOM,You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
146075,L113570,u4268,m285,AARON,Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
146076,L113569,u4281,m285,TOM,"Hi, Aaron...What's doing?"
146077,L113468,u4268,m285,AARON,"Nice, Jane."
146078,L113467,u4281,m285,TOM,"...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'."
146079,L113335,u4268,m285,AARON,You write this?
146080,L113334,u4281,m285,TOM,One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
146081,L113237,u4268,m285,AARON,Yeah.
146082,L113236,u4281,m285,TOM,Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
146083,L113164,u4281,m285,TOM,"You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do."
146084,L113163,u4268,m285,AARON,"Shit, shit, shit..."
146085,L113261,u4268,m285,AARON,"Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it, Ellen.  Let's call security and get him out."
146086,L113260,u4272,m285,BUDDY,Ravenous homosexual.
146087,L113259,u4268,m285,AARON,Which would you prefer?
146088,L113258,u4272,m285,BUDDY,I don't like the word gay.
146089,L113257,u4268,m285,AARON,You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
146090,L113254,u4272,m285,BUDDY,"Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry."
146091,L113253,u4268,m285,AARON,Eventually rising to...
146092,L113252,u4272,m285,BUDDY,I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
146093,L113251,u4268,m285,AARON,You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
146094,L113250,u4272,m285,BUDDY,Yes.
146095,L113249,u4268,m285,AARON,I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
146096,L113248,u4272,m285,BUDDY,Yes.
146097,L113247,u4268,m285,AARON,That's your full name?
146098,L113246,u4272,m285,BUDDY,Yes.
146099,L113245,u4268,m285,AARON,It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
146100,L114098,u4268,m285,AARON,Well -- my wife got this new job...
146101,L114097,u4278,m285,JANE,"I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?"
146102,L114096,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing."
146103,L114095,u4268,m285,AARON,So who's the guy?
146104,L114081,u4278,m285,JANE,I'm going to take it.
146105,L114080,u4268,m285,AARON,Really?
146106,L114079,u4278,m285,JANE,I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
146107,L113993,u4268,m285,AARON,"I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?"
146108,L113992,u4278,m285,JANE,"You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?"
146109,L113991,u4268,m285,AARON,"I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies."
146110,L113990,u4278,m285,JANE,Yes.
146111,L113989,u4268,m285,AARON,"Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations."
146112,L113988,u4278,m285,JANE,You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
146113,L113987,u4268,m285,AARON,Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
146114,L113986,u4278,m285,JANE,"I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?"
146115,L113985,u4268,m285,AARON,Let's go...
146116,L113984,u4278,m285,JANE,You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
146117,L113983,u4268,m285,AARON,"Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago."
146118,L113982,u4278,m285,JANE,Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
146119,L113981,u4268,m285,AARON,"Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher."
146120,L113980,u4278,m285,JANE,Why not try it for a few weeks?
146121,L113979,u4278,m285,JANE,"I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please."
146122,L113978,u4268,m285,AARON,Speaking.
146123,L113977,u4278,m285,JANE,"Bastard, sneak, quitter."
146124,L113861,u4268,m285,AARON,Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
146125,L113860,u4278,m285,JANE,Don't say anything about anything.
146126,L113849,u4278,m285,JANE,"Sit down, stop."
146127,L113848,u4268,m285,AARON,I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
146128,L113847,u4268,m285,AARON,"Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead."
146129,L113846,u4278,m285,JANE,You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
146130,L113845,u4268,m285,AARON,"Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told."
146131,L113844,u4278,m285,JANE,How?
146132,L113843,u4268,m285,AARON,No.  You know that I'm not.
146133,L113842,u4278,m285,JANE,I think you're the Devil.
146134,L113841,u4268,m285,AARON,"What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women."
146135,L113840,u4278,m285,JANE,This isn't friendship.
146136,L113839,u4268,m285,AARON,"I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil."
146137,L113838,u4278,m285,JANE,Yeah -- being a basket case.
146138,L113837,u4268,m285,AARON,You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
146139,L113836,u4278,m285,JANE,"Yes, I guess.  Yes."
146140,L113835,u4268,m285,AARON,"Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?"
146141,L113834,u4268,m285,AARON,Let me think a second.  It's tough.
146142,L113833,u4278,m285,JANE,What?
146143,L113832,u4268,m285,AARON,Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
146144,L113831,u4278,m285,JANE,This is important to me.
146145,L113830,u4268,m285,AARON,Don't go.
146146,L113829,u4268,m285,AARON,No!!!!!
146147,L113828,u4278,m285,JANE,I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
146148,L113827,u4268,m285,AARON,"Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?"
146149,L113826,u4278,m285,JANE,I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
146150,L113825,u4278,m285,JANE,I have to be somewhere.
146151,L113824,u4268,m285,AARON,I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
146152,L113823,u4278,m285,JANE,"If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?"
146153,L113822,u4268,m285,AARON,"No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack."
146154,L113821,u4278,m285,JANE,There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
146155,L113820,u4268,m285,AARON,I'm not kidding.
146156,L113819,u4278,m285,JANE,Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
146157,L113818,u4268,m285,AARON,People phoned in.
146158,L113817,u4278,m285,JANE,"What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it..."
146159,L113816,u4268,m285,AARON,"It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?"
146160,L113815,u4278,m285,JANE,"Aaron, will you tell me?"
146161,L113814,u4268,m285,AARON,I lost six pounds...
146162,L113813,u4278,m285,JANE,Then what was good about it?
146163,L113812,u4268,m285,AARON,No.
146164,L113811,u4278,m285,JANE,Do others feel that you did well?
146165,L113810,u4268,m285,AARON,No.
146166,L113809,u4278,m285,JANE,Do you feel good about it?
146167,L113808,u4268,m285,AARON,Define your terms.
146168,L113807,u4278,m285,JANE,Did it really go well?
146169,L113806,u4268,m285,AARON,Then it went well.
146170,L113805,u4278,m285,JANE,No.
146171,L113804,u4268,m285,AARON,You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
146172,L113803,u4278,m285,JANE,How'd it go?
146173,L113724,u4278,m285,JANE,You too.
146174,L113723,u4268,m285,AARON,"Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight."
146175,L113722,u4278,m285,JANE,"Okay, great -- good luck."
146176,L113721,u4268,m285,AARON,"<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment."
146177,L113720,u4278,m285,JANE,I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
146178,L113719,u4268,m285,AARON,"Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio."
146179,L113718,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there."
146180,L113717,u4268,m285,AARON,Yes.
146181,L113716,u4278,m285,JANE,As good as humanly possible.
146182,L113715,u4268,m285,AARON,Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
146183,L113711,u4278,m285,JANE,It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
146184,L113710,u4268,m285,AARON,Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
146185,L113709,u4278,m285,JANE,I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
146186,L113707,u4268,m285,AARON,Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
146187,L113706,u4278,m285,JANE,Did you bring your grey suit?
146188,L113705,u4268,m285,AARON,I didn't know you were going with him.
146189,L113704,u4278,m285,JANE,"Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there..."
146190,L113548,u4268,m285,AARON,"They're not that dumb, after all."
146191,L113547,u4278,m285,JANE,Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
146192,L113546,u4278,m285,JANE,A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
146193,L113545,u4268,m285,AARON,"Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?"
146194,L113514,u4268,m285,AARON,Good.
146195,L113513,u4278,m285,JANE,Yes.
146196,L113512,u4268,m285,AARON,Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
146197,L113511,u4278,m285,JANE,You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
146198,L113510,u4268,m285,AARON,"Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner."
146199,L113509,u4278,m285,JANE,Sounds like you may be on to something.
146200,L113508,u4268,m285,AARON,"I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why."
146201,L113507,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, whatever you think."
146202,L113466,u4268,m285,AARON,You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.
146203,L113465,u4278,m285,JANE,Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
146204,L113464,u4268,m285,AARON,"Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange."
146205,L113459,u4278,m285,JANE,"Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes."
146206,L113458,u4268,m285,AARON,I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
146207,L113412,u4278,m285,JANE,"I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you."
146208,L113411,u4268,m285,AARON,Watch? --
146209,L113410,u4278,m285,JANE,I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
146210,L113409,u4268,m285,AARON,What happened?
146211,L113337,u4268,m285,AARON,Not because you have to.
146212,L113336,u4278,m285,JANE,I write for you sometimes.
146213,L113205,u4268,m285,AARON,Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
146214,L113204,u4278,m285,JANE,To the pan of the supplies boxes --
146215,L113203,u4268,m285,AARON,We can cut back at the end.
146216,L113202,u4278,m285,JANE,Of course.
146217,L113201,u4268,m285,AARON,Did you shoot their boots?
146218,L113200,u4278,m285,JANE,Okay.  Great line at the end.
146219,L113188,u4278,m285,JANE,You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
146220,L113187,u4268,m285,AARON,Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
146221,L113186,u4278,m285,JANE,"If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in."
146222,L113185,u4268,m285,AARON,I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
146223,L113157,u4278,m285,JANE,"Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?"
146224,L113156,u4268,m285,AARON,Eleven and a half.
146225,L113155,u4278,m285,JANE,Nine seconds.
146226,L113106,u4278,m285,JANE,You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
146227,L113105,u4268,m285,AARON,They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
146228,L113099,u4278,m285,JANE,Call if you get weird.
146229,L113098,u4268,m285,AARON,Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
146230,L113097,u4278,m285,JANE,Good night.
146231,L113096,u4268,m285,AARON,I'd give anything if that were true.
146232,L113095,u4278,m285,JANE,This conversation is not worthy of you.
146233,L113094,u4268,m285,AARON,Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
146234,L113093,u4278,m285,JANE,Sure.
146235,L113092,u4268,m285,AARON,Okay.  Let's do me.
146236,L113091,u4268,m285,AARON,Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
146237,L113090,u4278,m285,JANE,Why do you say that?
146238,L113089,u4268,m285,AARON,"He must have been great-looking, right?"
146239,L113019,u4278,m285,JANE,No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
146240,L113018,u4268,m285,AARON,Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
146241,L112996,u4268,m285,AARON,"Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>]."
146242,L112995,u4278,m285,JANE,A half hour in the lobby.
146243,L112994,u4268,m285,AARON,"Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully."
146244,L112993,u4278,m285,JANE,At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
146245,L112992,u4268,m285,AARON,"Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them."
146246,L113007,u4268,m285,AARON,"In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money."
146247,L113006,u4273,m285,CAMERAMAN,I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
146248,L113005,u4268,m285,AARON,"Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay."
146249,L113003,u4268,m285,AARON,"In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He..."
146250,L113002,u4273,m285,CAMERAMAN,Okay.
146251,L113001,u4268,m285,AARON,No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
146252,L113000,u4273,m285,CAMERAMAN,In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
146253,L112999,u4268,m285,AARON,"It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it."
146254,L112998,u4273,m285,CAMERAMAN,Your hair's a little funny.
146255,L112997,u4268,m285,AARON,Ready.
146256,L113950,u4268,m285,AARON,So I quit.
146257,L113949,u4274,m285,ERNIE,The cost-efficient reporter.
146258,L113948,u4268,m285,AARON,They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
146259,L113947,u4274,m285,ERNIE,It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
146260,L113675,u4268,m285,AARON,Thanks.
146261,L113674,u4274,m285,ERNIE,I understand.  I'll go with you.
146262,L113673,u4268,m285,AARON,Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
146263,L113672,u4274,m285,ERNIE,It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
146264,L113671,u4268,m285,AARON,Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
146265,L113670,u4274,m285,ERNIE,Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
146266,L113669,u4268,m285,AARON,Do it then.
146267,L113668,u4274,m285,ERNIE,I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
146268,L113667,u4268,m285,AARON,Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
146269,L113666,u4274,m285,ERNIE,All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
146270,L113665,u4268,m285,AARON,"Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me."
146271,L113664,u4274,m285,ERNIE,"I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it."
146272,L113663,u4268,m285,AARON,Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
146273,L113662,u4274,m285,ERNIE,"Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to..."
146274,L113661,u4274,m285,ERNIE,Upper management thinks you're dull.
146275,L113660,u4268,m285,AARON,"Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness."
146276,L113659,u4274,m285,ERNIE,Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
146277,L113658,u4268,m285,AARON,Wipe me out?
146278,L113657,u4274,m285,ERNIE,We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
146279,L113656,u4268,m285,AARON,Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
146280,L113655,u4274,m285,ERNIE,I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
146281,L113654,u4274,m285,ERNIE,Yeah --
146282,L113653,u4268,m285,AARON,Outside?
146283,L113652,u4274,m285,ERNIE,"Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?"
146284,L113398,u4268,m285,AARON,I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
146285,L113397,u4274,m285,ERNIE,Stop it.
146286,L113396,u4268,m285,AARON,That's it.  I resign as of now.
146287,L113382,u4268,m285,AARON,You didn't say anything to her?
146288,L113381,u4274,m285,ERNIE,"I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again."
146289,L113174,u4268,m285,AARON,I'm gonna go look at it again.
146290,L113173,u4274,m285,ERNIE,I saw the smile -- good piece.
146291,L113021,u4277,m285,J.D.,Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
146292,L113020,u4268,m285,AARON,All this business of war -- do you get scared?
146293,L113016,u4268,m285,AARON,It depends on how big a news day it is.
146294,L113015,u4277,m285,J.D.,Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
146295,L113014,u4268,m285,AARON,How long has it been since you've been home.
146296,L113013,u4277,m285,J.D.,Move away from me.
146297,L113012,u4268,m285,AARON,We came from Washington.
146298,L113011,u4277,m285,J.D.,No.
146299,L113010,u4268,m285,AARON,Just a few questions?
146300,L113361,u4270,m285,BLAIR,"My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you."
146301,L113360,u4268,m285,AARON,No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
146302,L113359,u4270,m285,BLAIR,You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
146303,L113358,u4268,m285,AARON,"Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division."
146304,L113357,u4270,m285,BLAIR,"Goodbye, Paul."
146305,L113167,u4268,m285,AARON,"Oh, come on -- tell us another."
146306,L113166,u4270,m285,BLAIR,I was a little nervous there for a minute.
146307,L113152,u4270,m285,BLAIR,We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
146308,L113151,u4268,m285,AARON,"Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal."
146309,L113146,u4268,m285,AARON,"Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines."
146310,L113145,u4270,m285,BLAIR,Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
146311,L113144,u4268,m285,AARON,What is she shooting?
146312,L113143,u4270,m285,BLAIR,Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
146313,L113916,u4280,m285,PAUL,You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
146314,L113915,u4269,m285,BILL,This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
146315,L113911,u4269,m285,BILL,"If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization."
146316,L113910,u4280,m285,PAUL,Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
146317,L113909,u4269,m285,BILL,I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
146318,L113908,u4280,m285,PAUL,Almost immediately.
146319,L113907,u4269,m285,BILL,"Just when do you start, telling people?"
146320,L113234,u4269,m285,BILL,I'll speak to you soon
146321,L113233,u4278,m285,JANE,"No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here."
146322,L113232,u4269,m285,BILL,"Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?"
146323,L113231,u4278,m285,JANE,Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
146324,L113229,u4269,m285,BILL,"Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect."
146325,L113228,u4278,m285,JANE,But thanks.
146326,L113227,u4278,m285,JANE,Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
146327,L113226,u4269,m285,BILL,"Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York."
146328,L113225,u4278,m285,JANE,Yes.
146329,L113224,u4269,m285,BILL,Jane?
146330,L113932,u4278,m285,JANE,It's started.
146331,L113931,u4270,m285,BLAIR,"They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up."
146332,L113897,u4270,m285,BLAIR,I spent a fortune on this.
146333,L113896,u4278,m285,JANE,"What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week."
146334,L113550,u4278,m285,JANE,"No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky."
146335,L113549,u4270,m285,BLAIR,Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
146336,L113457,u4278,m285,JANE,Yes?
146337,L113456,u4270,m285,BLAIR,It's Aaron.
146338,L113419,u4270,m285,BLAIR,Yes.
146339,L113418,u4278,m285,JANE,Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
146340,L113417,u4270,m285,BLAIR,And Bobbie says...
146341,L113416,u4278,m285,JANE,Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
146342,L113344,u4270,m285,BLAIR,I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
146343,L113343,u4278,m285,JANE,"Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it."
146344,L113240,u4278,m285,JANE,I'll never tell.
146345,L113239,u4270,m285,BLAIR,What did he say?
146346,L113126,u4278,m285,JANE,"Yes, there is."
146347,L113125,u4270,m285,BLAIR,I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
146348,L113124,u4278,m285,JANE,I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
146349,L113123,u4270,m285,BLAIR,You don't have time.  Not a chance.
146350,L113303,u4278,m285,JANE,"Bobbie, please."
146351,L113302,u4271,m285,BOBBIE,"You know, I like Tom, because hi..."
146352,L113295,u4278,m285,JANE,"Right there, Bobbie."
146353,L113294,u4271,m285,BOBBIE,Because...
146354,L113293,u4278,m285,JANE,No stop where he's all besieged.
146355,L113292,u4271,m285,BOBBIE,Do you want him all the way to the car?
146356,L113149,u4278,m285,JANE,Just a two-second dissolve.
146357,L113148,u4271,m285,BOBBIE,Should I...
146358,L113147,u4278,m285,JANE,"Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell."
146359,L113118,u4278,m285,JANE,Let me hear it!
146360,L113117,u4271,m285,BOBBIE,He said something about...
146361,L113116,u4278,m285,JANE,Play back the last line...
146362,L113112,u4278,m285,JANE,"Please, Bobbie, we're pushing."
146363,L113111,u4271,m285,BOBBIE,We could...
146364,L113110,u4278,m285,JANE,"Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'"
146365,L113439,u4272,m285,BUDDY,"Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'"
146366,L113438,u4281,m285,TOM,I'll speak to you.
146367,L113437,u4272,m285,BUDDY,...good-bye then.
146368,L113436,u4281,m285,TOM,"Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work."
146369,L113435,u4272,m285,BUDDY,"Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone."
146370,L113434,u4281,m285,TOM,No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
146371,L113433,u4272,m285,BUDDY,"Look, I can start up with him again if you really..."
146372,L113432,u4281,m285,TOM,Oh.
146373,L113431,u4272,m285,BUDDY,I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
146374,L113430,u4281,m285,TOM,"Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?"
146375,L113429,u4272,m285,BUDDY,Anchor?
146376,L113428,u4281,m285,TOM,Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
146377,L113427,u4272,m285,BUDDY,Is everything all right?
146378,L113326,u4272,m285,BUDDY,Okay.
146379,L113325,u4281,m285,TOM,"Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore."
146380,L113323,u4281,m285,TOM,What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
146381,L113322,u4272,m285,BUDDY,"Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?"
146382,L113321,u4281,m285,TOM,No.  Really...don't worry about it.
146383,L113320,u4272,m285,BUDDY,What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
146384,L113319,u4281,m285,TOM,That's okay.
146385,L113318,u4272,m285,BUDDY,I wish it were you giving the story.
146386,L113317,u4281,m285,TOM,Nobody else had it.
146387,L113316,u4272,m285,BUDDY,"Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source."
146388,L113308,u4272,m285,BUDDY,I see the change in you -- I see it.
146389,L113307,u4281,m285,TOM,Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
146390,L113306,u4272,m285,BUDDY,"Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work."
146391,L113305,u4281,m285,TOM,"Thanks a lot, Buddy."
146392,L113304,u4272,m285,BUDDY,...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
146393,L113285,u4272,m285,BUDDY,"My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you."
146394,L113284,u4281,m285,TOM,Yes.  How do you know?
146395,L113283,u4272,m285,BUDDY,"Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?"
146396,L113282,u4281,m285,TOM,What?
146397,L113281,u4272,m285,BUDDY,Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
146398,L113280,u4281,m285,TOM,I really have to go.
146399,L113279,u4272,m285,BUDDY,One's enough.
146400,L113278,u4281,m285,TOM,No...no.
146401,L113277,u4272,m285,BUDDY,"I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?"
146402,L113276,u4281,m285,TOM,Yes.  That's right.
146403,L113275,u4272,m285,BUDDY,Bad manners.
146404,L113274,u4281,m285,TOM,"I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still..."
146405,L113267,u4272,m285,BUDDY,You talked me into it.
146406,L113266,u4281,m285,TOM,Follow me.
146407,L113265,u4272,m285,BUDDY,How do I get out of here?
146408,L113264,u4281,m285,TOM,"No, I don't think so."
146409,L113263,u4272,m285,BUDDY,They're not really going to call security are they?
146410,L113893,u4282,m285,WIFE,"Okay, sweetie."
146411,L113892,u4274,m285,ERNIE,"Bye, sweetie."
146412,L113891,u4282,m285,WIFE,I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
146413,L113890,u4274,m285,ERNIE,No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
146414,L113889,u4282,m285,WIFE,"How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans."
146415,L113888,u4274,m285,ERNIE,They fired me.
146416,L113887,u4282,m285,WIFE,What?
146417,L113884,u4282,m285,WIFE,It's Paul.
146418,L113883,u4274,m285,ERNIE,Tell me I'm on the way in.
146419,L113882,u4282,m285,WIFE,"Ernie, they're calling from work."
146420,L112987,u4275,m285,FATHER,Finish quickly.  I don't want you getting obsessive about these things.  Good night.
146421,L112986,u4278,m285,JANE,Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
146422,L112985,u4275,m285,FATHER,You don't have to finish tonight.
146423,L112984,u4278,m285,JANE,I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
146424,L112983,u4275,m285,FATHER,"Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep."
146425,L112981,u4275,m285,FATHER,Honey?...
146426,L112980,u4278,m285,JANE,...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
146427,L112970,u4281,m285,TOM,That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
146428,L112969,u4276,m285,GERALD,Would it help if I got you a tutor?
146429,L112968,u4281,m285,TOM,"Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?"
146430,L112967,u4281,m285,TOM,I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
146431,L112966,u4276,m285,GERALD,"Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?"
146432,L112965,u4281,m285,TOM,"I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete."
146433,L112964,u4281,m285,TOM,It's not.
146434,L112963,u4276,m285,GERALD,As long as that's your only problem you're...
146435,L112962,u4281,m285,TOM,Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
146436,L112961,u4276,m285,GERALD,"You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way."
146437,L112960,u4281,m285,TOM,"No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- ""Beat them off with a stick."""
146438,L112959,u4276,m285,GERALD,Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
146439,L112958,u4281,m285,TOM,"No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess."
146440,L112957,u4276,m285,GERALD,Go ahead.
146441,L112956,u4281,m285,TOM,I don't know.
146442,L112955,u4276,m285,GERALD,Why so glum?
146443,L112954,u4281,m285,TOM,No.  Not even you.
146444,L112953,u4276,m285,GERALD,"I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?"
146445,L113473,u4278,m285,JANE,Fill for a second.
146446,L113472,u4280,m285,PAUL,I had no idea she was this good.
146447,L113407,u4278,m285,JANE,"No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful."
146448,L113406,u4280,m285,PAUL,It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
146449,L113405,u4280,m285,PAUL,You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
146450,L113404,u4278,m285,JANE,It's not opinion.
146451,L113403,u4280,m285,PAUL,"Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree."
146452,L113402,u4278,m285,JANE,"Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that."
146453,L114086,u4281,m285,TOM,Okay...It's so good to see you.
146454,L114085,u4278,m285,JANE,"I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours."
146455,L114084,u4281,m285,TOM,"Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila."
146456,L114083,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot."
146457,L114082,u4281,m285,TOM,What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
146458,L114075,u4278,m285,JANE,I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
146459,L114074,u4281,m285,TOM,A picnic?
146460,L114073,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes."
146461,L114049,u4278,m285,JANE,Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
146462,L114048,u4281,m285,TOM,Take it easy.
146463,L114047,u4278,m285,JANE,It's better when you let me say it.
146464,L114046,u4281,m285,TOM,Then you should stay here.
146465,L114045,u4278,m285,JANE,"It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that..."
146466,L114044,u4281,m285,TOM,You want to come?
146467,L114043,u4278,m285,JANE,"So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?"
146468,L114041,u4278,m285,JANE,It's okay.
146469,L114040,u4281,m285,TOM,"Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it."
146470,L114039,u4278,m285,JANE,You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
146471,L114038,u4281,m285,TOM,"What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think."
146472,L114037,u4278,m285,JANE,I knew what you meant.
146473,L114036,u4281,m285,TOM,"Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news."
146474,L114035,u4278,m285,JANE,I don't wan to discuss work.
146475,L114034,u4281,m285,TOM,You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
146476,L114033,u4278,m285,JANE,That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
146477,L114031,u4281,m285,TOM,I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.
146478,L114030,u4278,m285,JANE,It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
146479,L114029,u4281,m285,TOM,"This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket."
146480,L114028,u4278,m285,JANE,It just proves that the difference we have are...
146481,L114027,u4281,m285,TOM,"It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?"
146482,L114026,u4278,m285,JANE,Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
146483,L114025,u4281,m285,TOM,I got promoted for things like that.
146484,L114024,u4278,m285,JANE,It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
146485,L114023,u4281,m285,TOM,"Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane..."
146486,L114022,u4278,m285,JANE,"Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and..."
146487,L114021,u4281,m285,TOM,We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
146488,L114020,u4278,m285,JANE,Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
146489,L114019,u4281,m285,TOM,"I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?"
146490,L114018,u4278,m285,JANE,I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
146491,L114017,u4281,m285,TOM,Why?
146492,L114013,u4278,m285,JANE,You fucking...
146493,L114012,u4281,m285,TOM,Then give me a minute...
146494,L113975,u4278,m285,JANE,That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
146495,L113974,u4281,m285,TOM,That's yes?
146496,L113973,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal."
146497,L113972,u4281,m285,TOM,"Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this."
146498,L113971,u4278,m285,JANE,How can you say that to me?
146499,L113970,u4281,m285,TOM,"Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion."
146500,L113930,u4278,m285,JANE,That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
146501,L113929,u4281,m285,TOM,That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
146502,L113928,u4278,m285,JANE,What?
146503,L113927,u4281,m285,TOM,Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
146504,L113926,u4278,m285,JANE,No.  Did he really?
146505,L113925,u4281,m285,TOM,He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
146506,L113924,u4278,m285,JANE,I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
146507,L113877,u4278,m285,JANE,"Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night."
146508,L113876,u4281,m285,TOM,"Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule."
146509,L113875,u4278,m285,JANE,Good night??!
146510,L113874,u4281,m285,TOM,Okay.  Good night.
146511,L113873,u4278,m285,JANE,Yes.
146512,L113872,u4281,m285,TOM,Hello?
146513,L113871,u4281,m285,TOM,I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
146514,L113870,u4278,m285,JANE,Uh-huh.
146515,L113869,u4281,m285,TOM,I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
146516,L113868,u4278,m285,JANE,I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
146517,L113867,u4281,m285,TOM,No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
146518,L113866,u4278,m285,JANE,"Hi, again.  Sorry about..."
146519,L113858,u4281,m285,TOM,Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
146520,L113857,u4278,m285,JANE,"It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?"
146521,L113856,u4281,m285,TOM,I know.  I taped it.
146522,L113855,u4278,m285,JANE,I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
146523,L113854,u4281,m285,TOM,"Well, when?"
146524,L113853,u4278,m285,JANE,I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
146525,L113852,u4281,m285,TOM,Where are you?
146526,L113851,u4278,m285,JANE,Hi.  It's me.
146527,L113801,u4278,m285,JANE,"Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me."
146528,L113800,u4281,m285,TOM,It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
146529,L113799,u4278,m285,JANE,He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
146530,L113798,u4281,m285,TOM,Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
146531,L113797,u4278,m285,JANE,What happened?
146532,L113795,u4278,m285,JANE,No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
146533,L113794,u4281,m285,TOM,I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
146534,L113793,u4278,m285,JANE,I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
146535,L113790,u4278,m285,JANE,Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
146536,L113789,u4281,m285,TOM,That's not it.
146537,L113788,u4278,m285,JANE,"Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it."
146538,L113787,u4281,m285,TOM,What?
146539,L113786,u4278,m285,JANE,"Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons."
146540,L113785,u4281,m285,TOM,I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
146541,L113782,u4278,m285,JANE,"Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?"
146542,L113781,u4281,m285,TOM,Because you're nuts.
146543,L113780,u4278,m285,JANE,I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
146544,L113779,u4278,m285,JANE,This is hysterical.
146545,L113778,u4281,m285,TOM,You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
146546,L113777,u4278,m285,JANE,At least kiss me when you do that.
146547,L113776,u4278,m285,JANE,Well...
146548,L113775,u4281,m285,TOM,Why can't I let go of this woman?
146549,L113774,u4278,m285,JANE,Great.
146550,L113773,u4281,m285,TOM,You okay?
146551,L113754,u4278,m285,JANE,Uh-uh.
146552,L113753,u4281,m285,TOM,"You're not going to take off on me, are you?"
146553,L113751,u4278,m285,JANE,Good.  That's it...See you.
146554,L113750,u4281,m285,TOM,Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
146555,L113734,u4281,m285,TOM,Me!
146556,L113733,u4278,m285,JANE,Who?
146557,L113732,u4281,m285,TOM,It's incredible who's here.
146558,L113649,u4281,m285,TOM,Yeah.
146559,L113648,u4278,m285,JANE,It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
146560,L113647,u4281,m285,TOM,So what did you think?
146561,L113633,u4281,m285,TOM,I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
146562,L113632,u4278,m285,JANE,"So you like me, huh?"
146563,L113631,u4281,m285,TOM,We can go together.
146564,L113630,u4278,m285,JANE,"Oh, good."
146565,L113629,u4281,m285,TOM,Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
146566,L113628,u4278,m285,JANE,Uh-huh.
146567,L113627,u4281,m285,TOM,No.  Were you going to you?
146568,L113626,u4278,m285,JANE,"Why, you need me for the story?"
146569,L113625,u4281,m285,TOM,No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
146570,L113624,u4278,m285,JANE,Nooo.  Is it your story?
146571,L113623,u4281,m285,TOM,What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
146572,L113622,u4278,m285,JANE,"Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh."
146573,L113621,u4281,m285,TOM,It's not important.
146574,L113620,u4278,m285,JANE,"I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me."
146575,L113619,u4281,m285,TOM,Yes.
146576,L113618,u4278,m285,JANE,"Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?"
146577,L113617,u4281,m285,TOM,I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
146578,L113611,u4278,m285,JANE,"Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage."
146579,L113610,u4281,m285,TOM,"If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?"
146580,L113609,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, what is it?"
146581,L113608,u4281,m285,TOM,I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
146582,L113607,u4278,m285,JANE,What?
146583,L113606,u4281,m285,TOM,"Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something."
146584,L113605,u4278,m285,JANE,Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
146585,L113604,u4281,m285,TOM,I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
146586,L113603,u4281,m285,TOM,Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
146587,L113602,u4278,m285,JANE,"Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?"
146588,L113601,u4281,m285,TOM,Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
146589,L113558,u4278,m285,JANE,I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
146590,L113557,u4281,m285,TOM,Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
146591,L113556,u4278,m285,JANE,It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
146592,L113555,u4278,m285,JANE,I'll be the judge of that.
146593,L113554,u4281,m285,TOM,I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
146594,L113553,u4278,m285,JANE,"Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy."
146595,L113527,u4278,m285,JANE,"Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude."
146596,L113526,u4281,m285,TOM,"Jennifer, you want to have another drink?"
146597,L113525,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, I'll go in and have a bite."
146598,L113524,u4281,m285,TOM,There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
146599,L113523,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on."
146600,L113522,u4281,m285,TOM,I didn't think you'd make it.
146601,L113502,u4278,m285,JANE,Okay.
146602,L113501,u4281,m285,TOM,I'll wait for you till seven.
146603,L113500,u4278,m285,JANE,Yeah?
146604,L113499,u4281,m285,TOM,Jane?
146605,L113495,u4278,m285,JANE,I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
146606,L113494,u4281,m285,TOM,"You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'"
146607,L113493,u4281,m285,TOM,"Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex."
146608,L113492,u4278,m285,JANE,Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
146609,L113491,u4281,m285,TOM,You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
146610,L113454,u4281,m285,TOM,George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
146611,L113453,u4278,m285,JANE,We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
146612,L113415,u4281,m285,TOM,Excited.
146613,L113414,u4278,m285,JANE,Nervous?
146614,L113379,u4278,m285,JANE,Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
146615,L113378,u4281,m285,TOM,You okay?
146616,L113377,u4281,m285,TOM,You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
146617,L113376,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you."
146618,L113375,u4281,m285,TOM,At work there's always this sort of film over you.
146619,L113374,u4278,m285,JANE,What do you mean clean?
146620,L113373,u4281,m285,TOM,It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
146621,L113333,u4281,m285,TOM,"Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you."
146622,L113332,u4278,m285,JANE,Billion.
146623,L113331,u4281,m285,TOM,"The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already."
146624,L113330,u4278,m285,JANE,Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
146625,L113329,u4281,m285,TOM,I've got another story.
146626,L113301,u4281,m285,TOM,"Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously."
146627,L113300,u4278,m285,JANE,Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
146628,L113297,u4278,m285,JANE,Yes.
146629,L113296,u4281,m285,TOM,So he was indicted?
146630,L113222,u4281,m285,TOM,Okay.
146631,L113221,u4278,m285,JANE,I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
146632,L113220,u4281,m285,TOM,Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
146633,L113219,u4278,m285,JANE,How's it going?
146634,L113218,u4281,m285,TOM,Hi.
146635,L113183,u4281,m285,TOM,And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
146636,L113182,u4278,m285,JANE,"I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting."
146637,L113181,u4281,m285,TOM,You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --
146638,L113180,u4278,m285,JANE,'Really a lot appreciate it...'
146639,L113179,u4281,m285,TOM,I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
146640,L113178,u4278,m285,JANE,No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
146641,L113177,u4281,m285,TOM,I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
146642,L113176,u4278,m285,JANE,You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
146643,L113175,u4281,m285,TOM,I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
146644,L113115,u4278,m285,JANE,"We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh..."
146645,L113114,u4281,m285,TOM,They said it would be okay if...
146646,L113103,u4281,m285,TOM,Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.
146647,L113102,u4278,m285,JANE,Hey?
146648,L113101,u4281,m285,TOM,I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
146649,L113085,u4278,m285,JANE,"Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it."
146650,L113084,u4281,m285,TOM,"Whoa, this was a mistake."
146651,L113083,u4278,m285,JANE,"I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'"
146652,L113082,u4281,m285,TOM,Uh-huh.
146653,L113081,u4278,m285,JANE,It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
146654,L113079,u4278,m285,JANE,"So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write."
146655,L113078,u4281,m285,TOM,One year...almost one year.
146656,L113077,u4278,m285,JANE,"Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?"
146657,L113076,u4281,m285,TOM,But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
146658,L113075,u4281,m285,TOM,I don't write.
146659,L113074,u4278,m285,JANE,What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
146660,L113073,u4281,m285,TOM,I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
146661,L113072,u4278,m285,JANE,I trust you.
146662,L113071,u4281,m285,TOM,"Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink."
146663,L113069,u4278,m285,JANE,How are you at back rubs?
146664,L113068,u4281,m285,TOM,Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
146665,L113067,u4278,m285,JANE,So great -- right?
146666,L113066,u4278,m285,JANE,I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
146667,L113065,u4281,m285,TOM,"No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up."
146668,L113064,u4278,m285,JANE,Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
146669,L113063,u4281,m285,TOM,"Yes, sure."
146670,L113062,u4278,m285,JANE,Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
146671,L113061,u4281,m285,TOM,That actually goes on...
146672,L113060,u4278,m285,JANE,"Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as ""White House"" sources say..."
146673,L113056,u4278,m285,JANE,"Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay."
146674,L113055,u4281,m285,TOM,Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
146675,L113054,u4278,m285,JANE,If we could just eat first.
146676,L113052,u4281,m285,TOM,I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.
146677,L113051,u4278,m285,JANE,"I like ""godsend."""
146678,L113050,u4281,m285,TOM,"I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?"
146679,L113049,u4281,m285,TOM,I was a lot earlier.
146680,L113048,u4278,m285,JANE,Hi.  I was worried I was early.
146681,L113046,u4281,m285,TOM,"Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that."
146682,L113045,u4278,m285,JANE,Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
146683,L113044,u4281,m285,TOM,I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
146684,L113043,u4278,m285,JANE,Hi.
146685,L113529,u4278,m285,JANE,Right back to you.
146686,L113528,u4279,m285,JENNIFER,I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
146687,L113368,u4278,m285,JANE,I can't be.
146688,L113367,u4279,m285,JENNIFER,You're saying stay away from him.
146689,L113366,u4278,m285,JANE,God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
146690,L113365,u4279,m285,JENNIFER,"Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything."
146691,L113364,u4278,m285,JANE,Go ahead -- what?
146692,L113363,u4279,m285,JENNIFER,This is very awkward.
146693,L113541,u4281,m285,TOM,I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
146694,L113540,u4279,m285,JENNIFER,I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
146695,L113539,u4279,m285,JENNIFER,Through the closet.
146696,L113538,u4281,m285,TOM,Where's the bathroom?
146697,L113535,u4281,m285,TOM,It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
146698,L113534,u4279,m285,JENNIFER,"The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't..."
146699,L113314,u4279,m285,JENNIFER,I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
146700,L113313,u4281,m285,TOM,This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
146701,L113312,u4279,m285,JENNIFER,"Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?"
146702,L113311,u4281,m285,TOM,"Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat."
146703,L113310,u4279,m285,JENNIFER,How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
146704,L113309,u4281,m285,TOM,So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
146705,L114005,u4281,m285,TOM,"...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy."
146706,L114004,u4283,m285,YOUNG WOMAN,Uh-huh.
146707,L114003,u4281,m285,TOM,"I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um..."
146708,L114002,u4283,m285,YOUNG WOMAN,"The way you were looking at me, I just went."
146709,L114001,u4281,m285,TOM,Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
146710,L114000,u4283,m285,YOUNG WOMAN,"Yes, I'm sorry."
146711,L113999,u4281,m285,TOM,Are you okay?
146712,L113998,u4283,m285,YOUNG WOMAN,I'm sorry.
146713,L113997,u4281,m285,TOM,That's enough.  That's enough.
146714,L114657,u4284,m286,ALICE,I'll pose any way you want.
146715,L114656,u4295,m286,WALTER,Look -  This pose is all wrong!
146716,L114655,u4284,m286,ALICE,"Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime."
146717,L114654,u4295,m286,WALTER,Whaddya mean?
146718,L114653,u4284,m286,ALICE,It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
146719,L114651,u4284,m286,ALICE,Are you a virgin?
146720,L114650,u4295,m286,WALTER,What!
146721,L114649,u4284,m286,ALICE,Walter can I ask you something?
146722,L114648,u4295,m286,WALTER,You're breaking my concentration!
146723,L114647,u4284,m286,ALICE,A girl with a body like mine?
146724,L114646,u4284,m286,ALICE,"Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you..."
146725,L114645,u4295,m286,WALTER,Um...
146726,L114644,u4284,m286,ALICE,When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
146727,L114643,u4295,m286,WALTER,I already told you I'm not.
146728,L114642,u4284,m286,ALICE,Not even a little bit?
146729,L114641,u4295,m286,WALTER,N-no...
146730,L114640,u4284,m286,ALICE,"Are you nervous, Walter?"
146731,L114639,u4295,m286,WALTER,Oh it's enough...
146732,L114638,u4284,m286,ALICE,That doesn't look like very much clay.
146733,L114635,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you."
146734,L114634,u4284,m286,ALICE,I'm almost ready -
146735,L114631,u4295,m286,WALTER,Shh!
146736,L114630,u4284,m286,ALICE,It's kind of dark -
146737,L114627,u4295,m286,WALTER,Uh-huh.
146738,L114626,u4284,m286,ALICE,"What, right now?"
146739,L114625,u4295,m286,WALTER,Tonight.
146740,L114623,u4284,m286,ALICE,Yeah.
146741,L114622,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?"
146742,L114621,u4284,m286,ALICE,"Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?"
146743,L114620,u4295,m286,WALTER,I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
146744,L114619,u4284,m286,ALICE,"Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!"
146745,L114618,u4295,m286,WALTER,I didn't finish talking to you!
146746,L114617,u4284,m286,ALICE,"Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!"
146747,L114615,u4295,m286,WALTER,I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
146748,L114614,u4284,m286,ALICE,What are you doing here?
146749,L114612,u4295,m286,WALTER,I'm going home!
146750,L114611,u4284,m286,ALICE,If you were an artist you could have created something!
146751,L114608,u4284,m286,ALICE,Oh yeah?
146752,L114607,u4295,m286,WALTER,That's not true I am a sculptor!
146753,L114591,u4284,m286,ALICE,I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
146754,L114590,u4295,m286,WALTER,I just might.
146755,L114589,u4284,m286,ALICE,Would you like to do me?
146756,L114579,u4295,m286,WALTER,Not anymore!
146757,L114578,u4284,m286,ALICE,Don't you work here?
146758,L114288,u4285,m286,ART,Righto.
146759,L114287,u4290,m286,LOU,See you later -
146760,L114285,u4285,m286,ART,He made a cat.
146761,L114284,u4290,m286,LOU,What did he do?
146762,L114283,u4285,m286,ART,Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
146763,L114282,u4290,m286,LOU,What the hell's going on?
146764,L114123,u4285,m286,ART,You know it.  I'm out of here.
146765,L114122,u4290,m286,LOU,"Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol."
146766,L114121,u4285,m286,ART,"Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight."
146767,L114120,u4290,m286,LOU,Is the manager cooperating?
146768,L114119,u4285,m286,ART,"Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands."
146769,L114118,u4290,m286,LOU,Anything new?
146770,L114117,u4285,m286,ART,Alright we're clear.
146771,L114874,u4295,m286,WALTER,Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
146772,L114873,u4286,m286,CARLA,Walter...stay away from me!
146773,L114869,u4286,m286,CARLA,There's...a body inside that statue!
146774,L114868,u4295,m286,WALTER,What?
146775,L114867,u4286,m286,CARLA,Walter...there's...
146776,L114857,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?"
146777,L114856,u4286,m286,CARLA,Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
146778,L114855,u4295,m286,WALTER,Would you let me make...a statue of you?
146779,L114854,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Just about anything, Walter."
146780,L114853,u4295,m286,WALTER,"I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?"
146781,L114852,u4286,m286,CARLA,Forget it.
146782,L114851,u4295,m286,WALTER,I'm sorry about what I said before.
146783,L114837,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!"
146784,L114836,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?"
146785,L114835,u4286,m286,CARLA,Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
146786,L114834,u4295,m286,WALTER,Why not?!
146787,L114833,u4286,m286,CARLA,Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
146788,L114832,u4295,m286,WALTER,No! I want to talk about it now!
146789,L114831,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it."
146790,L114830,u4295,m286,WALTER,You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
146791,L114829,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Walter, I'm sorry..."
146792,L114828,u4295,m286,WALTER,But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
146793,L114822,u4295,m286,WALTER,Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
146794,L114821,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?"
146795,L114818,u4286,m286,CARLA,What are you trying to say?
146796,L114817,u4295,m286,WALTER,- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
146797,L114815,u4295,m286,WALTER,Carla -
146798,L114814,u4286,m286,CARLA,Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
146799,L114813,u4295,m286,WALTER,I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
146800,L114812,u4286,m286,CARLA,"I like you very much, Walter."
146801,L114811,u4295,m286,WALTER,That means you like me!
146802,L114810,u4286,m286,CARLA,Of course I do!
146803,L114809,u4295,m286,WALTER,You think I'm creative?
146804,L114808,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess."
146805,L114807,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?"
146806,L114806,u4286,m286,CARLA,Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
146807,L114805,u4295,m286,WALTER,Hm...
146808,L114804,u4286,m286,CARLA,Nice night out...
146809,L114799,u4295,m286,WALTER,Bye!
146810,L114798,u4286,m286,CARLA,Goodbye.
146811,L114795,u4295,m286,WALTER,I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
146812,L114794,u4286,m286,CARLA,Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
146813,L114793,u4295,m286,WALTER,Are you ready?
146814,L114792,u4286,m286,CARLA,Thank you.
146815,L114791,u4295,m286,WALTER,"I mean, you look so pretty."
146816,L114741,u4295,m286,WALTER,"I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues..."
146817,L114740,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter."
146818,L114739,u4295,m286,WALTER,I know what it is to be ignored.
146819,L114731,u4286,m286,CARLA,Every word...
146820,L114730,u4295,m286,WALTER,"It's true, isn't it?"
146821,L114729,u4295,m286,WALTER,All about me...
146822,L114728,u4286,m286,CARLA,Yes Walter.
146823,L114727,u4295,m286,WALTER,Did you hear what he said?
146824,L114706,u4295,m286,WALTER,Sorry...
146825,L114705,u4286,m286,CARLA,Walter!  Jeez!
146826,L114704,u4295,m286,WALTER,May I please have another little kiss?
146827,L114702,u4295,m286,WALTER,There there...
146828,L114701,u4286,m286,CARLA,Where where...
146829,L114700,u4295,m286,WALTER,Here here...
146830,L114699,u4286,m286,CARLA,"More champagne, your majesty?"
146831,L114695,u4286,m286,CARLA,Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
146832,L114694,u4295,m286,WALTER,You think she's better than Murdered Man?
146833,L114680,u4295,m286,WALTER,Better!
146834,L114679,u4286,m286,CARLA,Is it murdered man?
146835,L114678,u4295,m286,WALTER,Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
146836,L114677,u4286,m286,CARLA,Oh yeah?
146837,L114676,u4295,m286,WALTER,I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
146838,L114675,u4286,m286,CARLA,"What's up, Walter?"
146839,L114671,u4295,m286,WALTER,Oh...
146840,L114670,u4286,m286,CARLA,These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
146841,L114553,u4295,m286,WALTER,Carla...
146842,L114552,u4286,m286,CARLA,Hi Walter.
146843,L114538,u4286,m286,CARLA,Now you're a professional!
146844,L114537,u4295,m286,WALTER,Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
146845,L114507,u4295,m286,WALTER,It wasn't easy.
146846,L114506,u4286,m286,CARLA,"How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?"
146847,L114503,u4295,m286,WALTER,Me too.
146848,L114502,u4286,m286,CARLA,Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
146849,L114497,u4286,m286,CARLA,You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
146850,L114496,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before."
146851,L114495,u4286,m286,CARLA,Let's see it.
146852,L114494,u4295,m286,WALTER,It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
146853,L114493,u4286,m286,CARLA,Look at the size of it!
146854,L114464,u4295,m286,WALTER,Yeah it was all just an accident.
146855,L114463,u4286,m286,CARLA,"It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program."
146856,L114452,u4295,m286,WALTER,Murdered man.
146857,L114451,u4286,m286,CARLA,What's it called?
146858,L114450,u4295,m286,WALTER,It's a...full length life-size figure!
146859,L114449,u4286,m286,CARLA,Great!  What is it?
146860,L114248,u4286,m286,CARLA,Of course...it's wonderful.
146861,L114247,u4295,m286,WALTER,You really like it?
146862,L114224,u4295,m286,WALTER,Honest?
146863,L114223,u4286,m286,CARLA,"I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -"
146864,L114216,u4295,m286,WALTER,A thing I made.
146865,L114215,u4286,m286,CARLA,Don't worry about him...what have you got?
146866,L114691,u4291,m286,MAXWELL,I'm honored to know this man.
146867,L114690,u4286,m286,CARLA,Walter...I can't believe it.
146868,L114687,u4286,m286,CARLA,"When did you make this, Walter?"
146869,L114686,u4291,m286,MAXWELL,Put it in the middle of the room!
146870,L114665,u4291,m286,MAXWELL,Hm.
146871,L114664,u4286,m286,CARLA,Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
146872,L114663,u4291,m286,MAXWELL,What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
146873,L114662,u4286,m286,CARLA,It was.
146874,L114661,u4291,m286,MAXWELL,I hope this was made with egg whites!
146875,L114660,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Here you go, enjoy."
146876,L114131,u4291,m286,MAXWELL,Is it?  I've forgotten.
146877,L114130,u4286,m286,CARLA,That's word for word.
146878,L114598,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Well, it all depends, Leonard..."
146879,L114597,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Would you pose for me for free?
146880,L114533,u4288,m286,LEONARD,You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
146881,L114532,u4286,m286,CARLA,Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
146882,L114531,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract..."
146883,L114528,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
146884,L114527,u4286,m286,CARLA,"That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event."
146885,L114526,u4288,m286,LEONARD,It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
146886,L114522,u4286,m286,CARLA,You're right.  We should build a collection first.
146887,L114521,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong."
146888,L114520,u4286,m286,CARLA,"What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?"
146889,L114519,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Why don't you cover it up, Walter!"
146890,L114518,u4286,m286,CARLA,Why not?
146891,L114517,u4288,m286,LEONARD,No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
146892,L114515,u4288,m286,LEONARD,I admit it.
146893,L114514,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Well then admit it, it's a work of genius."
146894,L114512,u4286,m286,CARLA,Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
146895,L114511,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Don't ask.
146896,L114510,u4286,m286,CARLA,"I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?"
146897,L114509,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Nothing...nothing at all.
146898,L114508,u4286,m286,CARLA,What's the matter with you?
146899,L114491,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?"
146900,L114490,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better."
146901,L114466,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
146902,L114465,u4286,m286,CARLA,Are you alright?
146903,L114454,u4286,m286,CARLA,"When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess."
146904,L114453,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Murdered...man?...
146905,L114446,u4288,m286,LEONARD,I'm totally serious!
146906,L114445,u4286,m286,CARLA,Are you trying to be funny?
146907,L114437,u4286,m286,CARLA,"Leonard, what are you doing?"
146908,L114436,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with."
146909,L114243,u4288,m286,LEONARD,I wouldn't give up your day job.
146910,L114242,u4286,m286,CARLA,Maybe so...
146911,L114211,u4288,m286,LEONARD,What are you doing here so early?
146912,L114210,u4286,m286,CARLA,Hi Walter...
146913,L114209,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice..."
146914,L114208,u4286,m286,CARLA,I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
146915,L114113,u4286,m286,CARLA,Do you have to be so cold to him?
146916,L114112,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much..."
146917,L114864,u4289,m286,LINK,"Yeah, right outside the door!"
146918,L114863,u4287,m286,CUFF,"That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!"
146919,L114803,u4287,m286,CUFF,Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.
146920,L114802,u4289,m286,LINK,"No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E."
146921,L114801,u4287,m286,CUFF,"Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?"
146922,L114722,u4287,m286,CUFF,No man I'm on my own plane.
146923,L114721,u4289,m286,LINK,Didn't you hear him?
146924,L114720,u4287,m286,CUFF,What did he say?
146925,L114685,u4287,m286,CUFF,"Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?"
146926,L114684,u4289,m286,LINK,Man this is heavy!
146927,L114600,u4289,m286,LINK,Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
146928,L114599,u4287,m286,CUFF,"Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes..."
146929,L114561,u4287,m286,CUFF,Let's check out the scene.
146930,L114560,u4289,m286,LINK,Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
146931,L114559,u4287,m286,CUFF,Man look at that get up !
146932,L114550,u4289,m286,LINK,Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
146933,L114549,u4287,m286,CUFF,There's that weird dude again.
146934,L114458,u4287,m286,CUFF,I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
146935,L114457,u4289,m286,LINK,Now what kind of statue was that?
146936,L114456,u4287,m286,CUFF,I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
146937,L114455,u4289,m286,LINK,"Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series..."
146938,L114424,u4287,m286,CUFF,"I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!"
146939,L114423,u4289,m286,LINK,I wonder what his deal is.
146940,L114421,u4289,m286,LINK,"I know, man."
146941,L114420,u4287,m286,CUFF,"I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?"
146942,L114419,u4289,m286,LINK,"I know, man."
146943,L114418,u4287,m286,CUFF,"But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!"
146944,L114417,u4289,m286,LINK,"I know, man."
146945,L114416,u4287,m286,CUFF,"I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create."
146946,L114415,u4289,m286,LINK,I know.
146947,L114414,u4287,m286,CUFF,"Look at that, man.  Big deal."
146948,L114277,u4287,m286,CUFF,"Not only that, he copied us!"
146949,L114276,u4289,m286,LINK,"Yeah, can you say plagiarism?"
146950,L114146,u4289,m286,LINK,I do the research.
146951,L114145,u4287,m286,CUFF,It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
146952,L114778,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them..."
146953,L114777,u4295,m286,WALTER,Yeah?
146954,L114776,u4288,m286,LEONARD,When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
146955,L114774,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Never mind...
146956,L114773,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Well, w-what did you do?"
146957,L114772,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!"
146958,L114771,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!"
146959,L114770,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
146960,L114769,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Put it down, Walter."
146961,L114768,u4295,m286,WALTER,Whatsamatter Leonard?
146962,L114767,u4288,m286,LEONARD,You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
146963,L114766,u4295,m286,WALTER,Whatsamatter Leonard?
146964,L114765,u4295,m286,WALTER,Just wait till you see this!
146965,L114764,u4288,m286,LEONARD,What do you have in the box?
146966,L114763,u4288,m286,LEONARD,It was.
146967,L114762,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?"
146968,L114736,u4295,m286,WALTER,Yeah and what would I say?
146969,L114735,u4288,m286,LEONARD,You might talk too much.
146970,L114734,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Yeah, why?"
146971,L114733,u4288,m286,LEONARD,You better hold off on the bubbly.
146972,L114530,u4288,m286,LEONARD,These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
146973,L114529,u4295,m286,WALTER,A show..how soon can we go?
146974,L114525,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years..."
146975,L114524,u4295,m286,WALTER,A show?!  Like this Sunday?
146976,L114499,u4295,m286,WALTER,You want me to open a window or something?
146977,L114498,u4288,m286,LEONARD,It's hot in here...
146978,L114462,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way."
146979,L114461,u4288,m286,LEONARD,You didn't mean to what?
146980,L114460,u4295,m286,WALTER,"I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to."
146981,L114459,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Well...why murdered man?
146982,L114448,u4295,m286,WALTER,I-I already got a new one!
146983,L114447,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?"
146984,L114442,u4295,m286,WALTER,"What, Mr. De Santis?"
146985,L114441,u4288,m286,LEONARD,You know what that proves?
146986,L114439,u4288,m286,LEONARD,What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
146987,L114438,u4295,m286,WALTER,Hiya Carla.
146988,L114434,u4295,m286,WALTER,They are?
146989,L114433,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now..."
146990,L114432,u4295,m286,WALTER,I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
146991,L114431,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Have a seat -
146992,L114430,u4295,m286,WALTER,H-have a seat?
146993,L114301,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Good night Walter.
146994,L114300,u4295,m286,WALTER,OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
146995,L114299,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Go home.
146996,L114298,u4295,m286,WALTER,A parakeet?
146997,L114297,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something."
146998,L114296,u4295,m286,WALTER,I don't have another cat!
146999,L114295,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat."
147000,L114294,u4295,m286,WALTER,Well...
147001,L114293,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything."
147002,L114292,u4295,m286,WALTER,Well I don't know -
147003,L114291,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired."
147004,L114290,u4295,m286,WALTER,Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
147005,L114259,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Enough already about it - get to work!
147006,L114258,u4295,m286,WALTER,People seem to like my cat.
147007,L114246,u4295,m286,WALTER,Sure!
147008,L114245,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning."
147009,L114244,u4295,m286,WALTER,All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
147010,L114241,u4295,m286,WALTER,Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
147011,L114240,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?"
147012,L114239,u4288,m286,LEONARD,"Got carried away, huh?"
147013,L114238,u4295,m286,WALTER,I didn't mean to.
147014,L114237,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Well...why did you put a knife in it?
147015,L114231,u4288,m286,LEONARD,You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
147016,L114230,u4295,m286,WALTER,"You want to buy it, put it in the club?"
147017,L114229,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Well it sure looks dead enough.
147018,L114228,u4295,m286,WALTER,Yeah.
147019,L114227,u4288,m286,LEONARD,Dead Cat?
147020,L114226,u4295,m286,WALTER,Dead Cat!
147021,L114222,u4295,m286,WALTER,"I said I did, didn't I!"
147022,L114221,u4288,m286,LEONARD,You...made that?
147023,L114220,u4295,m286,WALTER,I didn't buy it I made it.

147098,L114847,u4291,m286,MAXWELL,Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
147099,L114787,u4291,m286,MAXWELL,It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
147100,L114786,u4295,m286,WALTER,Why not?
147101,L114785,u4291,m286,MAXWELL,"I won't say good luck, Walter."

147121,L114137,u4291,m286,MAXWELL,"I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!"
147122,L114136,u4295,m286,WALTER,I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
147123,L114129,u4295,m286,WALTER,"""Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"""

147127,L114325,u4292,m286,MAYOLIA,Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
147128,L114324,u4295,m286,WALTER,Gee.  Thanks.
147129,L114323,u4292,m286,MAYOLIA,I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...

147131,L114320,u4295,m286,WALTER,You don't have to do anything!
147132,L114319,u4292,m286,MAYOLIA,"I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!"
147133,L114318,u4295,m286,WALTER,I don't think so Mayolia.
147134,L114316,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady."
147135,L114315,u4292,m286,MAYOLIA,"Well, I'll go home with you."
147136,L114314,u4295,m286,WALTER,I can't.  I gotta go home.
147137,L114313,u4292,m286,MAYOLIA,Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.

147139,L114311,u4292,m286,MAYOLIA,A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
147140,L114310,u4295,m286,WALTER,T-turned on?
147141,L114309,u4292,m286,MAYOLIA,It's like...you've turned on.
147142,L114307,u4295,m286,WALTER,Really?
147143,L114306,u4292,m286,MAYOLIA,With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
147144,L114305,u4295,m286,WALTER,With Dead Cat?
147145,L114304,u4292,m286,MAYOLIA,"Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight."
147146,L114303,u4295,m286,WALTER,Hello Mayolia.
147147,L114281,u4292,m286,MAYOLIA,"Your work, the layers of irony."

147151,L114402,u4295,m286,WALTER,I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
147152,L114401,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,Well why don't you clean up this dump!
147153,L114400,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!"
147154,L114396,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!"
147155,L114395,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
147156,L114393,u4295,m286,WALTER,Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
147157,L114392,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
147158,L114391,u4295,m286,WALTER,"I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that."
147159,L114390,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
147160,L114389,u4295,m286,WALTER,I was just straightening up the place.
147161,L114388,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
147162,L114387,u4295,m286,WALTER,Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
147163,L114386,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,What's all the noise in here!
147164,L114186,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Good night, Mrs. Swicker -"
147165,L114185,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,Good night Walter...
147166,L114184,u4295,m286,WALTER,OK Mrs. Swicker.
147167,L114183,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,If you see him.
147168,L114182,u4295,m286,WALTER,T-tell him that?
147169,L114181,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,"What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -"
147170,L114180,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Uh, no, I didn't see him at all."
147171,L114178,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do..."
147172,L114177,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,"If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute."
147173,L114176,u4295,m286,WALTER,"I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker."
147174,L114175,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
147175,L114174,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Oh, OK."
147176,L114173,u4293,m286,MRS. SWICKER,Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
147177,L114172,u4295,m286,WALTER,"Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker."
147178,L115486,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,"No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades."
147179,L115485,u4296,m287,AMILYN,"I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them."
147180,L115484,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
147181,L115483,u4296,m287,AMILYN,I look horrible.
147182,L115482,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,Cheer up.  You may still.
147183,L115481,u4296,m287,AMILYN,I had him in my grasp.
147184,L115480,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
147185,L115479,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,Shut up!  You let him have it!
147186,L115478,u4296,m287,AMILYN,My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
147187,L115477,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,What's wrong with you!?!
147188,L115279,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,"Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless."
147189,L115278,u4296,m287,AMILYN,I don't think this is gold.
147190,L115442,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,Yes!
147191,L115441,u4297,m287,ANDY,Let's move out!

147196,L115430,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
147197,L115429,u4297,m287,ANDY,... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
147198,L115064,u4297,m287,ANDY,"Litter, yeah!"
147199,L115063,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Well, um... litter?"
147200,L115059,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'"
147201,L115058,u4297,m287,ANDY,I like it.  Can I be your friend?
147202,L115762,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons."
147203,L115761,u4297,m287,ANDY,"Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?"
147204,L115698,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
147205,L115697,u4297,m287,ANDY,Buffy!  Looking tasty.
147206,L115436,u4297,m287,ANDY,Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
147207,L115435,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Don't grab me, okay?"
147208,L115080,u4300,m287,BUFFY,He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
147209,L115079,u4297,m287,ANDY,Man has a complex.
147210,L114990,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Andy!
147211,L114989,u4297,m287,ANDY,"Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?"
147212,L114988,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Nice game.
147213,L115377,u4312,m287,PIKE,I mean it.
147214,L115376,u4298,m287,BENNY,I'm hungry.
147215,L115375,u4312,m287,PIKE,Get away from here.
147216,L115374,u4298,m287,BENNY,"Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!"
147217,L115373,u4298,m287,BENNY,The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
147218,L115372,u4312,m287,PIKE,"No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something."
147219,L115371,u4298,m287,BENNY,I... feel.... pretty.
147220,L115370,u4312,m287,PIKE,"You look like shit, Benny."
147221,L115369,u4298,m287,BENNY,I'm fine.
147222,L115368,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?"
147223,L115367,u4298,m287,BENNY,"Invite me in, Pike."
147224,L115366,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --"
147225,L115365,u4298,m287,BENNY,Let me in.
147226,L115364,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!"
147227,L115164,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans."
147228,L115163,u4298,m287,BENNY,Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
147229,L115162,u4312,m287,PIKE,You think?  Split?
147230,L115161,u4298,m287,BENNY,"When you get your car together, man, let's bail."
147231,L115140,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me."
147232,L115139,u4298,m287,BENNY,"I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you."
147233,L115138,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?"
147234,L115137,u4298,m287,BENNY,"Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God."
147235,L115136,u4312,m287,PIKE,Would you sleep with them?
147236,L115135,u4298,m287,BENNY,"They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them."
147237,L115134,u4312,m287,PIKE,You didn't like them.
147238,L115133,u4298,m287,BENNY,Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
147239,L115132,u4312,m287,PIKE,Bummer metaphor.
147240,L115131,u4298,m287,BENNY,Hey!  She wasted my dog!
147241,L115125,u4312,m287,PIKE,We hate you guys!
147242,L115124,u4298,m287,BENNY,You're the guys from the movie!
147243,L115118,u4312,m287,PIKE,Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
147244,L115117,u4298,m287,BENNY,Figures.
147245,L115108,u4298,m287,BENNY,Amazing!
147246,L115107,u4312,m287,PIKE,It's coffee.
147247,L115106,u4312,m287,PIKE,"We're looking at a dog, possible coffee..."
147248,L115105,u4298,m287,BENNY,"That's it, man.  That's the whole story."
147249,L115104,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Come on, come on, fork up the scub."
147250,L114974,u4298,m287,BENNY,"Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens."
147251,L114973,u4312,m287,PIKE,"No, we didn't."
147252,L114968,u4312,m287,PIKE,Wrong answer!  No prize.
147253,L114967,u4298,m287,BENNY,Suck!
147254,L114966,u4312,m287,PIKE,Booo!
147255,L115596,u4299,m287,BIKER,Down there.
147256,L115595,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Which way did she go?
147257,L115594,u4299,m287,BIKER,"My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me."
147258,L115593,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Wheels?
147259,L115592,u4299,m287,BIKER,"Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels."
147260,L115591,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Yes.
147261,L115590,u4299,m287,BIKER,"You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?"
147262,L115589,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Did you see a girl come by here?
147263,L115641,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
147264,L115640,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,He doesn't look fifty.
147265,L115625,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Hi, guys."
147266,L115624,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,"Hi, Buffy."
147267,L115428,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,Eeyuu.
147268,L115427,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Dying.
147269,L115174,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Don't tread on the earth?
147270,L115173,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,"Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth."
147271,L115042,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it."
147272,L115041,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
147273,L114977,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Probably.  What movie is this?
147274,L114976,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,"Oh, my God.  Is that true?"
147275,L114959,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
147276,L114958,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Yeah, I guess."
147277,L114957,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
147278,L114950,u4300,m287,BUFFY,What's playing there?
147279,L114949,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,Excellent.
147280,L115668,u4301,m287,BUFFY'S MOM,Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
147281,L115667,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby."
147282,L115666,u4301,m287,BUFFY'S MOM,What's Bobby gonna say?
147283,L115665,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Maybe.
147284,L115664,u4301,m287,BUFFY'S MOM,Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
147285,L115663,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Yeah?
147286,L115662,u4301,m287,BUFFY'S MOM,"Buffy, honey?"
147287,L115254,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Uum... around ten?
147288,L115253,u4301,m287,BUFFY'S MOM,Do you know what time it is?
147289,L115722,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,I'm out of here.  Jenny.
147290,L115721,u4300,m287,BUFFY,You left me a message?
147291,L115720,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,You weren't home.  Like always.
147292,L115719,u4300,m287,BUFFY,You broke up with my machine?
147293,L115718,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,Didn't you get my message?
147294,L115717,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"No, you didn't.  When?"
147295,L115716,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this."
147296,L115715,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I don't understand.
147297,L115714,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,I'm here with Jenny.
147298,L115713,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I thought we were meeting here.
147299,L115712,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Buffy, what are you doing here?"
147300,L115537,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
147301,L115536,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?"
147302,L115439,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,So I noticed.
147303,L115438,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I can take care of myself, Jeffrey."
147304,L115262,u4300,m287,BUFFY,'Bye.
147305,L115261,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
147306,L115260,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
147307,L115259,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
147308,L115258,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I do?  I guess I do.
147309,L115257,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat."
147310,L115184,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Jealous?
147311,L115183,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
147312,L115045,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Hi.
147313,L115044,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,Hey there.
147314,L115035,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Nothing.  It was just a dream.
147315,L115034,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Come on, what was it?"
147316,L115033,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Nothing.
147317,L115032,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,What'd you dream about?
147318,L115031,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,You were having a nightmare.
147319,L115030,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow."
147320,L115025,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Mmmnkay.
147321,L115024,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
147322,L115023,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
147323,L115022,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"It's the news, Buffy."
147324,L115021,u4300,m287,BUFFY,What show is this?
147325,L115020,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable..."
147326,L115019,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Something like that.
147327,L115018,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh."
147328,L115017,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
147329,L115007,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine."
147330,L115006,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,You okay?
147331,L115825,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I am so sure.
147332,L115824,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,I am a God!  A God!
147333,L115813,u4300,m287,BUFFY,No...
147334,L115812,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
147335,L115811,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I think you've forgotten something.
147336,L115810,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,You're even weaker than the others.
147337,L115808,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,What?
147338,L115807,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
147339,L115806,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,"Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors."
147340,L115840,u4312,m287,PIKE,"You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait."
147341,L115839,u4300,m287,BUFFY,We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
147342,L115838,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean."
147343,L115837,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
147344,L115836,u4312,m287,PIKE,"I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later."
147345,L115820,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Get away from me!
147346,L115819,u4312,m287,PIKE,Are you okay?
147347,L115764,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone."
147348,L115763,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Good thing one of us was prepared.
147349,L115760,u4312,m287,PIKE,You say that like it's a bad thing.
147350,L115759,u4300,m287,BUFFY,You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
147351,L115758,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart."
147352,L115757,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I'm going out the front.
147353,L115729,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
147354,L115728,u4312,m287,PIKE,Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
147355,L115727,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time."
147356,L115726,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I'm glad you came.
147357,L115725,u4312,m287,PIKE,That's me.
147358,L115724,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Pretty shallow of you.
147359,L115723,u4312,m287,PIKE,I crashed your party.
147360,L115692,u4312,m287,PIKE,Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
147361,L115691,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Leave me alone.
147362,L115690,u4312,m287,PIKE,I should have known.
147363,L115689,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
147364,L115688,u4312,m287,PIKE,"But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy."
147365,L115687,u4300,m287,BUFFY,He did what he was supposed to.
147366,L115686,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry..."
147367,L115685,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore."
147368,L115684,u4312,m287,PIKE,You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
147369,L115683,u4300,m287,BUFFY,It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
147370,L115682,u4312,m287,PIKE,I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
147371,L115681,u4300,m287,BUFFY,In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
147372,L115680,u4312,m287,PIKE,What for?
147373,L115679,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I'm going to the dance.
147374,L115678,u4312,m287,PIKE,Second word... sound like 'dance'.
147375,L115677,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I'm going to the senior dance.
147376,L115676,u4312,m287,PIKE,Come again?
147377,L115675,u4300,m287,BUFFY,For the dance.
147378,L115674,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Dress, huh?  What for?"
147379,L115673,u4300,m287,BUFFY,A dress.
147380,L115672,u4312,m287,PIKE,Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
147381,L115671,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
147382,L115670,u4312,m287,PIKE,I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
147383,L115604,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Merrick...
147384,L115603,u4312,m287,PIKE,Who?
147385,L115602,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him."
147386,L115601,u4312,m287,PIKE,Buffy?  What's wrong?
147387,L115588,u4312,m287,PIKE,I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
147388,L115587,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Pike, I don't think you're up to this."
147389,L115585,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Besides, Oxnard sucks."
147390,L115584,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Thanks.
147391,L115583,u4312,m287,PIKE,"I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from."
147392,L115582,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Why'd you come back?
147393,L115581,u4312,m287,PIKE,I know.
147394,L115580,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I didn't expect to see you.
147395,L115521,u4312,m287,PIKE,"You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost."
147396,L115520,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Yeah?
147397,L115519,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Hey, Buffy..."
147398,L115518,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Mmkay.
147399,L115517,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great."
147400,L115516,u4300,m287,BUFFY,You sure?
147401,L115515,u4312,m287,PIKE,I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
147402,L115514,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
147403,L115513,u4312,m287,PIKE,"No, you're not."
147404,L115512,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling."
147405,L115511,u4312,m287,PIKE,"I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead."
147406,L115510,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this."
147407,L115509,u4312,m287,PIKE,I'll back that up.
147408,L115508,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Things are kind of confusing.
147409,L115505,u4300,m287,BUFFY,It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
147410,L115504,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?"
147411,L115503,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard."
147412,L115502,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Where are you gonna go?
147413,L115501,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone."
147414,L115500,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Well, stay here tonight."
147415,L115499,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene."
147416,L115498,u4300,m287,BUFFY,You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
147417,L115497,u4312,m287,PIKE,God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
147418,L115496,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Yeah.
147419,L115495,u4312,m287,PIKE,"They were vampires, weren't they?"
147420,L115494,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Not exactly.
147421,L115493,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?"
147422,L115492,u4312,m287,PIKE,Water.  Okay.
147423,L115491,u4300,m287,BUFFY,You want some water or something?
147424,L115490,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though."
147425,L115489,u4300,m287,BUFFY,How are you doing?
147426,L115473,u4312,m287,PIKE,It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
147427,L115472,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Is that your car?
147428,L115471,u4312,m287,PIKE,Hi there.
147429,L115470,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Hi.
147430,L115116,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Buffy.
147431,L115115,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?"
147432,L115112,u4300,m287,BUFFY,You guys are thrashed.
147433,L115111,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?"
147434,L114965,u4300,m287,BUFFY,It could happen.
147435,L114964,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Will you guys shut up, please?"
147436,L115093,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Like my homework.
147437,L115092,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,Like what?
147438,L115091,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework."
147439,L115090,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,"I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting."
147440,L115089,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Bogutude.  Blow it off.
147441,L115088,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
147442,L115070,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,"Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?"
147443,L115069,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Bugs.
147444,L115057,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend."
147445,L115056,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,It is a pretty crucial subject.
147446,L115053,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
147447,L115052,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"It has to be, like a socially conscious theme."
147448,L115707,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,I know.  I like your little outfit.
147449,L115706,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"You look way pretty, Kim."
147450,L115705,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Yeah, whoops I came."
147451,L115704,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
147452,L115657,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Get out of my facial.
147453,L115656,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
147454,L115647,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day."
147455,L115646,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
147456,L115645,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Excuse me for having something important to do.
147457,L115630,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Oh my God you're having an affair.
147458,L115629,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --"
147459,L115628,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird."
147460,L115627,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I forgot.
147461,L115626,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,You were supposed to be here at three.
147462,L115147,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Get a boob job.
147463,L115146,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National."
147464,L115145,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
147465,L115095,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Kimberly, it's the senior dance."
147466,L115094,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
147467,L115085,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Cafe Blase.
147468,L115084,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Where?
147469,L115083,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Let's meet tonight, okay?"
147470,L114961,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"'Just remember you're in training, son'"
147471,L114960,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,What did Jeffrey's dad say?
147472,L114952,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Nice ensemble!
147473,L114951,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
147474,L114948,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
147475,L114947,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?"
147476,L114944,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
147477,L114943,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Beverly Center.
147478,L114938,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Well, where?"
147479,L114937,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Why don't we see a movie?
147480,L114936,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,What are we doing?
147481,L114934,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Please.  It's so '91.
147482,L114933,u4300,m287,BUFFY,) What do you think?
147483,L114932,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored."
147484,L115570,u4300,m287,BUFFY,He knows who I am!
147485,L115569,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Wait!
147486,L115535,u4300,m287,BUFFY,And where are they now?
147487,L115534,u4310,m287,MERRICK,None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
147488,L115533,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning."
147489,L115532,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Football is my life.
147490,L115531,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan."
147491,L115530,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready."
147492,L115529,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
147493,L115528,u4310,m287,MERRICK,All right.
147494,L115527,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left."
147495,L115526,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
147496,L115525,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
147497,L115524,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Another distraction.  It's not right.
147498,L115523,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk."
147499,L115522,u4310,m287,MERRICK,There isn't time.
147500,L115475,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
147501,L115474,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Interesting.
147502,L115451,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
147503,L115450,u4310,m287,MERRICK,I want to die.
147504,L115449,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me."
147505,L115448,u4310,m287,MERRICK,My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
147506,L115447,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena."
147507,L115446,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?"
147508,L115445,u4300,m287,BUFFY,We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
147509,L115444,u4310,m287,MERRICK,I can't work this.
147510,L115443,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?"
147511,L115423,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time."
147512,L115422,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Vampires of the world, beware."
147513,L115421,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one."
147514,L115420,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"As for example, what?"
147515,L115419,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have."
147516,L115418,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"And it makes it worse when I die, right?"
147517,L115417,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it..."
147518,L115416,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I'm curious, is all."
147519,L115415,u4310,m287,MERRICK,It isn't important.
147520,L115414,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I wish you would.
147521,L115413,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this."
147522,L115412,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Watchers?
147523,L115411,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers."
147524,L115410,u4300,m287,BUFFY,How can you keep doing this?
147525,L115409,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Not if you're careful.
147526,L115408,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?"
147527,L115407,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Five.
147528,L115406,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Five?
147529,L115405,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?"
147530,L115404,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I...
147531,L115403,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?"
147532,L115402,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Oh, fuck you!"
147533,L115401,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'"
147534,L115400,u4300,m287,BUFFY,And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
147535,L115399,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Buffy...
147536,L115398,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?"
147537,L115397,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Don't start with me again.
147538,L115396,u4300,m287,BUFFY,A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
147539,L115395,u4310,m287,MERRICK,A what?
147540,L115394,u4300,m287,BUFFY,You are such a wet.
147541,L115393,u4310,m287,MERRICK,You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
147542,L115392,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me."
147543,L115391,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them."
147544,L115390,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject."
147545,L115389,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps."
147546,L115388,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
147547,L115387,u4310,m287,MERRICK,And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
147548,L115386,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Fine.
147549,L115385,u4310,m287,MERRICK,He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
147550,L115358,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Try to pay attention.
147551,L115357,u4300,m287,BUFFY,What!?!
147552,L115347,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Oh.
147553,L115346,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Same one.
147554,L115345,u4300,m287,BUFFY,They were vampires?
147555,L115344,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?"
147556,L115343,u4300,m287,BUFFY,My nails.
147557,L115342,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
147558,L115341,u4300,m287,BUFFY,If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
147559,L115340,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?"
147560,L115339,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?"
147561,L115338,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying."
147562,L115337,u4300,m287,BUFFY,What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
147563,L115336,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Your turn.
147564,L115335,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par."
147565,L115334,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
147566,L115333,u4300,m287,BUFFY,No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
147567,L115332,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?"
147568,L115331,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Put your head back.
147569,L115330,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process."
147570,L115329,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Oh.  Sorry.
147571,L115328,u4310,m287,MERRICK,I don't think you understand the full implications of --
147572,L115327,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?"
147573,L115326,u4310,m287,MERRICK,It was necessary.
147574,L115325,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!"
147575,L115324,u4310,m287,MERRICK,And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
147576,L115323,u4300,m287,BUFFY,But you threw a knife at my head!
147577,L115322,u4310,m287,MERRICK,I had to test you.
147578,L115321,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!"
147579,L115319,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Oh.  Good.
147580,L115318,u4300,m287,BUFFY,No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
147581,L115317,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
147582,L115316,u4300,m287,BUFFY,No -- you don't have to --
147583,L115315,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Who we gonna beat?
147584,L115314,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Who we gonna beat?
147585,L115313,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Okay.
147586,L115312,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer."
147587,L115311,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Here?
147588,L115310,u4310,m287,MERRICK,All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
147589,L115309,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Sporting events, yeah."
147590,L115308,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?"
147591,L115307,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
147592,L115306,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"But you enjoyed it, yes?"
147593,L115305,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look."
147594,L115304,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?"
147595,L115303,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Uh... gym.
147596,L115302,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?"
147597,L115301,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Not a pressing issue.
147598,L115300,u4310,m287,MERRICK,We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
147599,L115299,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?"
147600,L115298,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them."
147601,L115297,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?"
147602,L115296,u4310,m287,MERRICK,We'll cover it later.
147603,L115295,u4300,m287,BUFFY,What?
147604,L115294,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention."
147605,L115293,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Oh, him."
147606,L115292,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos."
147607,L115291,u4300,m287,BUFFY,A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
147608,L115290,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
147609,L115289,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Why do you keep saying that?
147610,L115288,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time."
147611,L115287,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"What, um...  What do we do?"
147612,L115286,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Our purposes.
147613,L115285,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes."
147614,L115252,u4310,m287,MERRICK,It's true.
147615,L115251,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?"
147616,L115249,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Skip it.
147617,L115248,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I have cheerleading squad.
147618,L115247,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Meet me at this address after school.
147619,L115246,u4300,m287,BUFFY,All right.
147620,L115245,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
147621,L115244,u4300,m287,BUFFY,She --
147622,L115243,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Where's the other one?
147623,L115240,u4310,m287,MERRICK,We wait for Robert to wake up.
147624,L115239,u4300,m287,BUFFY,All right.  What do we do now?
147625,L115238,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
147626,L115237,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Wait a minute.
147627,L115235,u4310,m287,MERRICK,This is it.
147628,L115234,u4300,m287,BUFFY,None of your business.  God.
147629,L115233,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Cramps?
147630,L115232,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Ow.
147631,L115231,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida."
147632,L115230,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
147633,L115229,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
147634,L115228,u4310,m287,MERRICK,I have to show you.
147635,L115227,u4300,m287,BUFFY,How do you know all this?
147636,L115226,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Lothos.
147637,L115225,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me."
147638,L115224,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something."
147639,L115223,u4310,m287,MERRICK,China.
147640,L115222,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute..."
147641,L115221,u4310,m287,MERRICK,In Virginia.
147642,L115220,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I was a slave.
147643,L115219,u4310,m287,MERRICK,In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
147644,L115218,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Everybody does.
147645,L115217,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
147646,L115216,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Just stay away from me, okay?"
147647,L115212,u4310,m287,MERRICK,I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
147648,L115211,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
147649,L115210,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Yes.
147650,L115209,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires."
147651,L115208,u4310,m287,MERRICK,To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
147652,L115207,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Time to do what?
147653,L115206,u4310,m287,MERRICK,You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
147654,L115205,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?"
147655,L115204,u4310,m287,MERRICK,You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
147656,L115203,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy."
147657,L115202,u4310,m287,MERRICK,Wait!
147658,L115201,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
147659,L115200,u4310,m287,MERRICK,You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
147660,L115199,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes."
147661,L115198,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?"
147662,L115197,u4310,m287,MERRICK,To bring you... your birthright.
147663,L115196,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Why?
147664,L115195,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy."
147665,L115194,u4300,m287,BUFFY,What are you talking about?
147666,L115193,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared."
147667,L115192,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Am I in trouble or something?
147668,L115191,u4310,m287,MERRICK,"I'm looking for you, actually."
147669,L115190,u4300,m287,BUFFY,What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
147670,L115189,u4310,m287,MERRICK,I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
147671,L115188,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death."
147672,L115703,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Oh.
147673,L115702,u4311,m287,NICOLE,I haven't seen him tonight.
147674,L115701,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here."
147675,L115700,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Hi.
147676,L115699,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Hi, guys."
147677,L115660,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Later for it.
147678,L115659,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Nicole...
147679,L115658,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Well, I guess you got what you came for."
147680,L115639,u4311,m287,NICOLE,You're having a fling with him?
147681,L115638,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Pike.
147682,L115550,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Sorry.
147683,L115549,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps."
147684,L115265,u4311,m287,NICOLE,You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
147685,L115264,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Thanks.
147686,L115263,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed."
147687,L115187,u4300,m287,BUFFY,B'bye.
147688,L115186,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys."
147689,L115185,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come."
147690,L115182,u4311,m287,NICOLE,I guess.
147691,L115181,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Yeah... She's okay, though."
147692,L115180,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Cassandra's really smart.
147693,L115179,u4300,m287,BUFFY,You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
147694,L115176,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to."
147695,L115175,u4311,m287,NICOLE,I don't get it.
147696,L115172,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
147697,L115171,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Thank you very much.
147698,L115170,u4300,m287,BUFFY,That is so cool.
147699,L115157,u4311,m287,NICOLE,No.  It was mondo bizarro.
147700,L115156,u4300,m287,BUFFY,I was just scared is all.
147701,L115155,u4311,m287,NICOLE,-- like she's gonna kill me.
147702,L115142,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half."
147703,L115141,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Come one, that was so weird."
147704,L115087,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Cassandra, you gotta come, too."
147705,L115086,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
147706,L114956,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Good enough!
147707,L114955,u4300,m287,BUFFY,That's the plan.
147708,L114954,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?"
147709,L114942,u4311,m287,NICOLE,They don't even have Dolby.
147710,L114941,u4300,m287,BUFFY,No THX.
147711,L114930,u4300,m287,BUFFY,Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
147712,L114929,u4311,m287,NICOLE,You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
147713,L114928,u4300,m287,BUFFY,"Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie."
147714,L115282,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,Swear to God.
147715,L115281,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,Really?
147716,L115280,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,"No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful."
147717,L115273,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,"Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels."
147718,L115272,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,What... are you?
147719,L115271,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,"Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn."
147720,L115270,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,My parents have money...
147721,L115269,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,So very much.
147722,L115268,u4302,m287,CASSANDRA,What's happening?  What do you want?
147723,L115267,u4308,m287,LOTHOS,"I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me."
147724,L114921,u4309,m287,MAN,You are much more.
147725,L114920,u4303,m287,GIRL,I'm just a girl.
147726,L114919,u4309,m287,MAN,"But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called."
147727,L114918,u4309,m287,MAN,"Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us."
147728,L114917,u4303,m287,GIRL,I don't understand.
147729,L114916,u4309,m287,MAN,The mark of the Coven.
147730,L114915,u4309,m287,MAN,She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
147731,L114914,u4303,m287,GIRL,Why?  Why me?
147732,L114913,u4309,m287,MAN,You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
147733,L114912,u4303,m287,GIRL,I can't!
147734,L115003,u4304,m287,GRUELLER,Good.
147735,L115002,u4313,m287,WALLY,Got that.
147736,L115001,u4304,m287,GRUELLER,"Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?"
147737,L115000,u4313,m287,WALLY,Could be.
147738,L114999,u4304,m287,GRUELLER,You think so?
147739,L114998,u4313,m287,WALLY,Could be.
147740,L114997,u4304,m287,GRUELLER,What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
147741,L114996,u4313,m287,WALLY,"Hi, Grueller."
147742,L114995,u4304,m287,GRUELLER,Bessel!  What are you doing here?
147743,L115832,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,I heard she got straight A's.
147744,L115831,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
147745,L115783,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,But --
147746,L115782,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Okay, let's go."
147747,L115781,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,No --
147748,L115780,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Well, I'm done.  Are you done?"
147749,L115779,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,Jeffrey!
147750,L115778,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,Buffy?
147751,L115776,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
147752,L115775,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,"Oh, baby!"
147753,L115774,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,"Oh, yes!  Yes!"
147754,L115066,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,"Okay, what else?"
147755,L115065,u4305,m287,JEFFREY,Write that down.
147756,L115830,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Buffy?
147757,L115829,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,"She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her."
147758,L115653,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Okay.
147759,L115652,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,And Spring Fling.
147760,L115620,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Throw it out.
147761,L115619,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
147762,L115426,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
147763,L115425,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Well, I hope so."
147764,L115424,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,"So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing."
147765,L115144,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,Where'd you learn how to do that?
147766,L115143,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,I can't believe they still ate it.
147767,L115632,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,Does Jeffrey know?
147768,L115631,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Cool!
147769,L115566,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,What is she...
147770,L115565,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Buffy!
147771,L115178,u4311,m287,NICOLE,I gotta bail.  You coming?
147772,L115177,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,I never thought of that.
147773,L115154,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --"
147774,L115153,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,"Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit."
147775,L115152,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels."
147776,L115151,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,You're kidding.
147777,L115150,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke."
147778,L115149,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,What happened?
147779,L114940,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Nee sitch.  No way.
147780,L114939,u4306,m287,JENNIFER,Omniplex?
147781,L115754,u4312,m287,PIKE,You want some punch?
147782,L115753,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,They'll kill us!
147783,L115123,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Hey, wait a minute..."
147784,L115122,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
147785,L115121,u4312,m287,PIKE,I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
147786,L115120,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Wit-tay.
147787,L115119,u4312,m287,PIKE,"The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though."
147788,L115709,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?"
147789,L115708,u4311,m287,NICOLE,It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
147790,L115655,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do."
147791,L115654,u4311,m287,NICOLE,And the January Semi-formal --
147792,L115651,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Right.
147793,L115650,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Except for Prom.
147794,L115649,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year."
147795,L115648,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"So, we're stupid now?"
147796,L115644,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --"
147797,L115643,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Like you've got a grip.
147798,L115642,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Oh, thank you very much."
147799,L115637,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game."
147800,L115636,u4311,m287,NICOLE,What are you talking about?
147801,L115623,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental."
147802,L115622,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?"
147803,L115621,u4311,m287,NICOLE,I really was way way too too.
147804,L115159,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?"
147805,L115158,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Buffy, the ape-woman."
147806,L115110,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Nice much.
147807,L115109,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Smell of booze much.
147808,L115098,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Well, look who's here."
147809,L115097,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
147810,L115096,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that."
147811,L115072,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Right!
147812,L115071,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Oh, yeah!"
147813,L115061,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Okay.
147814,L115060,u4311,m287,NICOLE,Environment.  That's cool with me.
147815,L115040,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,"Oh, please."
147816,L115039,u4311,m287,NICOLE,The homelesses?
147817,L114970,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,Like we don't have rights too?
147818,L114969,u4311,m287,NICOLE,God!  Take a chill lozenge.
147819,L114963,u4307,m287,KIMBERLY,He is so bald.
147820,L114962,u4311,m287,NICOLE,"Oh, God."
147821,L115464,u4312,m287,PIKE,Run.
147822,L115463,u4314,m287,ZEPH,Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
147823,L115462,u4312,m287,PIKE,I am.
147824,L115461,u4314,m287,ZEPH,All right.  Take care of yourself.
147825,L115460,u4312,m287,PIKE,I don't think so.
147826,L115459,u4314,m287,ZEPH,"Ah, you'll be coming back."
147827,L115458,u4312,m287,PIKE,"You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird."
147828,L115457,u4314,m287,ZEPH,No...  You want me to give him a message?
147829,L115456,u4312,m287,PIKE,"Hey, have you seen Benny lately?"
147830,L115455,u4314,m287,ZEPH,Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
147831,L115454,u4312,m287,PIKE,"I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy."
147832,L115453,u4314,m287,ZEPH,What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
147833,L117556,u4325,m288,NUKE,Don't worry.
147834,L117555,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
147835,L117554,u4325,m288,NUKE,I think I'm ready for the Show.
147836,L117553,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Neither will I.
147837,L117552,u4325,m288,NUKE,I won't be needing these anymore.
147838,L117551,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Well I guess this is it.
147839,L117480,u4325,m288,NUKE,How can I possibly thank you?
147840,L117479,u4315,m288,ANNIE,That's great!
147841,L117478,u4325,m288,NUKE,I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
147842,L117474,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez..."
147843,L117473,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"It's Skip, for you."
147844,L117470,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--"
147845,L117469,u4315,m288,ANNIE,--but you're father's in there!
147846,L117468,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--"
147847,L117467,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--"
147848,L117466,u4325,m288,NUKE,I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
147849,L117465,u4315,m288,ANNIE,You don't have to...
147850,L117464,u4325,m288,NUKE,I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
147851,L117456,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Oh--won't YOU come in?
147852,L117455,u4325,m288,NUKE,I'd like you to meet my father.
147853,L117454,u4315,m288,ANNIE,it's okay..
147854,L117453,u4325,m288,NUKE,We lost.
147855,L117347,u4325,m288,NUKE,I'll be back when we lose.
147856,L117346,u4315,m288,ANNIE,He did?
147857,L117345,u4325,m288,NUKE,He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
147858,L117344,u4315,m288,ANNIE,What'd he say?
147859,L117343,u4325,m288,NUKE,I did.
147860,L117342,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
147861,L117341,u4325,m288,NUKE,You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
147862,L117340,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
147863,L117339,u4325,m288,NUKE,I think you're real cute.
147864,L117338,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?"
147865,L117337,u4325,m288,NUKE,I knew it--you're seducing me!
147866,L117336,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I'm trying to play with your body!
147867,L117335,u4325,m288,NUKE,No!  You're playing with my mind!
147868,L117330,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try."
147869,L117329,u4325,m288,NUKE,He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
147870,L117328,u4315,m288,ANNIE,What a nasty thing to say.
147871,L117327,u4325,m288,NUKE,Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
147872,L117326,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Yes I do...
147873,L117325,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a ""V"" shape?--"
147874,L117324,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
147875,L117323,u4325,m288,NUKE,Fundamentals?
147876,L117322,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
147877,L117321,u4325,m288,NUKE,I know what it is.
147878,L117320,u4315,m288,ANNIE,That's my leg.
147879,L117318,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie..."
147880,L117317,u4325,m288,NUKE,You can't seduce me.
147881,L117316,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I'll tuck you in.
147882,L117315,u4325,m288,NUKE,"No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap."
147883,L117314,u4315,m288,ANNIE,How 'bout a back rub?
147884,L117313,u4325,m288,NUKE,"No, no, it was great."
147885,L117312,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
147886,L117283,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Ebby Calvin ""Nuke"" LaLoosh--"
147887,L117282,u4325,m288,NUKE,No.
147888,L117281,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Get over here.
147889,L117280,u4325,m288,NUKE,Just till I lose.
147890,L117279,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Nuke?!
147891,L117278,u4325,m288,NUKE,You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
147892,L117277,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?"
147893,L117276,u4325,m288,NUKE,Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
147894,L117275,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--"
147895,L117274,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games."
147896,L117273,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I'm yours.
147897,L117220,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?"
147898,L117219,u4325,m288,NUKE,Death is like spring training?
147899,L117218,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
147900,L117217,u4325,m288,NUKE,God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
147901,L117214,u4315,m288,ANNIE,It's all the same thing.
147902,L117213,u4325,m288,NUKE,I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
147903,L117210,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
147904,L117209,u4325,m288,NUKE,How ya like that?
147905,L117208,u4325,m288,NUKE,Gimme the God damn ball!
147906,L117207,u4315,m288,ANNIE,A little better.
147907,L117206,u4325,m288,NUKE,How was that?
147908,L117205,u4315,m288,ANNIE,He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
147909,L117204,u4325,m288,NUKE,If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
147910,L117203,u4315,m288,ANNIE,You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
147911,L117202,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there."
147912,L117201,u4325,m288,NUKE,Switch nostrils?
147913,L117200,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch."
147914,L117199,u4325,m288,NUKE,"I'm really beat.  I need some serious ""z's""--"
147915,L117198,u4315,m288,ANNIE,The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
147916,L117197,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"There are two important psychic conduits called the ""pingala"" and the ""ida"".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril."
147917,L117196,u4325,m288,NUKE,My right nostril?
147918,L117195,u4315,m288,ANNIE,The right nostril.  Good.
147919,L117194,u4325,m288,NUKE,Which nostril am I breathing through?
147920,L117193,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?"
147921,L117192,u4325,m288,NUKE,This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
147922,L117189,u4325,m288,NUKE,Catch?
147923,L117188,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
147924,L117187,u4325,m288,NUKE,Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
147925,L117186,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"What is this ""I, I, I"" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?"
147926,L117185,u4325,m288,NUKE,God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
147927,L117083,u4315,m288,ANNIE,They did when they were in the Carolina League.
147928,L117082,u4325,m288,NUKE,Big League pitchers don't use these.
147929,L117081,u4315,m288,ANNIE,You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
147930,L117080,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Jesus, Annie, I don't know--"
147931,L117079,u4315,m288,ANNIE,They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
147932,L117078,u4325,m288,NUKE,What?
147933,L117077,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
147934,L117002,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game."
147935,L117001,u4325,m288,NUKE,"God, I never thought of that."
147936,L117000,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
147937,L116999,u4325,m288,NUKE,"I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that..."
147938,L116998,u4315,m288,ANNIE,You can learn to like it.
147939,L116997,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do..."
147940,L116996,u4315,m288,ANNIE,You see how nice things are when we go slow?
147941,L116995,u4325,m288,NUKE,Yeah maybe you're right.
147942,L116994,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?"
147943,L116993,u4325,m288,NUKE,"You said ""Crash""."
147944,L116992,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things."
147945,L116991,u4325,m288,NUKE,"You said ""Crash""."
147946,L116990,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"I didn't say ""Crash"".  I said Nuke."
147947,L116989,u4325,m288,NUKE,"You mean Nuke.  You said ""Crash""."
147948,L117424,u4315,m288,ANNIE,We all deserve to wear white.
147949,L117423,u4324,m288,MILLIE,Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
147950,L117422,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?"
147951,L117421,u4324,m288,MILLIE,You should be at the game.
147952,L117395,u4324,m288,MILLIE,He's a virgin.
147953,L117394,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you."
147954,L116790,u4324,m288,MILLIE,"Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place"
147955,L116789,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?"
147956,L116771,u4315,m288,ANNIE,That's better.  Got the radar ready?
147957,L116770,u4324,m288,MILLIE,"""I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions""."
147958,L116769,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"You didn't get ""lured"".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--""I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions""."
147959,L116768,u4324,m288,MILLIE,I got lured.
147960,L116767,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble."
147961,L117605,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"I can do that, too."
147962,L117604,u4317,m288,CRASH,I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
147963,L117603,u4315,m288,ANNIE,What?
147964,L117602,u4317,m288,CRASH,Annie---
147965,L117601,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-""non-time kind of time"" to it..."
147966,L117600,u4317,m288,CRASH,You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
147967,L117599,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
147968,L117598,u4317,m288,CRASH,Yeah...you a witch?
147969,L117597,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?"
147970,L117596,u4317,m288,CRASH,There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
147971,L117595,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball."
147972,L117594,u4317,m288,CRASH,I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
147973,L117593,u4315,m288,ANNIE,What happened?
147974,L117579,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?"
147975,L117578,u4317,m288,CRASH,"How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?"
147976,L117577,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?"
147977,L117575,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I heard already.
147978,L117574,u4317,m288,CRASH,I got released.
147979,L117390,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Whatta you mean ""why not""?  Are you gonna play forever?!"
147980,L117389,u4317,m288,CRASH,Why not?
147981,L117388,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
147982,L117387,u4317,m288,CRASH,Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
147983,L117386,u4315,m288,ANNIE,No.
147984,L117385,u4317,m288,CRASH,It's possible.
147985,L117384,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?"
147986,L117383,u4317,m288,CRASH,I don't know if I'd go that far.
147987,L117382,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!"
147988,L117381,u4317,m288,CRASH,What's so great about baseball?
147989,L117380,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
147990,L117379,u4317,m288,CRASH,Who?
147991,L117378,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him."
147992,L117375,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
147993,L117374,u4317,m288,CRASH,Why baseball?
147994,L117372,u4317,m288,CRASH,You okay?
147995,L117371,u4315,m288,ANNIE,God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
147996,L117370,u4317,m288,CRASH,"Annie, I think you should leave."
147997,L117369,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"I said when I think about you, I get wet."
147998,L117368,u4317,m288,CRASH,"--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms."
147999,L117367,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I'm ready for a complicated man.
148000,L117366,u4317,m288,CRASH,"I thought you wanted an ""uncomplicated"" boy?"
148001,L117365,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Crash, I get wet just thinking about you."
148002,L117364,u4317,m288,CRASH,I doubt that.
148003,L117363,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
148004,L117362,u4317,m288,CRASH,And now you wanta teach me?
148005,L117361,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
148006,L117360,u4317,m288,CRASH,Who are you?  Do you have a job?
148007,L117359,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I want you desperately!
148008,L117358,u4317,m288,CRASH,And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
148009,L117357,u4315,m288,ANNIE,He won't make love to me anymore.
148010,L117356,u4317,m288,CRASH,"I think of you and the ""boy"" all the time."
148011,L117355,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I want to be had.
148012,L117354,u4317,m288,CRASH,"You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!"
148013,L117353,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Don't you think I'm pretty?
148014,L117352,u4317,m288,CRASH,Aren't we all?
148015,L117351,u4315,m288,ANNIE,He' s confused--
148016,L117350,u4317,m288,CRASH,"Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?"
148017,L117349,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Crash...I want you.
148018,L116979,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
148019,L116978,u4317,m288,CRASH,A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
148020,L116977,u4315,m288,ANNIE,You got me all confused.
148021,L116976,u4317,m288,CRASH,"Well, Annie, your place or mine?"
148022,L116973,u4317,m288,CRASH,Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
148023,L116972,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous."
148024,L116971,u4317,m288,CRASH,Your place or mine?
148025,L116970,u4317,m288,CRASH,Let me.
148026,L116969,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Damn.
148027,L116968,u4317,m288,CRASH,No.  Please.
148028,L116967,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it."
148029,L116966,u4317,m288,CRASH,"247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it."
148030,L116965,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
148031,L116964,u4317,m288,CRASH,Don't tell anybody.
148032,L116963,u4315,m288,ANNIE,But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
148033,L116962,u4317,m288,CRASH,You're pulling your hips out.
148034,L116961,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Damn.
148035,L116960,u4317,m288,CRASH,That's my job too.
148036,L116959,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not ""dim"".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him ""life-wisdom"" and help him make it to the major leagues."
148037,L116958,u4317,m288,CRASH,"What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,"
148038,L116957,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
148039,L116956,u4317,m288,CRASH,So...Wanta make love?
148040,L116955,u4315,m288,ANNIE,But you were pulling your hips last night.
148041,L116954,u4317,m288,CRASH,When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
148042,L116953,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
148043,L116952,u4317,m288,CRASH,Yep.
148044,L116951,u4315,m288,ANNIE,See my hips?
148045,L116895,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I'm not interested yet.
148046,L116894,u4317,m288,CRASH,I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
148047,L116893,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'."
148048,L116891,u4317,m288,CRASH,G'night.
148049,L116890,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Oh my...  Don't leave...
148050,L116889,u4317,m288,CRASH,"I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the ""sweet spot"", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days."
148051,L116888,u4315,m288,ANNIE,What do you believe in?
148052,L116887,u4317,m288,CRASH,"After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins."
148053,L116884,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
148054,L116883,u4317,m288,CRASH,Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
148055,L116882,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other."
148056,L116853,u4317,m288,CRASH,I'll learn.  C'mon--
148057,L116852,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Crash, I didn't think you--"
148058,L116851,u4317,m288,CRASH,She's dancing with me.
148059,L116843,u4315,m288,ANNIE,I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
148060,L116842,u4317,m288,CRASH,I don't dance.
148061,L116841,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
148062,L116840,u4317,m288,CRASH,I'm Crash Davis.
148063,L117269,u4320,m288,JACKSON,He'll learn.
148064,L117268,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake..."
148065,L117243,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"He looks wonderful, Jackson..."
148066,L117242,u4320,m288,JACKSON,Ninety-three miles an hour.
148067,L117191,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign."
148068,L117190,u4320,m288,JACKSON,"Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--"
148069,L117044,u4320,m288,JACKSON,Ninety-five miles an hour...
148070,L117043,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Oh dear....easy honey...

148079,L117484,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ..."

148084,L117461,u4326,m288,NUKE'S FATHER,"We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman."

148086,L117458,u4315,m288,ANNIE,Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?

148094,L116910,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?"
148095,L116907,u4315,m288,ANNIE,You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
148096,L116906,u4318,m288,EBBY,The socks?  It's cold in here.
148097,L116905,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks."

148107,L116879,u4315,m288,ANNIE,"Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being ""re-channeled"" but I believe in ""re-channeling"" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?"
148108,L116850,u4318,m288,EBBY,That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?

148146,L117546,u4325,m288,NUKE,Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
148147,L117545,u4317,m288,CRASH,I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
148148,L117544,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know..."
148149,L117543,u4325,m288,NUKE,I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.

148152,L117540,u4317,m288,CRASH,"You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance."
148153,L117539,u4325,m288,NUKE,No.
148154,L117538,u4317,m288,CRASH,"I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?"

148157,L117534,u4317,m288,CRASH,"If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up."
148158,L117533,u4325,m288,NUKE,What?
148159,L117532,u4317,m288,CRASH,Good.  Good.  That's terrific...

148161,L117530,u4317,m288,CRASH,Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
148162,L117527,u4317,m288,CRASH,"You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!"
148163,L117526,u4325,m288,NUKE,I'll take you back to the hotel.

148169,L117519,u4325,m288,NUKE,Why am I a fuck?
148170,L117518,u4317,m288,CRASH,You fuck!
148171,L117517,u4325,m288,NUKE,"C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about."
148172,L117516,u4317,m288,CRASH,"God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside."
148173,L117515,u4325,m288,NUKE,"I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--"

148180,L117504,u4317,m288,CRASH,"Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness..."
148181,L117503,u4325,m288,NUKE,Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
148182,L117409,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch."
148183,L117408,u4317,m288,CRASH,"Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck."

148186,L117306,u4317,m288,CRASH,You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
148187,L117305,u4325,m288,NUKE,She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
148188,L117304,u4317,m288,CRASH,Yep.  So how's Annie?
148189,L117303,u4325,m288,NUKE,"""...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."""

148201,L117261,u4325,m288,NUKE,You're the boss.
148202,L117260,u4317,m288,CRASH,It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.

148206,L117252,u4317,m288,CRASH,"The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--"
148207,L117251,u4325,m288,NUKE,Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
148208,L117250,u4317,m288,CRASH,Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.

148210,L117223,u4317,m288,CRASH,Annie's a smart lady.
148211,L117222,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for."
148212,L117184,u4317,m288,CRASH,"I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home."
148213,L117183,u4325,m288,NUKE,I was playing naked.
148214,L117180,u4317,m288,CRASH,"If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him."
148215,L117179,u4325,m288,NUKE,What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
148216,L117178,u4317,m288,CRASH,What?
148217,L117177,u4325,m288,NUKE,Can I ask you something?
148218,L117161,u4325,m288,NUKE,God--what a Big League move.

148221,L117138,u4325,m288,NUKE,"If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?"
148222,L117137,u4317,m288,CRASH,Go for it.
148223,L117136,u4325,m288,NUKE,"You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad."
148224,L117135,u4317,m288,CRASH,I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
148225,L117134,u4325,m288,NUKE,You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
148226,L117133,u4317,m288,CRASH,"By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands."

148230,L117105,u4325,m288,NUKE,"God damn it I'm sick of you calling me ""Meat""!  You wanta step outside!"
148231,L117104,u4317,m288,CRASH,"You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat."

148234,L117098,u4317,m288,CRASH,"You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball."
148235,L117097,u4325,m288,NUKE,I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
148236,L117096,u4317,m288,CRASH,You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
148237,L117095,u4317,m288,CRASH,A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
148238,L117094,u4325,m288,NUKE,What do I got?
148239,L117093,u4317,m288,CRASH,"'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift."
148240,L117092,u4325,m288,NUKE,How come you don't like me?
148241,L117089,u4317,m288,CRASH,Gimme that.
148242,L117088,u4325,m288,NUKE,"Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress..."
148243,L117040,u4317,m288,CRASH,I told him.
148244,L117039,u4325,m288,NUKE,How?

148414,L121099,u4331,m289,ACE,It's a pity in this...
148415,L121098,u4369,m289,STONE,"He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind."
148416,L119590,u4369,m289,STONE,Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
148417,L119589,u4331,m289,ACE,I'm serious. No interference.

148420,L119586,u4369,m289,STONE,"Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license."
148421,L119585,u4331,m289,ACE,But what happens when they do find out?
148422,L119584,u4369,m289,STONE,You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
148423,L119573,u4369,m289,STONE,"...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers."
148424,L119572,u4331,m289,ACE,But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...

148426,L119570,u4331,m289,ACE,He even played golf with the President.
148427,L119569,u4369,m289,STONE,"Philip, if you would rise."
148428,L119568,u4331,m289,ACE,A powerful man.
148429,L119567,u4369,m289,STONE,This is a very auspicious occasion.

148490,L120135,u4335,m289,BANKER,That's right.
148491,L120134,u4331,m289,ACE,"So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?"

148535,L121334,u4359,m289,NICKY,"I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?"

148554,L121171,u4331,m289,ACE,"Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you."
148555,L121170,u4359,m289,NICKY,You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
148556,L121169,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right."
148557,L121168,u4359,m289,NICKY,Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
148558,L121167,u4331,m289,ACE,I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.

148564,L121161,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass."
148565,L121160,u4359,m289,NICKY,You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
148566,L121159,u4331,m289,ACE,"I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem."
148567,L121158,u4359,m289,NICKY,"No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!"
148568,L121157,u4331,m289,ACE,"I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick."
148569,L121156,u4359,m289,NICKY,"What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?"
148570,L121155,u4331,m289,ACE,What people?
148571,L121154,u4359,m289,NICKY,Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?

148579,L120933,u4331,m289,ACE,And at the...
148580,L120932,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Practice enough this week, you prick?"
148581,L120931,u4331,m289,ACE,"...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf."
148582,L120926,u4331,m289,ACE,"The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care."
148583,L120925,u4359,m289,NICKY,"I see you, you motherfuckers."
148584,L120924,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Peekaboo, you fucks, you."
148585,L120899,u4359,m289,NICKY,"The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too."
148586,L120898,u4331,m289,ACE,"Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses."
148587,L120889,u4331,m289,ACE,"Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody."
148588,L120888,u4359,m289,NICKY,Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
148589,L120887,u4331,m289,ACE,"I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it."
148590,L120886,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal."
148591,L120885,u4331,m289,ACE,This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
148592,L120884,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy."
148593,L120883,u4359,m289,NICKY,"A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me."
148594,L120882,u4331,m289,ACE,"That's right, yeah."
148595,L120881,u4359,m289,NICKY,It's none of my business?
148596,L120880,u4331,m289,ACE,"Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that."
148597,L120879,u4359,m289,NICKY,"And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?"
148598,L120878,u4331,m289,ACE,Okay?
148599,L120877,u4359,m289,NICKY,She came to talk to me...
148600,L120876,u4331,m289,ACE,...don't do it to me...
148601,L120875,u4359,m289,NICKY,...to me.
148602,L120874,u4331,m289,ACE,Please...
148603,L120873,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Hey, she came to talk..."
148604,L120872,u4331,m289,ACE,"I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you."
148605,L120871,u4359,m289,NICKY,The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
148606,L120870,u4331,m289,ACE,"Listen, I would -"
148607,L120869,u4359,m289,NICKY,"No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point."
148608,L120868,u4331,m289,ACE,"All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?"
148609,L120867,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident."
148610,L120866,u4331,m289,ACE,"Now, what does she have to do with all this?"
148611,L120865,u4359,m289,NICKY,Yeah.
148612,L120864,u4331,m289,ACE,My wife?
148613,L120863,u4359,m289,NICKY,"You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife."
148614,L120862,u4331,m289,ACE,Yeah.
148615,L120861,u4359,m289,NICKY,"...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!"
148616,L120860,u4331,m289,ACE,All right.
148617,L120859,u4359,m289,NICKY,A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
148618,L120858,u4331,m289,ACE,All right.
148619,L120857,u4359,m289,NICKY,Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
148620,L120856,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yes, you lost your control."
148621,L120855,u4359,m289,NICKY,I lost control?
148622,L120854,u4331,m289,ACE,You lost your control.
148623,L120853,u4359,m289,NICKY,Yeah.
148624,L120852,u4331,m289,ACE,What happened to me? What happened to you?
148625,L120851,u4359,m289,NICKY,What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
148626,L120850,u4331,m289,ACE,Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
148627,L120849,u4359,m289,NICKY,Yeah?
148628,L120848,u4331,m289,ACE,Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
148629,L120847,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad."
148630,L120846,u4331,m289,ACE,I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
148631,L120845,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Yeah, that's out of context. Okay."
148632,L120844,u4331,m289,ACE,That's all taken out of context. Okay.
148633,L120843,u4359,m289,NICKY,"You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?"
148634,L120842,u4331,m289,ACE,...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
148635,L120841,u4359,m289,NICKY,Fine.
148636,L120840,u4331,m289,ACE,I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
148637,L120839,u4359,m289,NICKY,"All right, fine."
148638,L120838,u4331,m289,ACE,I'll be honest with you.
148639,L120837,u4359,m289,NICKY,Just say so.
148640,L120836,u4331,m289,ACE,I don't wanna come along with you.
148641,L120835,u4359,m289,NICKY,You should say so.
148642,L120834,u4331,m289,ACE,"No, I don't wanna come -"
148643,L120833,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?"
148644,L120832,u4331,m289,ACE,"Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?"
148645,L120831,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way."
148646,L120830,u4331,m289,ACE,"I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?"
148647,L120829,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time."
148648,L120828,u4331,m289,ACE,"What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI."
148649,L120827,u4359,m289,NICKY,You think he got the point?
148650,L120810,u4331,m289,ACE,Hey.
148651,L120809,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Hey, Ace."
148652,L120796,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine."
148653,L120795,u4331,m289,ACE,...very difficult to get in.
148654,L120794,u4331,m289,ACE,"It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's..."
148655,L120793,u4359,m289,NICKY,"No, no it's okay."
148656,L120787,u4359,m289,NICKY,Listen...
148657,L120786,u4331,m289,ACE,Hello.
148658,L120461,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?"
148659,L120460,u4331,m289,ACE,"- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy."
148660,L120412,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Hey, Rich."
148661,L120411,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them."
148662,L120327,u4359,m289,NICKY,I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
148663,L120326,u4331,m289,ACE,"It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care."
148664,L120325,u4331,m289,ACE,"In so many words, yes."
148665,L120324,u4359,m289,NICKY,"In other words, I'm fucked."
148666,L120323,u4331,m289,ACE,Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
148667,L120322,u4359,m289,NICKY,Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
148668,L120321,u4331,m289,ACE,"Nope, there's no way."
148669,L120320,u4359,m289,NICKY,Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
148670,L120318,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yeah, I believe it. You got banned."
148671,L120317,u4359,m289,NICKY,' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
148672,L120316,u4359,m289,NICKY,What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
148673,L120315,u4331,m289,ACE,"Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it."
148674,L120255,u4359,m289,NICKY,All right.
148675,L120254,u4331,m289,ACE,I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
148676,L120253,u4359,m289,NICKY,"What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all."
148677,L120252,u4331,m289,ACE,"Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you."
148678,L120251,u4359,m289,NICKY,That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
148679,L120250,u4331,m289,ACE,I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
148680,L120249,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Why, somebody's complaining?"
148681,L120248,u4331,m289,ACE,You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
148682,L120244,u4331,m289,ACE,Between...
148683,L120243,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him."
148684,L120224,u4331,m289,ACE,You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
148685,L120223,u4359,m289,NICKY,"But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons."
148686,L120219,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Thanks, pal."
148687,L120218,u4331,m289,ACE,Okay.
148688,L120217,u4359,m289,NICKY,"All right, Ace?"
148689,L120216,u4359,m289,NICKY,I'm sorry about this. Really.
148690,L120215,u4331,m289,ACE,"If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again."
148691,L120200,u4359,m289,NICKY,"What? Ho-  Hey, come here."
148692,L120199,u4331,m289,ACE,So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
148693,L120198,u4331,m289,ACE,Then he called me a faggot.
148694,L120197,u4359,m289,NICKY,What?
148695,L120196,u4331,m289,ACE,...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
148696,L120195,u4331,m289,ACE,He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
148697,L120194,u4359,m289,NICKY,No.
148698,L120193,u4331,m289,ACE,"No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?"
148699,L120167,u4331,m289,ACE,You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
148700,L120166,u4359,m289,NICKY,"So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?"
148701,L120165,u4331,m289,ACE,Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
148702,L120164,u4331,m289,ACE,"I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that."
148703,L120158,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Four aces, Doc."
148704,L120157,u4331,m289,ACE,And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
148705,L120149,u4331,m289,ACE,"It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy."
148706,L120148,u4359,m289,NICKY,"...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players."
148707,L120143,u4359,m289,NICKY,"To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers."
148708,L120142,u4331,m289,ACE,...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
148709,L120066,u4359,m289,NICKY,"It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her -"
148710,L120065,u4331,m289,ACE,"When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'"
148711,L119946,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure."
148712,L119945,u4331,m289,ACE,"Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message."
148713,L119944,u4331,m289,ACE,"And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known."
148714,L119943,u4359,m289,NICKY,Ohh!
148715,L119908,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle."
148716,L119907,u4359,m289,NICKY,"But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose."
148717,L119903,u4359,m289,NICKY,Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
148718,L119902,u4331,m289,ACE,"Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit."
148719,L119901,u4359,m289,NICKY,I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
148720,L119900,u4331,m289,ACE,"Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here."
148721,L119899,u4359,m289,NICKY,"You mean, I have your permission?"
148722,L119898,u4331,m289,ACE,"No, of course not."
148723,L119897,u4359,m289,NICKY,What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
148724,L119896,u4331,m289,ACE,"After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it."
148725,L119889,u4331,m289,ACE,"Honey, come here."
148726,L119888,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?"
148727,L119887,u4331,m289,ACE,Ginger.
148728,L119886,u4359,m289,NICKY,Yeah.
148729,L119885,u4331,m289,ACE,"Somethin', huh?"
148730,L119884,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Okay, Sammy."
148731,L119875,u4331,m289,ACE,Hey.
148732,L119874,u4359,m289,NICKY,...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
148733,L119848,u4331,m289,ACE,"I mean, he took care of himself only too well. And that's why every badge back home wanted to nail him."
148734,L119847,u4359,m289,NICKY,"You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you."
148735,L119846,u4331,m289,ACE,But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
148736,L119677,u4359,m289,NICKY,Listen...
148737,L119676,u4331,m289,ACE,"While I was tryin' to figure out why the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', Nicky just hit him. No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on. You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat. You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun. And you beat him with a gun, you better kill him, because he'll keep comin' back and back until one of you is dead."
148738,L119675,u4331,m289,ACE,"Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy."
148739,L119674,u4359,m289,NICKY,"What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!"
148740,L119661,u4359,m289,NICKY,"If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight."
148741,L119660,u4331,m289,ACE,Eight.
148742,L119659,u4359,m289,NICKY,It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
148743,L119651,u4331,m289,ACE,How did Nicky collect?
148744,L119650,u4359,m289,NICKY,They payin'?
148745,L119649,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us."
148746,L119605,u4359,m289,NICKY,If his girlfriend was knocked up.
148747,L119604,u4331,m289,ACE,I'll take Columbia for twenty.
148748,L119598,u4331,m289,ACE,Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
148749,L119597,u4359,m289,NICKY,He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
148750,L119596,u4331,m289,ACE,Where the hell did you learn how to deal?
148751,L119595,u4359,m289,NICKY,"You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that."
148752,L119583,u4331,m289,ACE,"You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me."
148753,L119582,u4359,m289,NICKY,...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
148754,L119519,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night."
148755,L119518,u4331,m289,ACE,But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
148756,L119513,u4359,m289,NICKY,Matter of fact...
148757,L119512,u4331,m289,ACE,"...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details."
148758,L120674,u4373,m289,WEBB,You bet.
148759,L120673,u4331,m289,ACE,No problem.  Sorry.
148760,L120672,u4373,m289,WEBB,"Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time."
148761,L120671,u4331,m289,ACE,"Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry."
148762,L120670,u4331,m289,ACE,"I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted."
148763,L120669,u4373,m289,WEBB,"Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?"
148764,L120668,u4331,m289,ACE,"I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that."
148765,L120667,u4373,m289,WEBB,"You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back."
148766,L120666,u4331,m289,ACE,"I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him."
148767,L120665,u4373,m289,WEBB,"Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?"
148768,L120664,u4331,m289,ACE,"Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest."
148769,L120663,u4373,m289,WEBB,"Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges."
148770,L120662,u4331,m289,ACE,"I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here."
148771,L120661,u4373,m289,WEBB,"Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired."
148772,L120657,u4331,m289,ACE,"No, that's quite all right."
148773,L120656,u4373,m289,WEBB,"Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant."
148774,L120655,u4373,m289,WEBB,"Oh, thank you, sir."
148775,L120654,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yeah, I heard a lot about you."
148776,L120653,u4373,m289,WEBB,"Hey, it is my pleasure."
148777,L120652,u4331,m289,ACE,How do you do?
148778,L120651,u4373,m289,WEBB,Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
148779,L119632,u4331,m289,ACE,Seven o'clock.
148780,L119631,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Seven o'clock?
148781,L119630,u4331,m289,ACE,I'll come by.
148782,L119629,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Okay. You come by the house?
148783,L119628,u4331,m289,ACE,"Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?"
148784,L119627,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?"
148785,L119626,u4331,m289,ACE,"Well, that's why they paid so well."
148786,L119625,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
148787,L121526,u4331,m289,ACE,"Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -"
148788,L121525,u4353,m289,JENNIFER,Hello.
148789,L121120,u4331,m289,ACE,"Next morning bright and early, I get the call."
148790,L121119,u4353,m289,JENNIFER,Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
148791,L121118,u4331,m289,ACE,"...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car."
148792,L121117,u4353,m289,JENNIFER,"You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis."
148793,L119891,u4353,m289,JENNIFER,Good to meet you.
148794,L119890,u4331,m289,ACE,This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
148795,L119863,u4353,m289,JENNIFER,"All right, we're clear."
148796,L119862,u4331,m289,ACE,"I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas."
148797,L119861,u4353,m289,JENNIFER,Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
148798,L119860,u4331,m289,ACE,"Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it."
148799,L119857,u4331,m289,ACE,And they were usually right.
148800,L119856,u4353,m289,JENNIFER,You go and put your things away.
148801,L119855,u4331,m289,ACE,"They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened."
148802,L119854,u4353,m289,JENNIFER,"Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?"
148803,L121861,u4331,m289,ACE,Half - I'm comin' down.
148804,L121860,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,"Ace, listen to me."
148805,L121859,u4331,m289,ACE,Half of everything is mine.
148806,L121858,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,"No, Ace."
148807,L121857,u4331,m289,ACE,"Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff."
148808,L121851,u4331,m289,ACE,She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders-
148809,L121850,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,What can I do?
148810,L121849,u4331,m289,ACE,You've got to stop her.
148811,L121848,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,"I-I'm sorry, Sam."
148812,L121847,u4331,m289,ACE,"Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!"
148813,L120812,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,"Yeah, refill'd be great."
148814,L120811,u4331,m289,ACE,Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
148815,L120240,u4331,m289,ACE,No. Just stop everything.
148816,L120239,u4368,m289,STAGE MANAGER,It's always been our policy -
148817,L120238,u4331,m289,ACE,"That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris."
148818,L120237,u4368,m289,STAGE MANAGER,"But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired."
148819,L120236,u4331,m289,ACE,...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
148820,L120235,u4368,m289,STAGE MANAGER,...and she doesn't always -
148821,L120234,u4331,m289,ACE,She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
148822,L120233,u4368,m289,STAGE MANAGER,"Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows..."
148823,L120232,u4331,m289,ACE,'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
148824,L120231,u4368,m289,STAGE MANAGER,...position...
148825,L120230,u4331,m289,ACE,I...
148826,L120229,u4368,m289,STAGE MANAGER,...trying to offer you the respect that your...
148827,L120228,u4331,m289,ACE,Why is she eight pounds over?
148828,L120227,u4368,m289,STAGE MANAGER,"Well, sir, I was just..."
148829,L120226,u4331,m289,ACE,Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
148830,L120225,u4368,m289,STAGE MANAGER,"Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension."
148831,L121725,u4331,m289,ACE,Okay.
148832,L121724,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,I-I'll do it.
148833,L121723,u4331,m289,ACE,Right away. Okay?
148834,L121722,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,Okay. Just take it easy.
148835,L121721,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away."
148836,L121720,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,Who's this?
148837,L121719,u4331,m289,ACE,"Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on."
148838,L121201,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,"He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted."
148839,L121200,u4331,m289,ACE,"No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down."
148840,L121199,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
148841,L121198,u4331,m289,ACE,"Oh, no."
148842,L121197,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,"Now, he's really pissed."
148843,L121194,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,"The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we..."
148844,L121193,u4331,m289,ACE,What is it?
148845,L121192,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,"Sam, we got a problem."
148846,L121184,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,Here we go. Good luck.
148847,L121183,u4331,m289,ACE,L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
148848,L121182,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,To Abraham Lincoln.
148849,L120242,u4331,m289,ACE,"I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy."
148850,L120241,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,This woman's an institution.
148851,L120174,u4331,m289,ACE,Call security.
148852,L120173,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
148853,L119702,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
148854,L119701,u4331,m289,ACE,Why not make them happy?
148855,L119700,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,Certainly.  Senator.
148856,L119699,u4331,m289,ACE,"Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants."
148857,L119698,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,"Nice to see you, Senator."
148858,L119697,u4331,m289,ACE,I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
148859,L119689,u4331,m289,ACE,I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
148860,L119688,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
148861,L119687,u4331,m289,ACE,We can't get rid of him?
148862,L119686,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,We need this guy.
148863,L119523,u4331,m289,ACE,"For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit..."
148864,L119522,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,"...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room..."
148865,L119521,u4331,m289,ACE,"I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work."
148866,L121894,u4331,m289,ACE,They had all the pieces they needed.
148867,L121893,u4349,m289,GINGER,But it was just mine.
148868,L121892,u4331,m289,ACE,"After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway."
148869,L121816,u4331,m289,ACE,If she calms down...
148870,L121815,u4349,m289,GINGER,I am calm!
148871,L121814,u4331,m289,ACE,"If she calms down, I will let her in the house."

148875,L121806,u4331,m289,ACE,I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.

148877,L121804,u4331,m289,ACE,I'm afraid to let her in the house.

148880,L121799,u4349,m289,GINGER,Not gonna let me in?
148881,L121798,u4331,m289,ACE,"I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -"
148882,L121779,u4331,m289,ACE,I'm not -
148883,L121778,u4349,m289,GINGER,You are not threatening me anymore!
148884,L121777,u4349,m289,GINGER,Don't you threaten me!

148887,L121774,u4331,m289,ACE,You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
148888,L121773,u4349,m289,GINGER,I am not!
148889,L121772,u4331,m289,ACE,"Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -"

148898,L121715,u4331,m289,ACE,Now you need approval from him to go home?
148899,L121713,u4331,m289,ACE,Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.

You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?"
149253,L120041,u4374,m289,WINNER,I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
149254,L120040,u4331,m289,ACE,And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
149255,L120039,u4374,m289,WINNER,I just wanna get out of here.

I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?"

149276,L121283,u4333,m289,AMY,I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
149277,L121282,u4356,m289,LESTER,"Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-"

149279,L120730,u4361,m289,PISCANO,"Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?"
149280,L120729,u4336,m289,BORELLI,"Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?"
149281,L120728,u4361,m289,PISCANO,"Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records."
149282,L120727,u4336,m289,BORELLI,You gotta go back out there.
149283,L120726,u4361,m289,PISCANO,"Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?"
149284,L120725,u4336,m289,BORELLI,What expenses?
149285,L120724,u4361,m289,PISCANO,"Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip."
149286,L120723,u4336,m289,BORELLI,You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
149287,L120718,u4361,m289,PISCANO,What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
149288,L120717,u4336,m289,BORELLI,Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
149289,L120716,u4361,m289,PISCANO,I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
149290,L120825,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso."
149291,L120824,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,Sam?
149292,L120823,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep."
149293,L120822,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,You can't talk to me like...
149294,L120821,u4359,m289,NICKY,"You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it."
149295,L120820,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
149296,L120819,u4359,m289,NICKY,Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
149297,L120818,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,"Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss."
149298,L120817,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though."
149299,L120816,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,"Well, I've been busy."
149300,L120815,u4359,m289,NICKY,I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
149301,L120814,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,Hi. Good.
149302,L120813,u4359,m289,NICKY,"No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?"
149303,L120397,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash."
149304,L120396,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,Yes.
149305,L120395,u4359,m289,NICKY,"I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?"
149306,L120394,u4359,m289,NICKY,So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
149307,L120393,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere."
149308,L120392,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,"You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss."
149309,L120391,u4359,m289,NICKY,"But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?"
149310,L120390,u4337,m289,CHARLIE CLARK,"Yeah, that works out."

149405,L119949,u4343,m289,EDDY,"Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?"
149406,L121945,u4344,m289,FBI AGENT #10,We can't help him if -
149407,L121944,u4363,m289,PISCANO'S WIFE,Artie! Artie!
149408,L121943,u4344,m289,FBI AGENT #10,Stay out of the way!
149409,L121942,u4363,m289,PISCANO'S WIFE,"No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!"
149410,L121941,u4344,m289,FBI AGENT #10,Calm down! Calm down!
149411,L121940,u4363,m289,PISCANO'S WIFE,Artie!
149412,L121891,u4349,m289,GINGER,But I'm just trying to leave.
149413,L121890,u4345,m289,FBI AGENT #2,We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
149414,L121889,u4349,m289,GINGER,What?
149415,L121888,u4345,m289,FBI AGENT #2,We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
149416,L121887,u4349,m289,GINGER,For what?
149417,L121886,u4345,m289,FBI AGENT #2,We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
149418,L121567,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy."
149419,L121566,u4358,m289,MARINO,I understand.
149420,L121565,u4348,m289,GAGGI,You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
149421,L121564,u4358,m289,MARINO,No problem.
149422,L121563,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me."
149423,L121562,u4358,m289,MARINO,He's good. He's fine.
149424,L121561,u4348,m289,GAGGI,I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
149425,L121560,u4358,m289,MARINO,Hm.
149426,L121559,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky."
149427,L121558,u4358,m289,MARINO,"I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?"
149428,L121557,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Are you sure?
149429,L121556,u4358,m289,MARINO,No. I ain't see anything like that.
149430,L121555,u4358,m289,MARINO,"So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too."
149431,L121554,u4358,m289,MARINO,Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
149432,L121553,u4358,m289,MARINO,"What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed."
149433,L121552,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem."
149434,L121551,u4358,m289,MARINO,"I always tell you the truth, Remo."
149435,L121550,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"I want you to tell me the truth, mind you."
149436,L121549,u4358,m289,MARINO,"Of course, Remo."
149437,L121548,u4348,m289,GAGGI,It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
149438,L121547,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"Frankie, I want to ask you something."
149439,L120914,u4358,m289,MARINO,"I'll tell him, Remo."
149440,L120913,u4348,m289,GAGGI,You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
149441,L120912,u4358,m289,MARINO,I know.
149442,L120911,u4348,m289,GAGGI,And I mean... that's no good.
149443,L120910,u4358,m289,MARINO,What're you gonna do?
149444,L120909,u4348,m289,GAGGI,It's in all the papers.
149445,L120908,u4358,m289,MARINO,I know.
149446,L120907,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
149447,L120906,u4358,m289,MARINO,"Yeah, I heard, yeah."
149448,L120905,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
149449,L120488,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']"
149450,L120487,u4358,m289,MARINO,"I'll take care of it, Remo."
149451,L120486,u4348,m289,GAGGI,...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
149452,L120475,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"Fine, fine."
149453,L120474,u4358,m289,MARINO,How are you?
149454,L120473,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"Hey, Frankie."
149455,L120480,u4348,m289,GAGGI,And how are things going down there?
149456,L120479,u4359,m289,NICKY,"But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out..."
149457,L120478,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Uh-huh. Good.
149458,L119645,u4359,m289,NICKY,Want me to take this for you?
149459,L119644,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Fine.
149460,L119643,u4359,m289,NICKY,Yeah.
149461,L119642,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
149462,L119641,u4359,m289,NICKY,All right.
149463,L119640,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?"
149464,L119639,u4359,m289,NICKY,Mm.
149465,L119638,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him."
149466,L119637,u4359,m289,NICKY,Mm.
149467,L119636,u4348,m289,GAGGI,T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy?
149468,L119635,u4359,m289,NICKY,I'll be right out.
149469,L119634,u4348,m289,GAGGI,"Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']"
149470,L119624,u4359,m289,NICKY,Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
149471,L119623,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Ace.
149472,L119616,u4348,m289,GAGGI,That's enough now!
149473,L119615,u4359,m289,NICKY,"I mean, unless Ace made his bet."
149474,L119614,u4348,m289,GAGGI,Ma che cazzo!
149475,L119613,u4359,m289,NICKY,"But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost."
149476,L119558,u4359,m289,NICKY,Definitely the most important guy in this room.
149477,L119557,u4348,m289,GAGGI,You got a round figure on it?
149478,L121755,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Okay, yeah."
149479,L121754,u4349,m289,GINGER,You fucked with me for the last time!
149480,L121753,u4359,m289,NICKY,All right. Be careful.
149481,L121752,u4349,m289,GINGER,I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
149482,L121751,u4359,m289,NICKY,"All right, all right."
149483,L121750,u4349,m289,GINGER,I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
149484,L121749,u4359,m289,NICKY,Get the fuck out of here.
149485,L121742,u4359,m289,NICKY,Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
149486,L121741,u4349,m289,GINGER,"Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!"
149487,L121739,u4359,m289,NICKY,"How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-"
149488,L121738,u4349,m289,GINGER,What about my money?
149489,L121737,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it."
149490,L121736,u4349,m289,GINGER,"Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with."
149491,L121735,u4359,m289,NICKY,"I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-"
149492,L121734,u4349,m289,GINGER,"If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?"
149493,L121733,u4359,m289,NICKY,"I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death."
149494,L121732,u4349,m289,GINGER,"Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no."
149495,L121731,u4359,m289,NICKY,What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
149496,L121498,u4349,m289,GINGER,Yeah. Uh-huh -
149497,L121497,u4359,m289,NICKY,It's what you want?
149498,L121496,u4349,m289,GINGER,"Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
149499,L121495,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?"
149500,L121494,u4349,m289,GINGER,"Nicky, please..."
149501,L121493,u4359,m289,NICKY,Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
149502,L121492,u4349,m289,GINGER,Yeah.
149503,L121491,u4359,m289,NICKY,A sponsor.
149504,L121490,u4349,m289,GINGER,Yeah.
149505,L121489,u4359,m289,NICKY,Is that what you want?
149506,L121488,u4349,m289,GINGER,I do. I need a new sponsor.
149507,L121487,u4349,m289,GINGER,"I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky."
149508,L121486,u4359,m289,NICKY,Come on. Don't be scared.
149509,L121485,u4349,m289,GINGER,I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
149510,L121484,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Yes, you are."
149511,L121483,u4349,m289,GINGER,I'm not as tough as you think I am.
149512,L121482,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry."
149513,L121481,u4349,m289,GINGER,He hates my fuckin' guts.
149514,L121480,u4349,m289,GINGER,Exactly.  He hates me.
149515,L121479,u4359,m289,NICKY,"He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that."
149516,L121478,u4349,m289,GINGER,"No, he's not."
149517,L121475,u4359,m289,NICKY,Everything went to his head.
149518,L121474,u4349,m289,GINGER,Sure did.
149519,L121473,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?"
149520,L121472,u4349,m289,GINGER,'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
149521,L121471,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Yes, you did."
149522,L121470,u4349,m289,GINGER,I did what you told me to.
149523,L121469,u4359,m289,NICKY,You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
149524,L121468,u4349,m289,GINGER,Exactly.
149525,L121467,u4359,m289,NICKY,You did. You're right.
149526,L121466,u4349,m289,GINGER,"I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back."
149527,L121465,u4359,m289,NICKY,"No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off."
149528,L121464,u4349,m289,GINGER,He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
149529,L121463,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too."
149530,L121462,u4349,m289,GINGER,"He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass."
149531,L121461,u4359,m289,NICKY,Hm.
149532,L121460,u4349,m289,GINGER,"Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry."
149533,L121459,u4359,m289,NICKY,You know?
149534,L121458,u4349,m289,GINGER,Mm-hm.
149535,L121457,u4359,m289,NICKY,See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
149536,L121456,u4349,m289,GINGER,Okay.
149537,L121455,u4359,m289,NICKY,Let me think about that.
149538,L121454,u4349,m289,GINGER,"Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out."
149539,L121453,u4359,m289,NICKY,Yeah.
149540,L121452,u4349,m289,GINGER,Yeah?
149541,L121451,u4359,m289,NICKY,Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
149542,L121450,u4349,m289,GINGER,I don't -
149543,L121449,u4359,m289,NICKY,What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
149544,L121448,u4349,m289,GINGER,Nothin'.
149545,L121447,u4359,m289,NICKY,What? What?
149546,L121446,u4349,m289,GINGER,"Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -"
149547,L121445,u4359,m289,NICKY,"I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -"
149548,L121317,u4349,m289,GINGER,Bye.
149549,L121316,u4359,m289,NICKY,"And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay."
149550,L121315,u4359,m289,NICKY,I'll be there.
149551,L121314,u4349,m289,GINGER,"So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?"
149552,L121313,u4349,m289,GINGER,"Yeah, uh-huh... Okay."
149553,L121312,u4359,m289,NICKY,"You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do."
149554,L121311,u4349,m289,GINGER,"No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me."
149555,L121310,u4359,m289,NICKY,"You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?"
149556,L120642,u4359,m289,NICKY,It's all right.
149557,L120641,u4349,m289,GINGER,Thank you.
149558,L120640,u4359,m289,NICKY,Yeah.
149559,L120639,u4349,m289,GINGER,Thanks.
149560,L120638,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy."
149561,L120637,u4349,m289,GINGER,You're so nice.
149562,L120636,u4359,m289,NICKY,You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
149563,L120635,u4349,m289,GINGER,"Oh, come on."
149564,L120634,u4359,m289,NICKY,"And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse."
149565,L120632,u4349,m289,GINGER,Yeah.  Thanks.
149566,L120631,u4359,m289,NICKY,All right?
149567,L120630,u4349,m289,GINGER,Okay.
149568,L120629,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him."
149569,L120628,u4349,m289,GINGER,He gives a fuck what I do?
149570,L120627,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried."
149571,L120626,u4349,m289,GINGER,He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
149572,L120625,u4349,m289,GINGER,He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
149573,L120624,u4359,m289,NICKY,"I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens."
149574,L120623,u4349,m289,GINGER,I do.
149575,L120622,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace."
149576,L120621,u4359,m289,NICKY,I know what you mean.

149759,L121612,u4358,m289,MARINO,"I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up."
149760,L121611,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Yeah, what'd you tell him?"
149761,L121610,u4358,m289,MARINO,He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
149762,L121609,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?"
149763,L121608,u4358,m289,MARINO,He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
149764,L121572,u4359,m289,NICKY,Go fuck yourself.
149765,L121571,u4358,m289,MARINO,You must have drunk too much.
149766,L121229,u4359,m289,NICKY,What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'.
149767,L121228,u4358,m289,MARINO,Let's get out of here.

149773,L121188,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?"
149774,L121187,u4358,m289,MARINO,Mm.
149775,L120922,u4359,m289,NICKY,"They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready."
149776,L120921,u4358,m289,MARINO,It's up to you.
149777,L120920,u4359,m289,NICKY,"I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him."
149778,L120919,u4359,m289,NICKY,Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
149779,L120918,u4358,m289,MARINO,"Yeah, but they're complaining."
149780,L120917,u4359,m289,NICKY,"But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back."
149781,L120916,u4359,m289,NICKY,"...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop."
149782,L120496,u4359,m289,NICKY,But he never talked.
149783,L120495,u4358,m289,MARINO,"Yeah, thanks a lot."
149784,L120482,u4359,m289,NICKY,...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
149785,L120481,u4358,m289,MARINO,Fine. Everything's goin' good.
149786,L120477,u4358,m289,MARINO,Nicky sends his warmest regards.
149787,L120476,u4359,m289,NICKY,"I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together."
149788,L120472,u4358,m289,MARINO,Remo.
149789,L120471,u4359,m289,NICKY,...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
149790,L120431,u4359,m289,NICKY,Pleasure.

149794,L120425,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Hey, Shelly."

149799,L120386,u4359,m289,NICKY,Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
149800,L120381,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Every night, on the couch."
149801,L120380,u4358,m289,MARINO,She asleep?
149802,L120379,u4359,m289,NICKY,I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
149803,L120374,u4358,m289,MARINO,"What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?"
149804,L120373,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs."
149805,L120333,u4358,m289,MARINO,This peter's a motherfucker.
149806,L120332,u4359,m289,NICKY,What's takin' so long over there?
149807,L120331,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around."
149808,L120210,u4359,m289,NICKY,You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
149809,L120209,u4358,m289,MARINO,Get up.

149834,L119923,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!"
149835,L119922,u4370,m289,TONY,"I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it."
149836,L119921,u4359,m289,NICKY,"Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!"

149855,L121002,u4362,m289,PISCANO'S MOTHER,Then do it the way you want.
149856,L121001,u4361,m289,PISCANO,"...done right, you gotta do it yourself."

149859,L120985,u4361,m289,PISCANO,"You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this."
149860,L120984,u4362,m289,PISCANO'S MOTHER,You'll get a heart attack like that.
149861,L120983,u4361,m289,PISCANO,"All right, all right. But I - I -"
149862,L120982,u4362,m289,PISCANO'S MOTHER,"Take it easy, though."

149890,L120025,u4366,m289,SHERBERT,Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
149891,L123456,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Adonis, be polite. She's a friend."
149892,L123455,u4375,m290,ADONIS,Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
149893,L123454,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
149894,L123168,u4375,m290,ADONIS,"I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this."
149895,L123167,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Works for me.
149896,L123155,u4375,m290,ADONIS,"Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat..."
149897,L123154,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Have we reached the epi-center?
149898,L123013,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,It's okay. Let her go.
149899,L123012,u4375,m290,ADONIS,"Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned..."
149900,L122943,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,You have to dial nine first.
149901,L122942,u4375,m290,ADONIS,I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
149902,L122941,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission..."
149903,L122937,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
149904,L122936,u4375,m290,ADONIS,The crowd bought it.
149905,L122859,u4375,m290,ADONIS,"Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you.."
149906,L122858,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock..."
149907,L123460,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now.."
149908,L123459,u4375,m290,ADONIS,"You know, nobody likes you..."
149909,L123444,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not."
149910,L123443,u4375,m290,ADONIS,
149911,L123195,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen."
149912,L123194,u4375,m290,ADONIS,"Ah, Cats. Now and Forever."
149913,L122986,u4377,m290,CACTUS,This looks promising...
149914,L122985,u4375,m290,ADONIS,I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
149915,L122954,u4377,m290,CACTUS,Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
149916,L122953,u4375,m290,ADONIS,"Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that..."
149917,L123525,u4376,m290,BROCK,I lied.
149918,L123524,u4386,m290,SELINA,I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
149919,L123520,u4376,m290,BROCK,We'll hunt him down together...
149920,L123519,u4386,m290,SELINA,"In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain..."
149921,L123518,u4376,m290,BROCK,You're serious?  You'd help me...
149922,L123517,u4386,m290,SELINA,"It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy..."
149923,L123516,u4376,m290,BROCK,This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
149924,L123515,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster.."
149925,L123514,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?"
149926,L123511,u4386,m290,SELINA,"A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff."
149927,L123510,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff."
149928,L123428,u4376,m290,BROCK,I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
149929,L123427,u4386,m290,SELINA,"No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--"
149930,L123411,u4376,m290,BROCK,You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
149931,L123410,u4386,m290,SELINA,Hmm. Not bad.
149932,L123407,u4376,m290,BROCK,"What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down..."
149933,L123406,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God."
149934,L123293,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Uh Brock, today you are without me..."
149935,L123292,u4376,m290,BROCK,Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
149936,L123291,u4386,m290,SELINA,At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
149937,L123290,u4376,m290,BROCK,Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
149938,L123289,u4386,m290,SELINA,"I got home fine. How's the ""warehouse."""
149939,L123288,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was ""no extension in the Hut."" Whatever that means.."
149940,L123145,u4386,m290,SELINA,I'm sure.
149941,L123144,u4376,m290,BROCK,Are you sure?
149942,L123143,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your ""warehouse."" I'll be okay..."
149943,L123142,u4376,m290,BROCK,This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
149944,L123141,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry."
149945,L123140,u4376,m290,BROCK,What's the matter?  What are you saying?
149946,L123139,u4386,m290,SELINA,A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
149947,L123138,u4386,m290,SELINA,No it's not.
149948,L123137,u4376,m290,BROCK,"What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman."
149949,L123136,u4386,m290,SELINA,"I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?"
149950,L123135,u4376,m290,BROCK,"So, did you see ""Seinfeld"" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh."
149951,L123134,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Stop. We are not having a ""duality"" conversation. ""Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side."" Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying ""I have an inner strength"" or ""Deep down, I'm really ambitious."" ""One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night."" If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a ""duality"" conversation."
149952,L123133,u4376,m290,BROCK,"I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women..."
149953,L123132,u4376,m290,BROCK,"You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one.."
149954,L123131,u4386,m290,SELINA,"I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?"
149955,L123130,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?"
149956,L123129,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing..."
149957,L123128,u4376,m290,BROCK,What did you think?
149958,L123127,u4386,m290,SELINA,You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
149959,L123058,u4386,m290,SELINA,I'm not afraid. Are you?
149960,L123057,u4376,m290,BROCK,"There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if.."
149961,L123056,u4386,m290,SELINA,But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
149962,L123055,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan."
149963,L123054,u4386,m290,SELINA,How heroic of you...
149964,L123053,u4376,m290,BROCK,"I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?"
149965,L123052,u4386,m290,SELINA,You're probably right.
149966,L123051,u4376,m290,BROCK,"I'll bet the butler's name wasn't ""Jeff."""
149967,L123050,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out.."
149968,L123049,u4376,m290,BROCK,What's the matter...
149969,L123046,u4386,m290,SELINA,I wonder..
149970,L123045,u4376,m290,BROCK,Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
149971,L122922,u4386,m290,SELINA,I don't know. I can't remember.
149972,L122921,u4376,m290,BROCK,Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
149973,L122920,u4386,m290,SELINA,Guilty. I am.
149974,L122919,u4376,m290,BROCK,You say that like an amnesia victim.
149975,L122918,u4386,m290,SELINA,"I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me."
149976,L122917,u4376,m290,BROCK,"No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story.."
149977,L122916,u4386,m290,SELINA,In women?
149978,L122915,u4376,m290,BROCK,He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
149979,L123485,u4383,m290,LANE,What little boy doesn't?
149980,L123484,u4376,m290,BROCK,"I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?"
149981,L123483,u4383,m290,LANE,"But then we knew that all along, didn't we..."
149982,L123482,u4376,m290,BROCK,I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
149983,L123481,u4383,m290,LANE,I've been looking for you.
149984,L123430,u4376,m290,BROCK,It may be time to get the police involved...
149985,L123429,u4383,m290,LANE,"I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you..."
149986,L123426,u4383,m290,LANE,Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
149987,L123425,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?"
149988,L123424,u4383,m290,LANE,We're waiting.
149989,L123420,u4383,m290,LANE,"Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to.."
149990,L123419,u4376,m290,BROCK,"You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart."
149991,L123415,u4383,m290,LANE,But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
149992,L123414,u4376,m290,BROCK,You're kidding.
149993,L123405,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?"
149994,L123404,u4383,m290,LANE,"Selina, are you okay?"
149995,L123365,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going..."
149996,L123364,u4383,m290,LANE,I better go report this in...
149997,L123363,u4383,m290,LANE,I suppose she does.
149998,L123362,u4376,m290,BROCK,She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
149999,L123361,u4383,m290,LANE,"A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?"
150000,L123360,u4376,m290,BROCK,She has a real spirit.
150001,L123359,u4383,m290,LANE,Selina Kyle...lovely person.
150002,L123358,u4376,m290,BROCK,They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
150003,L123357,u4383,m290,LANE,"Women, huh?"
150004,L123296,u4383,m290,LANE,"Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect?  I just love risking electrocution every time I.."
150005,L123295,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Oh, how long have you had your own route?"
150006,L123294,u4383,m290,LANE,"There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times."
150007,L123588,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?"
150008,L123587,u4377,m290,CACTUS,Catwomen. Lots of them!
150009,L123586,u4376,m290,BROCK,Wha-at?
150010,L123585,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"God, can you hear me!"
150011,L123537,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!"
150012,L123536,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight.."
150013,L123535,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for.."
150014,L123531,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?"
150015,L123530,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!"
150016,L123529,u4376,m290,BROCK,You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
150017,L123606,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"What about ""climbing in?"""
150018,L123605,u4376,m290,BROCK,"The ""skylight?"" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight..."
150019,L123604,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,Even the skylight?
150020,L123603,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged."
150021,L123602,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?"
150022,L123601,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real."
150023,L123600,u4376,m290,BROCK,"Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain."
150024,L123599,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set.."
150025,L123598,u4376,m290,BROCK,"You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a.."
150026,L123597,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,Pass!
150027,L123596,u4376,m290,BROCK,"I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that..."
150028,L123595,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet."
150029,L123594,u4376,m290,BROCK,My dog!
150030,L123593,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog.."
150031,L123592,u4376,m290,BROCK,What do you want from me?
150032,L123591,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,Winning.
150033,L123590,u4376,m290,BROCK,"I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?"
150034,L123171,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter..."
150035,L123170,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo."
150036,L123169,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Yeah, this is better than rape."
150037,L123106,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win."
150038,L123105,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up."
150039,L122991,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham..."
150040,L122990,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,What's the catch?
150041,L122961,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,He didn't remember to roll up his window...
150042,L122960,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"""Dat's gotta hurt!"""
150043,L122939,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?"
150044,L122938,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
150045,L123494,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
150046,L123493,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the ""Wild"" side.."
150047,L123464,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Absolutely.
150048,L123463,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Car wash, Captain?"
150049,L123451,u4377,m290,CACTUS,I got her...
150050,L123450,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat.."
150051,L123373,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do."
150052,L123372,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you..."
150053,L123102,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate..."
150054,L123101,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally..."
150055,L123100,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,What did you say?
150056,L123099,u4377,m290,CACTUS,God-damn..
150057,L122995,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
150058,L122994,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him."
150059,L122973,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Why am I still troubled...
150060,L122972,u4377,m290,CACTUS,Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
150061,L122935,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
150062,L122934,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: ""I am the Law and I am the Danish..."""
150063,L122865,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Well. I stand corrected.
150064,L122864,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs."
150065,L122863,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
150066,L122849,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"""Well done,"" Cactus."
150067,L122848,u4377,m290,CACTUS,"What a ""drag."""
150068,L123371,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,I know.
150069,L123370,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,I loved you.
150070,L123369,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  ""Superhero"" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse..."
150071,L123368,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior."
150072,L123367,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
150073,L123366,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't."
150074,L123199,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!"
150075,L123198,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
150076,L123197,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
150077,L123016,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning."
150078,L123015,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"You like them, don't you, Boss."
150079,L122971,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
150080,L122970,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?"
150081,L122958,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?"
150082,L122957,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it."
150083,L122853,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Now he'll be up all night...

150085,L123492,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,You can't get away with..
150086,L123491,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night."
150087,L123462,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical ""missions""...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won."
150088,L123461,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
150089,L123458,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to ""get to the bottom"" of things. Trying to ""save the city."" It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore."
150090,L123457,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
150091,L123228,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,You've seen me...
150092,L123227,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,You think so?...Selina?
150093,L123226,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,I still have one left...
150094,L123225,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
150095,L123224,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?"
150096,L123223,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs."
150097,L123222,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"""A superhero's job is to protect.."" Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?"
150098,L123221,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,"A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke."
150099,L123220,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say ""I'm wearing no underwear""--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?"
150100,L123219,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
150101,L123011,u4378,m290,CAPTAIN GOD,And...your point?
150102,L123010,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me.."
150103,L123385,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina."
150104,L123384,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel."
150105,L123383,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"""Save the City?"" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but.."
150106,L123382,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
150107,L123381,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some ""clues"" on this disc. I can't..."
150108,L123380,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
150109,L123379,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh..."
150110,L123378,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,For when the time comes..
150111,L123377,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"Men, huh?"
150112,L123376,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you..."
150113,L123320,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you.."
150114,L123319,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring.."
150115,L123248,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,Whatever you say...Sis.
150116,L123247,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace."
150117,L123246,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,"Hello, Spooky."
150118,L123007,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,Spear.
150119,L123006,u4379,m290,CATWOMAN,Spooky.

150121,L123349,u4382,m290,HOUSECAT,What's the name of your child's best friend?
150122,L123348,u4380,m290,FEMALE EXEC CAT,How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
150123,L123347,u4382,m290,HOUSECAT,"You mean, ""Consuela"" is a good mother.."
150124,L123346,u4380,m290,FEMALE EXEC CAT,I'm a good mother!
150125,L123323,u4380,m290,FEMALE EXEC CAT,"Did you just say ""girls?"""
150126,L123322,u4382,m290,HOUSECAT,You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
150127,L123321,u4380,m290,FEMALE EXEC CAT,You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
150128,L123044,u4381,m290,FRANK,"Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here.."
150129,L123043,u4386,m290,SELINA,"What if I were to say ""Your Wife""-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?"
150130,L123042,u4381,m290,FRANK,"What if I were to say ""You're Fired?"""
150131,L123041,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it."
150132,L123040,u4381,m290,FRANK,"Hey, you're anti-male."
150133,L123039,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it."
150134,L123038,u4381,m290,FRANK,"Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's ""sexual harassment..."""
150135,L123037,u4386,m290,SELINA,Stop.
150136,L123036,u4381,m290,FRANK,"There you are, Selina. I've been thinking..I have some..""positions"" opening up.."
150137,L122903,u4381,m290,FRANK,"Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's ""sexual harassment"" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman..."

150139,L122901,u4381,m290,FRANK,"You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe..."
150140,L122891,u4386,m290,SELINA,What's the good news?
150141,L122890,u4381,m290,FRANK,You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
150142,L123433,u4386,m290,SELINA,I'll let you know.
150143,L123432,u4383,m290,LANE,"We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?"
150144,L123431,u4386,m290,SELINA,Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
150145,L123423,u4383,m290,LANE,"Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life."
150146,L123422,u4386,m290,SELINA,"You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend..."
150147,L123418,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Then there's you, Louis, sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny, smart, attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose, depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman."
150148,L123417,u4383,m290,LANE,Not too cool...
150149,L123416,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's ""You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean ""warehouse."""
150150,L123413,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  ""My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."""
150151,L123412,u4383,m290,LANE,Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
150152,L123409,u4386,m290,SELINA,"I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman."
150153,L123408,u4383,m290,LANE,"Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?"
150154,L123276,u4383,m290,LANE,Uh-huh..

150157,L123273,u4386,m290,SELINA,I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
150158,L123272,u4383,m290,LANE,"You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more."
150159,L123271,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, ""A superhero's job is to protect..."""
150160,L123270,u4383,m290,LANE,"I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a ""Month of the Woman"" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could..."
150161,L123269,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Hey, I thought..."
150162,L123268,u4383,m290,LANE,"I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with ""Brock Leviathan, architect.""  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine..."
150163,L123267,u4386,m290,SELINA,"I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded..."
150164,L123266,u4383,m290,LANE,I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
150165,L123265,u4386,m290,SELINA,Like you don't know...
150166,L123264,u4383,m290,LANE,"About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?"
150167,L123263,u4386,m290,SELINA,Nothing. How's your hand?
150168,L123262,u4383,m290,LANE,What?
150169,L123261,u4386,m290,SELINA,Did you try to kill...
150170,L123260,u4383,m290,LANE,"Actually, yes."
150171,L123259,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?"
150172,L123258,u4383,m290,LANE,"Yes, you shouted the words ""Captain God"" at me for no reason..."
150173,L123257,u4386,m290,SELINA,You turned around!
150174,L123256,u4383,m290,LANE,What did--?
150175,L123255,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Hey, Captain God!"
150176,L123254,u4383,m290,LANE,"I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?"
150177,L123253,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Next time, call..."
150178,L123252,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess..."
150179,L123251,u4383,m290,LANE,"No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of.."
150180,L123250,u4386,m290,SELINA,Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
150181,L123249,u4383,m290,LANE,Good morning.
150182,L123086,u4383,m290,LANE,"Ah!  Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects.."
150183,L123085,u4386,m290,SELINA,I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
150184,L123084,u4383,m290,LANE,"I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight..."
150185,L123083,u4386,m290,SELINA,But of course you are.
150186,L123082,u4383,m290,LANE,"Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane."
150187,L123081,u4383,m290,LANE,Oh now this one is mine...
150188,L123080,u4386,m290,SELINA,Enough.
150189,L123079,u4383,m290,LANE,How much?
150190,L123078,u4386,m290,SELINA,I actually got some memory back last night.
150191,L123077,u4383,m290,LANE,"Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging.."
150192,L123076,u4383,m290,LANE,"Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad.."
150193,L123075,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Yeah, she's okay."
150194,L123074,u4383,m290,LANE,"What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot."
150195,L123073,u4386,m290,SELINA,I don't know what came over me.
150196,L122925,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Uh. ""Thanks?"""
150197,L122924,u4383,m290,LANE,"A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in ""Frank's Fun Palace"" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter.."

150200,L123396,u4386,m290,SELINA,"What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?"
150201,L123395,u4384,m290,LIBRARY CLERK,"It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?"
150202,L123394,u4386,m290,SELINA,But I'm blind.
150203,L123393,u4384,m290,LIBRARY CLERK,"I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library..."

150206,L123554,u4385,m290,MOM,Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
150207,L123553,u4386,m290,SELINA,But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
150208,L123552,u4385,m290,MOM,"Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people..."
150209,L123551,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do.."
150210,L123550,u4385,m290,MOM,I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
150211,L123549,u4386,m290,SELINA,They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
150212,L123543,u4385,m290,MOM,"Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening."
150213,L123542,u4386,m290,SELINA,I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
150214,L123541,u4385,m290,MOM,"What kind of name is ""Brock Leviathan?"""
150215,L123540,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up..."
150216,L123026,u4386,m290,SELINA,"It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya."
150217,L123025,u4385,m290,MOM,Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
150218,L122887,u4385,m290,MOM,"Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that ""Hag"" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor."
150219,L122886,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you..."
150220,L122885,u4385,m290,MOM,Don't sneak up on me...
150221,L122883,u4385,m290,MOM,"Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late."
150222,L122882,u4386,m290,SELINA,"I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag..."
150223,L122879,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take.."
150224,L122878,u4385,m290,MOM,"It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. ""Absolutely nothing""-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?"
150225,L122877,u4386,m290,SELINA,Maybe.
150226,L122876,u4385,m290,MOM,"Is every single thing out of your mouth since your ""accident"" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?"
150227,L122875,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me."
150228,L122874,u4385,m290,MOM,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you."
150229,L122873,u4386,m290,SELINA,A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
150230,L122872,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Yes, Mother. Dear."
150231,L122871,u4385,m290,MOM,You're late.
150232,L123314,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,Thanks.
150233,L123313,u4386,m290,SELINA,Nice breasts.
150234,L123311,u4386,m290,SELINA,You going to talk all day?
150235,L123310,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane..."
150236,L123304,u4386,m290,SELINA,"The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?"
150237,L123303,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush."
150238,L123302,u4386,m290,SELINA,"You seem sad, Spooky."
150239,L123301,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
150240,L123300,u4386,m290,SELINA,What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
150241,L123299,u4386,m290,SELINA,"Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be.."
150242,L123298,u4387,m290,SPOOKY,"I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance..."
150243,L123297,u4386,m290,SELINA,What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
150244,L123728,u4398,m291,THEO,I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
150245,L123727,u4388,m291,2ND DRIVER,I don't see anybody in there but you.
150246,L123726,u4398,m291,THEO,I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
150247,L123725,u4388,m291,2ND DRIVER,This is one way.
150248,L123724,u4398,m291,THEO,Any place.
150249,L123723,u4388,m291,2ND DRIVER,Where do you think you're going?
150250,L123722,u4398,m291,THEO,Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
150251,L124415,u4393,m291,LENORE,"I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie."
150252,L124414,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
150253,L124413,u4393,m291,LENORE,I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
150254,L124412,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
150255,L124411,u4393,m291,LENORE,Taking messages.
150256,L124410,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,What are you doing on Theo's line?
150257,L123784,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
150258,L123783,u4393,m291,LENORE,Don't you have children?
150259,L123782,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
150260,L123762,u4393,m291,LENORE,Do I hear a woman's voice?
150261,L123761,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,Was someone in an accident?
150262,L123821,u4392,m291,KLINGER,"Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing."
150263,L123820,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
150264,L123819,u4392,m291,KLINGER,Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
150265,L123818,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,What if they do question the authenticity?
150266,L123787,u4392,m291,KLINGER,Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
150267,L123786,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
150268,L123785,u4392,m291,KLINGER,Have you got to tell her your life story?
150269,L123757,u4392,m291,KLINGER,That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
150270,L123756,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
150271,L123841,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
150272,L123840,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,You gotta just look the other way.
150273,L123839,u4398,m291,THEO,Then whose is it?
150274,L123838,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
150275,L123835,u4398,m291,THEO,Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
150276,L123834,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,"He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this."
150277,L123808,u4398,m291,THEO,"This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?"
150278,L123807,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,Will you two cut it out?
150279,L123792,u4398,m291,THEO,Did you have to tell her my name?
150280,L123791,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,Theo wants to talk again.
150281,L123790,u4398,m291,THEO,She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
150282,L123789,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
150283,L123788,u4398,m291,THEO,I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
150284,L123755,u4398,m291,THEO,How was I in the wrong?
150285,L123754,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,"He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime ""Wifey"" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches."
150286,L123753,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
150287,L123752,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,"Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching."
150288,L123751,u4398,m291,THEO,Say something ...
150289,L123745,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
150290,L123744,u4398,m291,THEO,I didn't hurt you.
150291,L123743,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
150292,L123742,u4398,m291,THEO,You could've made me lose my call.
150293,L123741,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,What was that for?
150294,L123735,u4398,m291,THEO,I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
150295,L123734,u4389,m291,CAITLIN,Who's on the phone?
150296,L124299,u4396,m291,NELSON,I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
150297,L124298,u4390,m291,COP'S VOICE,We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
150298,L124297,u4396,m291,NELSON,No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
150299,L124296,u4390,m291,COP'S VOICE,It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
150300,L124295,u4396,m291,NELSON,You could've killed us.
150301,L124294,u4390,m291,COP'S VOICE,Are you guys all right?
150302,L124425,u4398,m291,THEO,I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
150303,L124424,u4391,m291,GRILLO,I told you I should've cuffed him.
150304,L124406,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm the one they'd be looking for.
150305,L124405,u4391,m291,GRILLO,Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
150306,L124397,u4398,m291,THEO,Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
150307,L124396,u4391,m291,GRILLO,Can you make him stop!
150308,L124395,u4398,m291,THEO,"Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you."
150309,L124391,u4398,m291,THEO,Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
150310,L124390,u4391,m291,GRILLO,How do we get back to the freeway?
150311,L124380,u4391,m291,GRILLO,Any time you decide to let me in on it.
150312,L124379,u4398,m291,THEO,You missed.
150313,L124368,u4391,m291,GRILLO,Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
150314,L124367,u4398,m291,THEO,Or relieve me of it later.
150315,L124366,u4391,m291,GRILLO,In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
150316,L124351,u4391,m291,GRILLO,Yes sir.
150317,L124350,u4398,m291,THEO,Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
150318,L124343,u4391,m291,GRILLO,You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!
150319,L124342,u4398,m291,THEO,You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
150320,L124341,u4391,m291,GRILLO,"Lady, don't let him do it!"
150321,L124077,u4398,m291,THEO,"See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job."
150322,L124076,u4391,m291,GRILLO,What's this?
150323,L124075,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm going to level with you officer.
150324,L124074,u4391,m291,GRILLO,"Let's have your license, mister."
150325,L124073,u4391,m291,GRILLO,Why would I do that?
150326,L124072,u4398,m291,THEO,What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
150327,L124071,u4391,m291,GRILLO,"They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid."
150328,L124070,u4398,m291,THEO,I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
150329,L124069,u4391,m291,GRILLO,Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
150330,L124388,u4393,m291,LENORE,I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
150331,L124387,u4391,m291,GRILLO,You never miss a trick.
150332,L124386,u4393,m291,LENORE,Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
150333,L124385,u4391,m291,GRILLO,Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
150334,L124383,u4391,m291,GRILLO,"So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!"
150335,L124382,u4393,m291,LENORE,I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
150336,L124364,u4391,m291,GRILLO,You can tell she was really worried about me.
150337,L124363,u4393,m291,LENORE,With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
150338,L124362,u4391,m291,GRILLO,It took you long enough to get my ass out.
150339,L124346,u4393,m291,LENORE,"What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun."
150340,L124345,u4391,m291,GRILLO,"Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught."
150341,L124344,u4393,m291,LENORE,He's seen both of us now.
150342,L123829,u4392,m291,KLINGER,Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
150343,L123828,u4398,m291,THEO,"Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I."
150344,L123827,u4398,m291,THEO,What do you keep making me out to be?
150345,L123826,u4392,m291,KLINGER,"In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody."
150346,L123825,u4398,m291,THEO,"Satisfied, Wiseass?"
150347,L123824,u4392,m291,KLINGER,Got your badge?
150348,L123815,u4398,m291,THEO,It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
150349,L123814,u4392,m291,KLINGER,Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
150350,L123813,u4398,m291,THEO,I improved on the fucking original.
150351,L123812,u4392,m291,KLINGER,"First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>."
150352,L123811,u4398,m291,THEO,Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
150353,L123810,u4392,m291,KLINGER,We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
150354,L123806,u4392,m291,KLINGER,<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
150355,L123805,u4398,m291,THEO,That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
150356,L123804,u4392,m291,KLINGER,"Make a ""U"" and go back."
150357,L123803,u4398,m291,THEO,And stop with the directions.
150358,L123802,u4392,m291,KLINGER,Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
150359,L123801,u4398,m291,THEO,If you know that just back off.
150360,L123800,u4392,m291,KLINGER,Just like they say; no fucking self control.
150361,L123799,u4398,m291,THEO,I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
150362,L123779,u4398,m291,THEO,That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
150363,L123778,u4392,m291,KLINGER,"Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!"
150364,L123771,u4398,m291,THEO,Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
150365,L123770,u4392,m291,KLINGER,What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
150366,L123749,u4398,m291,THEO,"Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again."
150367,L123748,u4392,m291,KLINGER,"That's your ""rep."""
150368,L123747,u4398,m291,THEO,Bullshit.
150369,L123746,u4392,m291,KLINGER,That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
150370,L123739,u4398,m291,THEO,Not this minute.
150371,L123738,u4392,m291,KLINGER,We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
150372,L123737,u4398,m291,THEO,It's taken care of.
150373,L123736,u4392,m291,KLINGER,You switched license plates?
150374,L124504,u4396,m291,NELSON,Give me 20 minutes at least.
150375,L124503,u4393,m291,LENORE,We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
150376,L124502,u4396,m291,NELSON,I was worried about you.  Both of you.
150377,L124501,u4393,m291,LENORE,Any minute.
150378,L124500,u4396,m291,NELSON,I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
150379,L124499,u4393,m291,LENORE,Nels?
150380,L124374,u4396,m291,NELSON,There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
150381,L124373,u4393,m291,LENORE,He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
150382,L124370,u4393,m291,LENORE,Allow me.
150383,L124369,u4396,m291,NELSON,Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
150384,L124281,u4396,m291,NELSON,We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
150385,L124280,u4393,m291,LENORE,Lose the hardware now.
150386,L124273,u4396,m291,NELSON,What am I supposed to do?
150387,L124272,u4393,m291,LENORE,"Nels, don't let that cop pass you."
150388,L124219,u4393,m291,LENORE,I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
150389,L124218,u4396,m291,NELSON,I thought you said you could handle him.
150390,L124525,u4393,m291,LENORE,I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
150391,L124524,u4398,m291,THEO,"Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you."
150392,L124523,u4393,m291,LENORE,My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
150393,L124522,u4398,m291,THEO,I don't want it.
150394,L124521,u4393,m291,LENORE,"I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ..."
150395,L124519,u4393,m291,LENORE,"-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you."
150396,L124518,u4398,m291,THEO,Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
150397,L124517,u4393,m291,LENORE,I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
150398,L124427,u4398,m291,THEO,Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
150399,L124426,u4393,m291,LENORE,Five ... six.
150400,L124422,u4393,m291,LENORE,Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
150401,L124421,u4398,m291,THEO,It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
150402,L124420,u4393,m291,LENORE,You won't live to see it.
150403,L124419,u4398,m291,THEO,Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
150404,L124417,u4393,m291,LENORE,Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
150405,L124416,u4398,m291,THEO,Know what else is in here?
150406,L124404,u4393,m291,LENORE,Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
150407,L124403,u4398,m291,THEO,Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
150408,L124402,u4393,m291,LENORE,Took preparation.
150409,L124401,u4398,m291,THEO,Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
150410,L124399,u4393,m291,LENORE,That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
150411,L124398,u4398,m291,THEO,Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
150412,L124393,u4398,m291,THEO,Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
150413,L124392,u4393,m291,LENORE,Both hands on your lap.
150414,L124357,u4393,m291,LENORE,He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
150415,L124356,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm handling it.
150416,L124349,u4398,m291,THEO,That's how it's going to be.
150417,L124348,u4393,m291,LENORE,That's not good enough.
150418,L124347,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
150419,L124337,u4393,m291,LENORE,Only one way to find out.
150420,L124336,u4398,m291,THEO,Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
150421,L124335,u4393,m291,LENORE,Naturally.
150422,L124334,u4398,m291,THEO,Naturally.
150423,L124333,u4393,m291,LENORE,You're the man with the gun.
150424,L124332,u4398,m291,THEO,Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
150425,L124331,u4393,m291,LENORE,We can't leave him to repeat anything.
150426,L124330,u4398,m291,THEO,What's your point?
150427,L124329,u4393,m291,LENORE,He might've heard everything we said in the car.
150428,L124328,u4398,m291,THEO,That's a reasonable possibility.
150429,L124327,u4393,m291,LENORE,The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
150430,L124326,u4398,m291,THEO,What's really on your wicked little mind?
150431,L124325,u4398,m291,THEO,"How about ""later?"""
150432,L124324,u4393,m291,LENORE,Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
150433,L124323,u4398,m291,THEO,"Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion."
150434,L124321,u4393,m291,LENORE,We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
150435,L124320,u4398,m291,THEO,You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
150436,L124319,u4393,m291,LENORE,As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
150437,L124318,u4398,m291,THEO,"Who'd ever think, to look at you?"
150438,L124317,u4398,m291,THEO,I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
150439,L124316,u4393,m291,LENORE,Why are we stopping?
150440,L124315,u4398,m291,THEO,Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
150441,L124314,u4398,m291,THEO,"I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  ""Her,"" I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors."
150442,L124313,u4393,m291,LENORE,Think you could do a picture of me?
150443,L124312,u4398,m291,THEO,That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
150444,L124311,u4393,m291,LENORE,They did some great job of reforming you.
150445,L124310,u4398,m291,THEO,I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
150446,L124309,u4393,m291,LENORE,Any idea where you're going?
150447,L124306,u4393,m291,LENORE,"The money, Nels ... ?"
150448,L124305,u4398,m291,THEO,Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
150449,L124304,u4393,m291,LENORE,I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
150450,L124303,u4398,m291,THEO,What's happening?
150451,L124302,u4393,m291,LENORE,Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
150452,L124301,u4398,m291,THEO,That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
150453,L124300,u4393,m291,LENORE,They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
150454,L124291,u4398,m291,THEO,Ask them.
150455,L124290,u4393,m291,LENORE,Do you think they'll walk away?
150456,L124271,u4398,m291,THEO,Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
150457,L124270,u4393,m291,LENORE,259-7881.
150458,L124269,u4398,m291,THEO,What's Nels' number?
150459,L124268,u4393,m291,LENORE,"No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now."
150460,L124267,u4398,m291,THEO,It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
150461,L124257,u4398,m291,THEO,Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
150462,L124256,u4393,m291,LENORE,Did you hear that?
150463,L124255,u4398,m291,THEO,"Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody."
150464,L124254,u4393,m291,LENORE,He wants 75 back.
150465,L124253,u4398,m291,THEO,Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
150466,L124252,u4393,m291,LENORE,I'm still okay.
150467,L124249,u4398,m291,THEO,Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!
150468,L124248,u4393,m291,LENORE,Stop talking like that!
150469,L124247,u4398,m291,THEO,"Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --"
150470,L124246,u4393,m291,LENORE,You wouldn't --
150471,L124245,u4398,m291,THEO,Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
150472,L124244,u4393,m291,LENORE,You could've hit me.
150473,L124243,u4398,m291,THEO,Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
150474,L124242,u4398,m291,THEO,You're enjoying this too much.
150475,L124241,u4393,m291,LENORE,"I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face."
150476,L124240,u4398,m291,THEO,I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
150477,L124239,u4393,m291,LENORE,Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
150478,L124238,u4398,m291,THEO,You were at the Emerald that night?
150479,L124237,u4393,m291,LENORE,"Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel."
150480,L124236,u4398,m291,THEO,"You, I would've noticed."
150481,L124235,u4393,m291,LENORE,I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
150482,L124234,u4398,m291,THEO,What's that supposed to me?
150483,L124233,u4393,m291,LENORE,A typical fuck-up.
150484,L124232,u4398,m291,THEO,Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
150485,L124231,u4393,m291,LENORE,I don't hear him moving around anymore.
150486,L124230,u4398,m291,THEO,"Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk."
150487,L124229,u4393,m291,LENORE,The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
150488,L124228,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
150489,L124227,u4393,m291,LENORE,He seems to be headed for Topanga.
150490,L124226,u4398,m291,THEO,Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
150491,L124225,u4393,m291,LENORE,Do you have to point that?
150492,L124224,u4398,m291,THEO,We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
150493,L124223,u4393,m291,LENORE,You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
150494,L124222,u4398,m291,THEO,Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
150495,L124221,u4393,m291,LENORE,He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
150496,L124220,u4398,m291,THEO,Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
150497,L124216,u4398,m291,THEO,Assure them that you're being well treated.
150498,L124215,u4393,m291,LENORE,There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
150499,L124214,u4398,m291,THEO,Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
150500,L124213,u4393,m291,LENORE,Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
150501,L124212,u4398,m291,THEO,L.A.P.D.
150502,L124211,u4393,m291,LENORE,Who's in back?
150503,L124210,u4398,m291,THEO,You knew about me.
150504,L124209,u4393,m291,LENORE,Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
150505,L124208,u4398,m291,THEO,"Why pick me to be your ""mark?"""
150506,L124207,u4393,m291,LENORE,Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
150507,L124206,u4398,m291,THEO,There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
150508,L124205,u4393,m291,LENORE,I thought it was inspired.
150509,L124204,u4398,m291,THEO,And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
150510,L124203,u4393,m291,LENORE,As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
150511,L124202,u4398,m291,THEO,I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
150512,L124201,u4393,m291,LENORE,They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
150513,L124200,u4398,m291,THEO,You timed that beautifully.
150514,L124199,u4393,m291,LENORE,Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
150515,L124198,u4398,m291,THEO,At least one.
150516,L124197,u4393,m291,LENORE,"The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses."
150517,L124196,u4398,m291,THEO,Damned if I know.
150518,L124195,u4393,m291,LENORE,Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
150519,L124194,u4398,m291,THEO,The guy with the transplant.
150520,L124193,u4393,m291,LENORE,It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
150521,L124192,u4398,m291,THEO,Whose money is this?
150522,L124191,u4393,m291,LENORE,There isn't any such person.
150523,L124190,u4398,m291,THEO,You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
150524,L124186,u4393,m291,LENORE,The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
150525,L124185,u4398,m291,THEO,Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
150526,L124184,u4393,m291,LENORE,He had a gun.  I have it now.
150527,L124182,u4393,m291,LENORE,Hand me the phone.
150528,L124181,u4398,m291,THEO,For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
150529,L124177,u4398,m291,THEO,Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
150530,L124176,u4393,m291,LENORE,They put their hands all over me.
150531,L124175,u4398,m291,THEO,So far they're keeping their part of it.
150532,L124174,u4393,m291,LENORE,They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
150533,L124173,u4398,m291,THEO,We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
150534,L124172,u4393,m291,LENORE,You're going to let them get away with this?
150535,L124171,u4398,m291,THEO,Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
150536,L124170,u4393,m291,LENORE,Why didn't you just shoot them?
150537,L124169,u4398,m291,THEO,Now I have -- it's a long story.
150538,L124164,u4398,m291,THEO,Include me in that.
150539,L124163,u4393,m291,LENORE,She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
150540,L124162,u4398,m291,THEO,She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
150541,L124161,u4393,m291,LENORE,Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
150542,L124156,u4398,m291,THEO,Shit.  I'm sorry.
150543,L124155,u4393,m291,LENORE,It's locked.
150544,L124152,u4398,m291,THEO,Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
150545,L124151,u4393,m291,LENORE,Rachel -- Oh my God.
150546,L124146,u4393,m291,LENORE,I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
150547,L124145,u4398,m291,THEO,Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
150548,L124144,u4393,m291,LENORE,All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
150549,L124143,u4398,m291,THEO,She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
150550,L124142,u4393,m291,LENORE,Why can't it be her?
150551,L124141,u4398,m291,THEO,They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
150552,L124140,u4393,m291,LENORE,Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
150553,L124139,u4398,m291,THEO,Can you walk?
150554,L124138,u4393,m291,LENORE,Yes.
150555,L124137,u4398,m291,THEO,Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
150556,L124136,u4393,m291,LENORE,I can't do it.
150557,L124135,u4398,m291,THEO,She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
150558,L124134,u4393,m291,LENORE,I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
150559,L124133,u4398,m291,THEO,Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
150560,L124104,u4398,m291,THEO,Put the man back on.
150561,L124103,u4393,m291,LENORE,Yes sir.
150562,L124102,u4398,m291,THEO,Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
150563,L124101,u4393,m291,LENORE,Yes.
150564,L124100,u4398,m291,THEO,You're all three of you in that van?
150565,L124099,u4393,m291,LENORE,He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
150566,L124098,u4398,m291,THEO,Your husband?
150567,L124097,u4393,m291,LENORE,She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
150568,L124096,u4398,m291,THEO,That's coming off.  How about the girl?
150569,L124095,u4393,m291,LENORE,They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
150570,L124094,u4398,m291,THEO,Are you okay?
150571,L124093,u4393,m291,LENORE,Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
150572,L124022,u4393,m291,LENORE,They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
150573,L124021,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
150574,L124020,u4393,m291,LENORE,"God, if he doesn't come back --"
150575,L124019,u4398,m291,THEO,I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
150576,L124018,u4393,m291,LENORE,What did you do?
150577,L124017,u4398,m291,THEO,Lucky for them they didn't.
150578,L124016,u4393,m291,LENORE,They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
150579,L124015,u4398,m291,THEO,Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
150580,L124014,u4393,m291,LENORE,Yes?  Yes?
150581,L123983,u4398,m291,THEO,Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
150582,L123982,u4393,m291,LENORE,No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
150583,L123980,u4398,m291,THEO,Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
150584,L123979,u4393,m291,LENORE,Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
150585,L123978,u4398,m291,THEO,Or somebody else there is listening in --
150586,L123977,u4393,m291,LENORE,Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
150587,L123976,u4398,m291,THEO,Did you hear that click?
150588,L123975,u4393,m291,LENORE,No.
150589,L123974,u4398,m291,THEO,Did you jiggle the phone?
150590,L123972,u4393,m291,LENORE,When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
150591,L123971,u4398,m291,THEO,You can't give up.
150592,L123970,u4393,m291,LENORE,Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
150593,L123969,u4398,m291,THEO,Why tell me this?
150594,L123968,u4393,m291,LENORE,Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
150595,L123967,u4398,m291,THEO,I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
150596,L123966,u4393,m291,LENORE,But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
150597,L123965,u4398,m291,THEO,"Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody."
150598,L123964,u4393,m291,LENORE,"Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met."
150599,L123963,u4398,m291,THEO,It won't be him.
150600,L123962,u4393,m291,LENORE,"If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts, you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark."
150601,L123961,u4398,m291,THEO,I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
150602,L123960,u4393,m291,LENORE,The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
150603,L123959,u4398,m291,THEO,What's going on?
150604,L123958,u4393,m291,LENORE,Don't talk.  Don't talk!
150605,L123957,u4398,m291,THEO,How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
150606,L123956,u4393,m291,LENORE,To hide it from the I.R.S.
150607,L123955,u4398,m291,THEO,You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
150608,L123954,u4393,m291,LENORE,Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
150609,L123953,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
150610,L123952,u4393,m291,LENORE,It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
150611,L123951,u4398,m291,THEO,They've still got to be able to sign his name.
150612,L123950,u4393,m291,LENORE,Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
150613,L123949,u4398,m291,THEO,They'll recognize it's not your husband.
150614,L123948,u4393,m291,LENORE,I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
150615,L123947,u4398,m291,THEO,Do you know what's in that box?
150616,L123946,u4393,m291,LENORE,Don't say that.
150617,L123945,u4398,m291,THEO,Not a chance.
150618,L123944,u4393,m291,LENORE,Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
150619,L123943,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
150620,L123942,u4393,m291,LENORE,Even if you found us -- what then?
150621,L123941,u4398,m291,THEO,Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
150622,L123940,u4393,m291,LENORE,I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
150623,L123939,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
150624,L123936,u4398,m291,THEO,"Black Mercedes, 600S."
150625,L123935,u4393,m291,LENORE,What do you mean?
150626,L123934,u4398,m291,THEO,Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
150627,L123933,u4393,m291,LENORE,The City National on San Vincente.
150628,L123932,u4398,m291,THEO,What bank?
150629,L123931,u4393,m291,LENORE,The one in Brentwood.
150630,L123930,u4398,m291,THEO,You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
150631,L123929,u4393,m291,LENORE,When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
150632,L123928,u4398,m291,THEO,I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
150633,L123927,u4393,m291,LENORE,"It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried."
150634,L123926,u4398,m291,THEO,He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
150635,L123921,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm trying to.
150636,L123920,u4393,m291,LENORE,Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
150637,L123919,u4398,m291,THEO,She's gone --
150638,L123918,u4393,m291,LENORE,What's happening?
150639,L123909,u4398,m291,THEO,I've got to ask somebody.
150640,L123908,u4393,m291,LENORE,No.
150641,L123907,u4398,m291,THEO,Does she wear glasses?
150642,L123906,u4393,m291,LENORE,That's not her.
150643,L123905,u4398,m291,THEO,Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
150644,L123902,u4398,m291,THEO,Great.  Stay with me.  There must be a hundred kids out here.
150645,L123901,u4393,m291,LENORE,"I can hear you again, clearly."
150646,L123900,u4398,m291,THEO,"Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out."
150647,L123896,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
150648,L123895,u4393,m291,LENORE,Make a right.  You can't miss it.
150649,L123887,u4393,m291,LENORE,I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
150650,L123886,u4398,m291,THEO,There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
150651,L123885,u4393,m291,LENORE,You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
150652,L123884,u4398,m291,THEO,That makes two of us.
150653,L123883,u4393,m291,LENORE,I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
150654,L123882,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm about ten blocks from the school.
150655,L123881,u4393,m291,LENORE,I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
150656,L123880,u4398,m291,THEO,A price on everything.
150657,L123879,u4393,m291,LENORE,I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
150658,L123878,u4398,m291,THEO,"Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag."
150659,L123877,u4393,m291,LENORE,I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
150660,L123876,u4398,m291,THEO,"Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary."
150661,L123875,u4393,m291,LENORE,I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
150662,L123874,u4398,m291,THEO,They say my work is somewhat derivative.
150663,L123873,u4393,m291,LENORE,I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
150664,L123872,u4398,m291,THEO,Pictures.
150665,L123871,u4393,m291,LENORE,Our house always needs touching up.
150666,L123870,u4398,m291,THEO,Sometimes I paint.
150667,L123869,u4393,m291,LENORE,What do you do for a living?
150668,L123867,u4398,m291,THEO,Well you did.
150669,L123866,u4393,m291,LENORE,I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
150670,L123865,u4398,m291,THEO,I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
150671,L123864,u4393,m291,LENORE,And that was the end of it?
150672,L123863,u4398,m291,THEO,"It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  ""Click."" You don't exist."
150673,L123862,u4393,m291,LENORE,I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
150674,L123861,u4398,m291,THEO,"Hey drop it, okay?"
150675,L123860,u4393,m291,LENORE,A woman?
150676,L123859,u4398,m291,THEO,"I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of."
150677,L123858,u4393,m291,LENORE,Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
150678,L123857,u4398,m291,THEO,"I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops."
150679,L123856,u4393,m291,LENORE,How much time do you have left on it?
150680,L123855,u4398,m291,THEO,"Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit."
150681,L123854,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
150682,L123853,u4393,m291,LENORE,"They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun."
150683,L123852,u4398,m291,THEO,Tell me what she looks like.
150684,L123851,u4393,m291,LENORE,Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
150685,L123850,u4398,m291,THEO,What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
150686,L123849,u4393,m291,LENORE,What are you doing now?
150687,L123848,u4398,m291,THEO,I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
150688,L123847,u4393,m291,LENORE,What about the others?
150689,L123846,u4398,m291,THEO,Hello?  It's just me and you again.
150690,L123823,u4398,m291,THEO,Another minute.
150691,L123822,u4393,m291,LENORE,Will you please speak to me! Theo?
150692,L123817,u4398,m291,THEO,Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
150693,L123816,u4393,m291,LENORE,Why isn't anyone answering me?
150694,L123797,u4393,m291,LENORE,She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
150695,L123796,u4398,m291,THEO,Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
150696,L123795,u4393,m291,LENORE,26th off Wilshire.
150697,L123794,u4398,m291,THEO,Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
150698,L123793,u4393,m291,LENORE,"""Theo?"""
150699,L123777,u4398,m291,THEO,"He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!"
150700,L123776,u4393,m291,LENORE,He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
150701,L123774,u4393,m291,LENORE,They don't know you.  They won't listen.
150702,L123773,u4398,m291,THEO,Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
150703,L123772,u4393,m291,LENORE,The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
150704,L123769,u4398,m291,THEO,Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
150705,L123768,u4393,m291,LENORE,They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
150706,L123767,u4398,m291,THEO,What do they need her for?
150707,L123766,u4393,m291,LENORE,"Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine."
150708,L123765,u4398,m291,THEO,Stop throwing names at me.
150709,L123764,u4393,m291,LENORE,Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
150710,L123763,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm with two friends now.
150711,L123760,u4398,m291,THEO,Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
150712,L123759,u4393,m291,LENORE,They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
150713,L123758,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
150714,L123731,u4398,m291,THEO,I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello?
150715,L123730,u4393,m291,LENORE,I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
150716,L123729,u4398,m291,THEO,"Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?"
150717,L123717,u4398,m291,THEO,Shit!
150718,L123716,u4393,m291,LENORE,Please.
150719,L123715,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
150720,L123714,u4393,m291,LENORE,No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
150721,L123713,u4398,m291,THEO,"Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute."
150722,L123712,u4393,m291,LENORE,Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
150723,L123711,u4398,m291,THEO,Oh man.  These people mean business.
150724,L123710,u4393,m291,LENORE,Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
150725,L123709,u4398,m291,THEO,Who?
150726,L123708,u4393,m291,LENORE,He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
150727,L123707,u4398,m291,THEO,What makes you say that?
150728,L123706,u4393,m291,LENORE,One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
150729,L123705,u4398,m291,THEO,The cops could trace this call back to you.
150730,L123704,u4393,m291,LENORE,No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
150731,L123703,u4398,m291,THEO,Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
150732,L123702,u4393,m291,LENORE,No -- nothing.
150733,L123701,u4398,m291,THEO,Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
150734,L123700,u4393,m291,LENORE,I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
150735,L123699,u4398,m291,THEO,Where'd they take you to?
150736,L123698,u4393,m291,LENORE,They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
150737,L123697,u4398,m291,THEO,Why would anybody want to hurt you?
150738,L123696,u4393,m291,LENORE,Then hang up!  Do it!
150739,L123695,u4398,m291,THEO,Don't lay this on me!
150740,L123694,u4393,m291,LENORE,Because you know you'll be killing us.
150741,L123693,u4398,m291,THEO,Oh won't I?
150742,L123692,u4393,m291,LENORE,You won't disconnect.
150743,L123691,u4398,m291,THEO,I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
150744,L123690,u4393,m291,LENORE,I realize you don't want to be involved.
150745,L123689,u4398,m291,THEO,Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
150746,L123688,u4393,m291,LENORE,My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
150747,L123687,u4398,m291,THEO,I don't want to know --
150748,L123686,u4393,m291,LENORE,My name is --
150749,L123685,u4398,m291,THEO,You're the one who's not to be believed.
150750,L123684,u4393,m291,LENORE,I don't believe you.
150751,L123683,u4398,m291,THEO,You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
150752,L123682,u4393,m291,LENORE,I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
150753,L123681,u4398,m291,THEO,"Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some ""put-on,"" right?"
150754,L123680,u4393,m291,LENORE,They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
150755,L123679,u4398,m291,THEO,Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
150756,L123678,u4393,m291,LENORE,They're holding my husband downstairs.
150757,L123677,u4398,m291,THEO,Who smashed the phone?
150758,L123676,u4393,m291,LENORE,They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
150759,L123675,u4398,m291,THEO,What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
150760,L123674,u4393,m291,LENORE,You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
150761,L123673,u4398,m291,THEO,"Lady, try making some sense."
150762,L123672,u4393,m291,LENORE,I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
150763,L123671,u4398,m291,THEO,And what're you whispering for?
150764,L123670,u4393,m291,LENORE,Will you let me explain!
150765,L123669,u4398,m291,THEO,No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
150766,L123668,u4393,m291,LENORE,You don't understand.
150767,L123667,u4398,m291,THEO,If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
150768,L123666,u4393,m291,LENORE,I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
150769,L123665,u4398,m291,THEO,Do I know you?
150770,L124516,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
150771,L124515,u4394,m291,LENORE'S VOICE,"Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --"
150772,L124514,u4398,m291,THEO,Didn't we play this scene before?
150773,L124513,u4394,m291,LENORE'S VOICE,Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
150774,L123664,u4394,m291,LENORE'S VOICE,You mustn't hang up.
150775,L123663,u4398,m291,THEO,Who is this?
150776,L123662,u4394,m291,LENORE'S VOICE,Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
150777,L124188,u4398,m291,THEO,What are you planning to do when they got here?  They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel.
150778,L124187,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Yeah.  Why don't we?
150779,L124179,u4398,m291,THEO,Put the girl on.
150780,L124178,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Seems like it.
150781,L124167,u4398,m291,THEO,Next I want to see Rachel.  Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  Keep her calm.  Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
150782,L124166,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Don't worry.
150783,L124165,u4398,m291,THEO,Count it.
150784,L124160,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm backing up.
150785,L124159,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
150786,L124158,u4398,m291,THEO,Stop the crying.
150787,L124150,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
150788,L124149,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
150789,L124148,u4398,m291,THEO,Are you trying to panic the women?
150790,L124147,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
150791,L124128,u4398,m291,THEO,I won't let 'em.
150792,L124127,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
150793,L124126,u4398,m291,THEO,"You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways."
150794,L124125,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,And then?
150795,L124124,u4398,m291,THEO,Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
150796,L124123,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,And not a nickel.
150797,L124122,u4398,m291,THEO,You'll still have the girl and the husband.
150798,L124121,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Negative.
150799,L124120,u4398,m291,THEO,Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
150800,L124119,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
150801,L124118,u4398,m291,THEO,My pleasure --
150802,L124117,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
150803,L124116,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
150804,L124115,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,You should've done all this before.
150805,L124114,u4398,m291,THEO,"I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is."
150806,L124113,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,It's in the process.
150807,L124112,u4398,m291,THEO,Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
150808,L124111,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,We're waiting on you.
150809,L124109,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,"We're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  It just changed.  We're in a grey van.  It reads ""<u>Noble Carpet Cleaners</u>."""
150810,L124108,u4398,m291,THEO,I still don't see you.
150811,L124107,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,I don't know what you mean.
150812,L124106,u4398,m291,THEO,You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
150813,L124105,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Satisfied?
150814,L124092,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Talk to the man.
150815,L124091,u4398,m291,THEO,I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
150816,L124090,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,You'll see her.
150817,L124089,u4398,m291,THEO,I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
150818,L124088,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Just relax.
150819,L124087,u4398,m291,THEO,"Fucking ""A"" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here."
150820,L124086,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,It's your call.
150821,L124085,u4398,m291,THEO,I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
150822,L124084,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Stay there.
150823,L124083,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
150824,L124082,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,We don't see you.
150825,L124081,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm here.  Where are you?
150826,L124057,u4398,m291,THEO,I wish it had never been invented.
150827,L124056,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
150828,L124055,u4398,m291,THEO,Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
150829,L124054,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,308-9962.
150830,L124053,u4398,m291,THEO,Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
150831,L124052,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Sure.
150832,L124051,u4398,m291,THEO,Got a phone in that van?
150833,L124050,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
150834,L124049,u4398,m291,THEO,Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
150835,L124048,u4398,m291,THEO,There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
150836,L124047,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Some loyalty.
150837,L124046,u4398,m291,THEO,I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
150838,L124045,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,We can be there.
150839,L124044,u4398,m291,THEO,It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
150840,L124043,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,What time frame have you got in mind?
150841,L124042,u4398,m291,THEO,A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
150842,L124041,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Pass.
150843,L124040,u4398,m291,THEO,It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
150844,L124039,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Where do we meet?
150845,L124036,u4398,m291,THEO,Granted.  But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.
150846,L124035,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,There are no guarantees in this life.
150847,L124034,u4398,m291,THEO,You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
150848,L124033,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Keep talking.
150849,L124032,u4398,m291,THEO,You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
150850,L124031,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,"You're up on your details, aren't you?"
150851,L124030,u4398,m291,THEO,They saw you kill the driver.
150852,L124029,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
150853,L124028,u4398,m291,THEO,You're making it too easy.
150854,L124027,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Whatever you say.
150855,L124026,u4398,m291,THEO,Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
150856,L124025,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Twenty percent.
150857,L124024,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
150858,L124023,u4395,m291,MALE VOICE,Who are you working for?
150859,L124511,u4396,m291,NELSON,Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
150860,L124510,u4398,m291,THEO,I'm in awe.
150861,L124508,u4396,m291,NELSON,Nobody can do anything right but you!
150862,L124507,u4398,m291,THEO,Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
150863,L124506,u4396,m291,NELSON,Them.  They won't be expecting us.
150864,L124505,u4398,m291,THEO,Who were you talking to?
150865,L124498,u4396,m291,NELSON,Stay put!  I know my way around.
150866,L124497,u4398,m291,THEO,Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
150867,L124495,u4396,m291,NELSON,Are you busting my chops or what?
150868,L124494,u4398,m291,THEO,Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
150869,L124493,u4396,m291,NELSON,In your dreams.
150870,L124492,u4398,m291,THEO,"Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my ""patron,"" Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts."
150871,L124491,u4398,m291,THEO,At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
150872,L124490,u4396,m291,NELSON,"None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty."
150873,L124489,u4398,m291,THEO,Where's the backpack?
150874,L124488,u4396,m291,NELSON,I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
150875,L124487,u4398,m291,THEO,Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
150876,L124479,u4398,m291,THEO,Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
150877,L124478,u4396,m291,NELSON,How do you know?
150878,L124477,u4398,m291,THEO,We're gonna get there first.
150879,L124476,u4396,m291,NELSON,And make ourselves a hell of a target.
150880,L124475,u4398,m291,THEO,Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
150881,L124474,u4396,m291,NELSON,Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
150882,L124473,u4398,m291,THEO,Where do I turn?
150883,L124472,u4396,m291,NELSON,Five minutes.
150884,L124471,u4398,m291,THEO,How far off are you?
150885,L124470,u4398,m291,THEO,Take the 405 south.
150886,L124469,u4396,m291,NELSON,In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
150887,L124466,u4398,m291,THEO,Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
150888,L124465,u4396,m291,NELSON,Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
150889,L124464,u4398,m291,THEO,You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
150890,L124463,u4396,m291,NELSON,I can see the benefit in that.
150891,L124458,u4398,m291,THEO,My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
150892,L124457,u4396,m291,NELSON,That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
150893,L124456,u4398,m291,THEO,"Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity."
150894,L124455,u4396,m291,NELSON,Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
150895,L124454,u4398,m291,THEO,I suppose you're in your taxi?
150896,L124453,u4396,m291,NELSON,What does it take to kill you?
150897,L124452,u4398,m291,THEO,I thought you'd know me by now.
150898,L124451,u4396,m291,NELSON,Who's this?
150899,L124450,u4398,m291,THEO,Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
150900,L124449,u4396,m291,NELSON,Yeah?
150901,L124354,u4398,m291,THEO,"You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels."
150902,L124353,u4396,m291,NELSON,I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
150903,L124352,u4398,m291,THEO,Yeah?
150904,L124288,u4398,m291,THEO,Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
150905,L124287,u4396,m291,NELSON,And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
150906,L124286,u4398,m291,THEO,From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
150907,L124285,u4396,m291,NELSON,You want us to get ourselves killed?
150908,L124284,u4398,m291,THEO,Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.

151530,L125303,u4408,m292,JUDE,We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
151531,L125299,u4405,m292,FERGUS,Suits you.
151532,L125298,u4408,m292,JUDE,Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?

151553,L124568,u4408,m292,JUDE,There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.

151593,L124836,u4405,m292,FERGUS,Would make me feel better about it.
151594,L124835,u4409,m292,MAGUIRE,Why do you want to do that for?

151604,L124750,u4409,m292,MAGUIRE,And do you know why?

151612,L124737,u4405,m292,FERGUS,"It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all."
151613,L124736,u4409,m292,MAGUIRE,What the fuck is this?

151616,L124621,u4409,m292,MAGUIRE,"You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at."
151617,L124619,u4405,m292,FERGUS,He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
151618,L124618,u4409,m292,MAGUIRE,You sure?

151637,L124874,u4407,m292,JODY,"So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?"
151638,L124873,u4405,m292,FERGUS,Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
151639,L124872,u4407,m292,JODY,Faster than cricket?

151641,L124870,u4407,m292,JODY,"Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?"
151642,L124869,u4405,m292,FERGUS,Stop that talk now --
151643,L124868,u4407,m292,JODY,Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --

151651,L124856,u4405,m292,FERGUS,Nothing.
151652,L124855,u4407,m292,JODY,What does that mean?
151653,L124854,u4405,m292,FERGUS,I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...

151668,L124820,u4407,m292,JODY,Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
151669,L124819,u4405,m292,FERGUS,I told you not to talk that way --
151670,L124818,u4407,m292,JODY,Take the whole lot. I won't need it.

151675,L124812,u4405,m292,FERGUS,Don't think that way.
151676,L124811,u4407,m292,JODY,If they kill me --
151677,L124810,u4405,m292,FERGUS,What?

151716,L124762,u4405,m292,FERGUS,Why?
151717,L124761,u4407,m292,JODY,"Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man."

151719,L124734,u4407,m292,JODY,Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.

151915,L126749,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"But Charles' appointment was last week, not --"
151916,L126748,u4411,m293,ADAM,Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
151917,L126747,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Now what?
151918,L126746,u4411,m293,ADAM,It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
151919,L126745,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- lyses! Adam -- that was it! The garden!"
151920,L126742,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on."
151921,L126741,u4411,m293,ADAM,"There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?"
151922,L126740,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Of course there is!
151923,L126739,u4411,m293,ADAM,Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
151924,L126738,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law."
151925,L126737,u4411,m293,ADAM,"Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for."
151926,L126736,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I think it only said where -- but I can't --
151927,L126735,u4411,m293,ADAM,With whom? Where?
151928,L126734,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
151929,L126733,u4411,m293,ADAM,Can you remember anything at all?
151930,L126732,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important."
151931,L126729,u4411,m293,ADAM,Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
151932,L126728,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?"
151933,L126727,u4411,m293,ADAM,Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
151934,L126720,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No -- last time I said ""I love you, Alex."""
151935,L126719,u4411,m293,ADAM,"Yes, you told me."
151936,L126718,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I love you, Adam."
151937,L126717,u4411,m293,ADAM,Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
151938,L126716,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Well, I guess that's it -- dead end."
151939,L126715,u4411,m293,ADAM,Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
151940,L126714,u4421,m293,REGGIE,The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
151941,L126713,u4411,m293,ADAM,"It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?"
151942,L126710,u4411,m293,ADAM,The letter --
151943,L126709,u4421,m293,REGGIE,To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
151944,L126708,u4411,m293,ADAM,Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
151945,L126704,u4411,m293,ADAM,"I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now."
151946,L126703,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Lord, you're stubborn."
151947,L126702,u4411,m293,ADAM,Let's look anyway.
151948,L126701,u4421,m293,REGGIE,But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
151949,L126699,u4411,m293,ADAM,I sure am. Get it.
151950,L126698,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Lord, you're stubborn."
151951,L126697,u4411,m293,ADAM,Where's that airlines bag?
151952,L126696,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --"
151953,L126695,u4411,m293,ADAM,I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
151954,L126694,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Why?
151955,L126693,u4411,m293,ADAM,I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
151956,L126692,u4411,m293,ADAM,Open up.
151957,L126691,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What is it?
151958,L126686,u4411,m293,ADAM,There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
151959,L126685,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Adam --
151960,L126684,u4411,m293,ADAM,"If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?"
151961,L126683,u4421,m293,REGGIE,You're going to look for him -- now?
151962,L126682,u4411,m293,ADAM,That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
151963,L126666,u4411,m293,ADAM,Relax -- you're gaining.
151964,L126665,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
151965,L126664,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Well -- come on.
151966,L126663,u4411,m293,ADAM,"When you come on, you really come on."
151967,L126662,u4411,m293,ADAM,No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
151968,L126661,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
151969,L126660,u4411,m293,ADAM,How do you think I got here?
151970,L126659,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
151971,L126658,u4411,m293,ADAM,"Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do."
151972,L126657,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
151973,L126656,u4411,m293,ADAM,Why do you think I brought you here?
151974,L126655,u4421,m293,REGGIE,You don't look so bad in this light.
151975,L126654,u4411,m293,ADAM,It's all right -- look.
151976,L126653,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Adam!
151977,L126652,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
151978,L126651,u4411,m293,ADAM,What's the matter?
151979,L126650,u4411,m293,ADAM,It's lovely.
151980,L126649,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What about it?
151981,L126648,u4411,m293,ADAM,"Oh, you should see your face."
151982,L126647,u4411,m293,ADAM,Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
151983,L126646,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What?
151984,L126645,u4411,m293,ADAM,"It's a toss-up, I can tell you that."
151985,L126644,u4421,m293,REGGIE,No -- I guess not.
151986,L126643,u4411,m293,ADAM,What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
151987,L126642,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Oh!
151988,L126641,u4411,m293,ADAM,That's right.
151989,L126640,u4421,m293,REGGIE,All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
151990,L126639,u4411,m293,ADAM,How was I leading you on?
151991,L126638,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
151992,L126637,u4411,m293,ADAM,I think that's what you ordered.
151993,L126636,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I could eat a horse.
151994,L126633,u4411,m293,ADAM,"Yes, but --"
151995,L126632,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
151996,L126631,u4411,m293,ADAM,It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
151997,L126630,u4421,m293,REGGIE,-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
151998,L126629,u4411,m293,ADAM,"Oh, come on!"
151999,L126839,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye."
152000,L126838,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert."
152001,L126837,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope."
152002,L126836,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?"
152003,L126835,u4421,m293,REGGIE,The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
152004,L126834,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?"
152005,L126591,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful."
152006,L126590,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Are you sure there's no mistake?
152007,L126589,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother."
152008,L126588,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening."
152009,L126587,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --"
152010,L126586,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Yes -- ?
152011,L126285,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Agents.
152012,L126284,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies."
152013,L126283,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Me? Why me?
152014,L126282,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?"
152015,L126281,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Oh. Then who's this one?
152016,L126280,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington."
152017,L126279,u4421,m293,REGGIE,But no one actually saw him die.
152018,L126278,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"No, Mrs. Lampert."
152019,L126277,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
152020,L126276,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
152021,L126275,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?"
152022,L126274,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,That's the spirit.
152023,L126273,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country."
152024,L126272,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you."
152025,L126271,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight."
152026,L126270,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back."
152027,L126269,u4421,m293,REGGIE,But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
152028,L126268,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
152029,L126267,u4421,m293,REGGIE,But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
152030,L126266,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again."
152031,L126263,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --"
152032,L126262,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?"
152033,L126261,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
152034,L126256,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"May I have a cigarette, please?"
152035,L126255,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked."
152036,L126254,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Steal it how?
152037,L126253,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money."
152038,L126252,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --"
152039,L126250,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Can I at least keep the onion soup?
152040,L126249,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here."
152041,L126248,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge."
152042,L126247,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Caf.
152043,L126244,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --"
152044,L126243,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Barely, yes."
152045,L126242,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
152046,L126241,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
152047,L126240,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
152048,L126239,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
152049,L126236,u4421,m293,REGGIE,You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
152050,L126235,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson."
152051,L126234,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Carson?
152052,L126233,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,That's not Carson Dyle.
152053,L126232,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No, what?"
152054,L126231,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,No.
152055,L126230,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really."
152056,L126229,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Describe him.
152057,L126228,u4421,m293,REGGIE,He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
152058,L126227,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?"
152059,L126226,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Dyle, or whatever his name is."
152060,L126225,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Who?
152061,L126224,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it."
152062,L126223,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Agents.
152063,L126222,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies."
152064,L126221,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Were you followed?
152065,L126220,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?"
152066,L126206,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there."
152067,L126205,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
152068,L126204,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!"
152069,L126203,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband."
152070,L126014,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles."
152071,L126013,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Oh.
152072,L126012,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Because they're still here.
152073,L126011,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Why not?
152074,L126010,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!"
152075,L126009,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes."
152076,L126008,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?"
152077,L126007,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself."
152078,L126006,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?"
152079,L126005,u4421,m293,REGGIE,But --
152080,L126004,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it."
152081,L126003,u4421,m293,REGGIE,You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
152082,L126002,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it."
152083,L126001,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it."
152084,L126000,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it."
152085,L125999,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Thanks very much.
152086,L125998,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,I believe you.
152087,L125997,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
152088,L125996,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
152089,L125995,u4421,m293,REGGIE,But I don't have it.
152090,L125994,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,And I'm afraid we want it back.
152091,L125993,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Oh, I see."
152092,L125992,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Ours.
152093,L125991,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Then whose is it? His or theirs?
152094,L125990,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear."
152095,L125989,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"But it's Charles's money, not theirs."
152096,L125988,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly."
152097,L125987,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me."
152098,L125986,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance."
152099,L125985,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job!
152100,L125984,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
152101,L125983,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
152102,L125982,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger."
152103,L125966,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
152104,L125965,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
152105,L125964,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --"
152106,L125963,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Very sweet.
152107,L125962,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr."
152108,L125961,u4421,m293,REGGIE,His -- real -- ?
152109,L125960,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name."
152110,L125959,u4421,m293,REGGIE,So that was it.
152111,L125958,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency."
152112,L125957,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"May I have a sandwich, please?"
152113,L125956,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
152114,L125955,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?"
152115,L125954,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
152116,L125953,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Agent.
152117,L125952,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --"
152118,L125951,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --"
152119,L125950,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --"
152120,L125949,u4421,m293,REGGIE,We? You mean you're --?
152121,L125948,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Only we call them agents.
152122,L125947,u4421,m293,REGGIE,You mean spies and things like that?
152123,L125946,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
152124,L125945,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?"
152125,L125944,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?"
152126,L125943,u4421,m293,REGGIE,No thanks.
152127,L125942,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst."
152128,L125940,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
152129,L125939,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
152130,L125938,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow."
152131,L125936,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,"Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late."
152132,L125935,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
152133,L125934,u4412,m293,BARTHOLOMEW,I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
152134,L125981,u4422,m293,REGGIE'S VOICE,"No, thank heaven."
152135,L125980,u4413,m293,BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE,"Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?"
152136,L125979,u4422,m293,REGGIE'S VOICE,That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
152137,L125978,u4413,m293,BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE,"The last one, please."
152138,L125977,u4422,m293,REGGIE'S VOICE,No.
152139,L125976,u4413,m293,BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE,"Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?"
152140,L125975,u4422,m293,REGGIE'S VOICE,"Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one."
152141,L125974,u4413,m293,BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE,"Next, please."
152142,L125973,u4422,m293,REGGIE'S VOICE,No.
152143,L125972,u4413,m293,BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE,Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
152144,L125971,u4422,m293,REGGIE'S VOICE,It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
152145,L125970,u4413,m293,BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE,"1944. The next face, please."
152146,L125969,u4422,m293,REGGIE'S VOICE,He looks so young -- when was this taken?
152147,L125968,u4413,m293,BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE,Very good.
152148,L125967,u4422,m293,REGGIE'S VOICE,It's Charles!
152149,L126978,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,"Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?"
152150,L126977,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you."
152151,L126976,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
152152,L126975,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?"
152153,L126974,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,"Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then."
152154,L126973,u4421,m293,REGGIE,You'd lie about anything.
152155,L126972,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
152156,L126971,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
152157,L126970,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
152158,L126969,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
152159,L126968,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
152160,L126967,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Oh.
152161,L126966,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,No.
152162,L126965,u4421,m293,REGGIE,But you're -- divorced?
152163,L126964,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,Yes.
152164,L126963,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
152165,L126962,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
152166,L126961,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
152167,L126960,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,Brian.
152168,L126959,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What's your first name today?
152169,L126958,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,"Okay, now -- hand over those stamps."
152170,L126957,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Starting with his own.
152171,L126956,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
152172,L126955,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Bartholomew?
152173,L126954,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
152174,L126953,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Then how do I know this is your office?
152175,L126952,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
152176,L126951,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Around one.
152177,L126950,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,"When did you see him -- what time, I mean?"
152178,L126949,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?"
152179,L126948,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,"We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?"
152180,L126947,u4421,m293,REGGIE,You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
152181,L126946,u4414,m293,CRUIKSHANK,Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
152182,L126945,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --"
152183,L126452,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,I'll take that.
152184,L126451,u4415,m293,DYLE,We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
152185,L126450,u4415,m293,DYLE,"What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections."
152186,L126449,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,Not my room!
152187,L126446,u4415,m293,DYLE,It's all right with us --
152188,L126445,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,"He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?"
152189,L126442,u4415,m293,DYLE,"But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before."
152190,L126441,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
152191,L126438,u4415,m293,DYLE,Or you --  Or you --
152192,L126437,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,Me?
152193,L126436,u4415,m293,DYLE,"I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do."
152194,L126435,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,Then who does?
152195,L126434,u4415,m293,DYLE,And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
152196,L126336,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,That's the idea.
152197,L126335,u4415,m293,DYLE,Back where?
152198,L126333,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,"You're out, Dyle -- right now!"
152199,L126332,u4415,m293,DYLE,Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
152200,L126331,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,"And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?"
152201,L126330,u4415,m293,DYLE,Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
152202,L126329,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,"I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?"
152203,L126328,u4415,m293,DYLE,Very pretty. Now what?
152204,L126327,u4415,m293,DYLE,The view had better be worth it.
152205,L126326,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,Keep going.
152206,L126325,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,Open it.
152207,L126324,u4415,m293,DYLE,Do I knock or something?
152208,L126323,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,Okay -- up there.
152209,L126322,u4415,m293,DYLE,Sorry about that.
152210,L126321,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,I said with the mouth shut.
152211,L126320,u4415,m293,DYLE,How long do you intend -- ?
152212,L126319,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,We wait -- with our mouths shut.
152213,L126318,u4415,m293,DYLE,What now?
152214,L126314,u4415,m293,DYLE,You'll wreck your raincoat.
152215,L126313,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,"If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?"
152216,L126628,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --"
152217,L126627,u4415,m293,DYLE,"The man's the same, even if the name isn't."
152218,L126626,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
152219,L126625,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield."
152220,L126624,u4421,m293,REGGIE,But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
152221,L126623,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Well, I can't really blame you -- not now."
152222,L126622,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't believe it.
152223,L126621,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing."
152224,L126620,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"You mean, you're a thief?"
152225,L126619,u4415,m293,DYLE,"When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss."
152226,L126618,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What do you mean?
152227,L126617,u4415,m293,DYLE,"It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support."
152228,L126616,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
152229,L126615,u4415,m293,DYLE,"After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible."
152230,L126614,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Go on.
152231,L126613,u4415,m293,DYLE,Are you going to listen?
152232,L126612,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Well!
152233,L126611,u4415,m293,DYLE,Why don't you shut up!
152234,L126610,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Fiction or non-fiction?
152235,L126609,u4415,m293,DYLE,Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
152236,L126608,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
152237,L126607,u4415,m293,DYLE,I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
152238,L126606,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
152239,L126605,u4415,m293,DYLE,I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
152240,L126604,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"It's a start, anyway."
152241,L126603,u4415,m293,DYLE,What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
152242,L126602,u4415,m293,DYLE,Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
152243,L126601,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?"
152244,L126600,u4415,m293,DYLE,No -- not yet.
152245,L126599,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it."
152246,L126598,u4415,m293,DYLE,Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
152247,L126597,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
152248,L126596,u4415,m293,DYLE,Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
152249,L126583,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't believe it.
152250,L126582,u4415,m293,DYLE,Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
152251,L126581,u4421,m293,REGGIE,How often do you go through this little ritual?
152252,L126580,u4415,m293,DYLE,"The suit needs it more than I do, anyway."
152253,L126577,u4415,m293,DYLE,I don't think I know that one.
152254,L126576,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Shut the door!
152255,L126575,u4415,m293,DYLE,I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
152256,L126574,u4415,m293,DYLE,Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
152257,L126573,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What are you doing?
152258,L126572,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I dare you.
152259,L126571,u4415,m293,DYLE,Then I suggest you call one of them.
152260,L126570,u4421,m293,REGGIE,This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
152261,L126569,u4415,m293,DYLE,Reggie -- open the door.
152262,L126568,u4421,m293,REGGIE,The shower's in there.
152263,L126567,u4415,m293,DYLE,Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
152264,L126566,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Got you.
152265,L126555,u4415,m293,DYLE,Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
152266,L126554,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
152267,L126552,u4421,m293,REGGIE,No --
152268,L126551,u4415,m293,DYLE,What? Assassinate somebody?
152269,L126550,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?"
152270,L126549,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Yes, I know."
152271,L126548,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too."
152272,L126547,u4415,m293,DYLE,Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
152273,L126546,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed."
152274,L126545,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you."
152275,L126544,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm scared.
152276,L126543,u4415,m293,DYLE,Hm?
152277,L126542,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Alex --
152278,L126541,u4415,m293,DYLE,No sense messing up the streets.
152279,L126540,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm sorry.
152280,L126539,u4415,m293,DYLE,"I'd love some, thanks."
152281,L126538,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?"
152282,L126537,u4415,m293,DYLE,What -- like Scobie?
152283,L126536,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?"
152284,L126535,u4415,m293,DYLE,Who?
152285,L126534,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
152286,L126533,u4415,m293,DYLE,"A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon."
152287,L126532,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What's so illogical about that?
152288,L126531,u4415,m293,DYLE,Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
152289,L126530,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
152290,L126529,u4415,m293,DYLE,Why?
152291,L126528,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I think Tex did it.
152292,L126526,u4421,m293,REGGIE,You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
152293,L126525,u4415,m293,DYLE,Maybe.
152294,L126524,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Or Tex?
152295,L126523,u4415,m293,DYLE,Maybe.
152296,L126522,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
152297,L126495,u4421,m293,REGGIE,No.
152298,L126494,u4415,m293,DYLE,Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
152299,L126457,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt."
152300,L126456,u4415,m293,DYLE,He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
152301,L126455,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
152302,L126454,u4415,m293,DYLE,Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
152303,L126427,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
152304,L126426,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see."
152305,L126415,u4415,m293,DYLE,I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
152306,L126414,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?"
152307,L126413,u4415,m293,DYLE,Tuesday.
152308,L126412,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What day is it?
152309,L126410,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'll be right there.
152310,L126409,u4415,m293,DYLE,That sounds like their problem.
152311,L126408,u4421,m293,REGGIE,They've got Jean-Louis!
152312,L126403,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
152313,L126402,u4415,m293,DYLE,The phone's ringing --
152314,L126401,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I think I love you, Alex --"
152315,L126400,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Now please, Reggie -- cut it out."
152316,L126399,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Oh.
152317,L126398,u4415,m293,DYLE,But I'm not through complaining yet.
152318,L126397,u4421,m293,REGGIE,You did.
152319,L126396,u4415,m293,DYLE,Who told you to do that?
152320,L126395,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Cutting it out.
152321,L126394,u4415,m293,DYLE,What are you doing?
152322,L126393,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Okay.
152323,L126392,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Now please, Reggie -- cut it out."
152324,L126391,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
152325,L126390,u4415,m293,DYLE,Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
152326,L126389,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Said what?
152327,L126388,u4415,m293,DYLE,"There, you said it."
152328,L126387,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Why can't you be serious?
152329,L126386,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me."
152330,L126385,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm not fifteen.
152331,L126384,u4415,m293,DYLE,So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
152332,L126383,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
152333,L126382,u4415,m293,DYLE,Reggie -- listen to me --
152334,L126381,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee."
152335,L126379,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Come here.
152336,L126378,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Whitefoot, of course."
152337,L126377,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Which one are you?
152338,L126376,u4415,m293,DYLE,Why not a lying Blackfoot?
152339,L126375,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course."
152340,L126374,u4415,m293,DYLE,Because he's wearing moccasins.
152341,L126373,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
152342,L126372,u4415,m293,DYLE,"There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?"
152343,L126371,u4421,m293,REGGIE,There must be some way.
152344,L126370,u4415,m293,DYLE,You can't.
152345,L126369,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
152346,L126368,u4415,m293,DYLE,"I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this."
152347,L126367,u4421,m293,REGGIE,There -- you're a new man.
152348,L126366,u4415,m293,DYLE,I'm no easier to live with than he was.
152349,L126365,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I thought that was Peter Joshua.
152350,L126364,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Yes, but we're divorced."
152351,L126363,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
152352,L126362,u4415,m293,DYLE,Alexander.
152353,L126361,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
152354,L126360,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!"
152355,L126359,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Sure.
152356,L126358,u4415,m293,DYLE,Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
152357,L126357,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
152358,L126356,u4415,m293,DYLE,Would you like to see my passport?
152359,L126355,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
152360,L126354,u4415,m293,DYLE,Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
152361,L126353,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Does it hurt?
152362,L126352,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?"
152363,L126351,u4415,m293,DYLE,Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
152364,L126349,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
152365,L126348,u4415,m293,DYLE,I left him hanging around the American Express.
152366,L126347,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Scobie?
152367,L126346,u4415,m293,DYLE,I met a man with sharp nails.
152368,L126345,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
152369,L126312,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?"
152370,L126311,u4415,m293,DYLE,"The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that."
152371,L126310,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Your --
152372,L126309,u4415,m293,DYLE,"Yes, he is. He was my brother."
152373,L126308,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Carson Dyle is dead.
152374,L126307,u4415,m293,DYLE,But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
152375,L126306,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are."
152376,L126305,u4415,m293,DYLE,I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
152377,L126304,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Why you lied to me.
152378,L126303,u4415,m293,DYLE,No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
152379,L126302,u4421,m293,REGGIE,It's the only name I've got. How about you?
152380,L126301,u4415,m293,DYLE,Reggie?
152381,L126300,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Good morning, Mr. Dyle."
152382,L126830,u4416,m293,FLIX,No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
152383,L126829,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm -- I'm sorry.
152384,L126828,u4416,m293,FLIX,"I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these."
152385,L126827,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Please keep it.
152386,L126826,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Here's ten.
152387,L126825,u4416,m293,FLIX,"Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty."
152388,L126824,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?"
152389,L126823,u4416,m293,FLIX,"The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them."
152390,L126822,u4421,m293,REGGIE,And the last one?
152391,L126821,u4416,m293,FLIX,"A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps."
152392,L126820,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
152393,L126819,u4416,m293,FLIX,Forty-five thousand.
152394,L126818,u4421,m293,REGGIE,In money.
152395,L126817,u4416,m293,FLIX,In human life? In greed? In suffering?
152396,L126816,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What's its value today?
152397,L126815,u4416,m293,FLIX,It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
152398,L126814,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
152399,L126813,u4416,m293,FLIX,"In your money, perhaps $65,000."
152400,L126812,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm afraid it is important.
152401,L126811,u4416,m293,FLIX,The money is unimportant.
152402,L126810,u4421,m293,REGGIE,How much is it worth?
152403,L126809,u4416,m293,FLIX,"I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854."
152404,L126808,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
152405,L126807,u4416,m293,FLIX,"Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?"
152406,L126805,u4416,m293,FLIX,The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
152407,L126804,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Yes.
152408,L126803,u4416,m293,FLIX,"I was expecting you. You are American too, of course."
152409,L126802,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Monsieur Flix -- ?
152410,L126497,u4425,m293,TEX,The kid said --
152411,L126496,u4417,m293,GIDEON,"What do you mean, no?"
152412,L126478,u4417,m293,GIDEON,"Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too."
152413,L126477,u4425,m293,TEX,Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
152414,L126476,u4417,m293,GIDEON,You know I'd tell you if I had it.
152415,L126475,u4425,m293,TEX,"You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all."
152416,L126474,u4417,m293,GIDEON,Meaning what?
152417,L126473,u4425,m293,TEX,You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
152418,L126472,u4417,m293,GIDEON,Not unless we're blind.
152419,L126471,u4425,m293,TEX,There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
152420,L126470,u4417,m293,GIDEON,No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
152421,L126469,u4425,m293,TEX,You sure nuthin's missin'?
152422,L126468,u4417,m293,GIDEON,Why bother him?
152423,L126467,u4425,m293,TEX,And if it is?
152424,L126466,u4417,m293,GIDEON,"What for? If it's not here, why bother him?"
152425,L126148,u4425,m293,TEX,That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
152426,L126147,u4417,m293,GIDEON,I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
152427,L126131,u4425,m293,TEX,And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
152428,L126130,u4417,m293,GIDEON,"That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move."
152429,L126430,u4417,m293,GIDEON,She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
152430,L126429,u4421,m293,REGGIE,But his mother --
152431,L126428,u4417,m293,GIDEON,"I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert."
152432,L126055,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Stop it!
152433,L126054,u4417,m293,GIDEON,"Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --"
152434,L126053,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Leave me alone -- !
152435,L126052,u4417,m293,GIDEON,"Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead."
152436,L126051,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't know anything.
152437,L126050,u4417,m293,GIDEON,"It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?"
152438,L126049,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Tell me what?
152439,L126048,u4417,m293,GIDEON,"Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?"
152440,L126047,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What do you want?
152441,L126046,u4417,m293,GIDEON,Mrs. Lampert --
152442,L126680,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
152443,L126679,u4421,m293,REGGIE,No -- in my room.
152444,L126678,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,In Mr. Dyle's room?
152445,L126677,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I was, too."
152446,L125880,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,And this? And this?
152447,L125879,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't understand.
152448,L125878,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,And this?
152449,L125877,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Of course it is.
152450,L125876,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
152451,L125875,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Is that all? Can I go now?
152452,L125874,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
152453,L125873,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
152454,L125872,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Did you?
152455,L125871,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,"We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something."
152456,L125870,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"""My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed.""  Not very much, is it?"
152457,L125869,u4421,m293,REGGIE,A letter? May I see it?
152458,L125868,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,"Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --"
152459,L125867,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
152460,L125866,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,"One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  ""Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elyses""  Why there?"
152461,L125862,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I wish you wouldn't.
152462,L125861,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,Is it all right?
152463,L125860,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,It is all right.
152464,L125859,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I know.  I'm sorry.
152465,L125858,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,"C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!"
152466,L125857,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't know.
152467,L125856,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,"Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?"
152468,L125855,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't know.
152469,L125854,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,Where did he keep his money?
152470,L125853,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't know.
152471,L125852,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,About how wealthy would you say?
152472,L125851,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't know. I suppose so.
152473,L125850,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,He was a wealthy man?
152474,L125849,u4421,m293,REGGIE,He didn't have one.
152475,L125848,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,Oh. Swiss. His profession?
152476,L125847,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Swiss.
152477,L125846,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,He was American?
152478,L125845,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm very confused.
152479,L125844,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
152480,L125843,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Leave?
152481,L125842,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
152482,L125841,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm very cold.
152483,L125840,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,You loved him?
152484,L125837,u4418,m293,GRANDPIERRE,"I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?"
152485,L125836,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Yes.
152486,L126795,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,No -- but I will ask.
152487,L126794,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Flix lives?
152488,L126793,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,But he is gone.
152489,L126789,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?"
152490,L126788,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
152491,L126787,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
152492,L126499,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No, Jean-Louis."
152493,L126498,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,Up there! It is up there!
152494,L126491,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,We won! We won!
152495,L126490,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy."
152496,L126489,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,I found it! I found it!
152497,L126488,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy."
152498,L126486,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,Up there! I would put it up there!
152499,L126485,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Voil what?
152500,L126484,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,Oh.  Neither do I.  Voil!
152501,L126483,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
152502,L126482,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,I know. I would bury it in the garden.
152503,L126481,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?"
152504,L126459,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What should we give him?
152505,L126458,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,"Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?"
152506,L125830,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,Okay.
152507,L125829,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?"
152508,L125828,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,"Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --"
152509,L125763,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
152510,L125762,u4419,m293,JEAN-LOUIS,"Oh, la."
152511,L126200,u4420,m293,PETER,Good night.
152512,L126199,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Yes, I'll remember. Good night."
152513,L126198,u4420,m293,PETER,Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
152514,L126197,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Don't put yourself out.
152515,L126196,u4420,m293,PETER,Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
152516,L126195,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Words can hurt very much.
152517,L126194,u4420,m293,PETER,You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
152518,L126193,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What are you talking about?
152519,L126192,u4420,m293,PETER,"I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --"
152520,L126191,u4421,m293,REGGIE,How do you know what they're doing?
152521,L126190,u4420,m293,PETER,"They're only trying to scare you, that's all."
152522,L126189,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I believe what he said.
152523,L126188,u4420,m293,PETER,I wouldn't take that too seriously.
152524,L126187,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me."
152525,L126186,u4420,m293,PETER,What'd he say?
152526,L126184,u4420,m293,PETER,"What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?"
152527,L126183,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Yes -- that's right.
152528,L126179,u4421,m293,REGGIE,The man you had the fight with.
152529,L126178,u4420,m293,PETER,Who is it?
152530,L126174,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Do you tell lies?
152531,L126173,u4420,m293,PETER,Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
152532,L126172,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?"
152533,L126171,u4420,m293,PETER,That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
152534,L126170,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
152535,L126169,u4420,m293,PETER,"Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --"
152536,L126168,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust."
152537,L126167,u4420,m293,PETER,"No, they won't -- I won't let them."
152538,L126166,u4421,m293,REGGIE,But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
152539,L126165,u4420,m293,PETER,So they think he left it with you.
152540,L126164,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
152541,L126163,u4420,m293,PETER,"No, it isn't -- where's the money?"
152542,L126162,u4421,m293,REGGIE,That's all.
152543,L126161,u4420,m293,PETER,Go on.
152544,L126160,u4421,m293,REGGIE,A quarter of a million dollars.
152545,L126159,u4420,m293,PETER,What?
152546,L126158,u4421,m293,REGGIE,There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
152547,L126157,u4420,m293,PETER,"There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about."
152548,L126125,u4420,m293,PETER,You took the words right out of my mouth.
152549,L126124,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Be careful, Peter."
152550,L126123,u4420,m293,PETER,Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
152551,L126122,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him."
152552,L126121,u4420,m293,PETER,I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
152553,L126120,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Peter -- are you all right?
152554,L126113,u4420,m293,PETER,Good night.
152555,L126112,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Nothing. Good night.
152556,L126111,u4420,m293,PETER,What?
152557,L126110,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Do you know what's wrong with you?
152558,L126109,u4420,m293,PETER,"Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed."
152559,L126108,u4421,m293,REGGIE,How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
152560,L126107,u4420,m293,PETER,How would you like a spanking?
152561,L126106,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'"
152562,L126104,u4421,m293,REGGIE,How about once more around the park?
152563,L126103,u4420,m293,PETER,On the street where you live.
152564,L126102,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Where?
152565,L126101,u4420,m293,PETER,We're here.
152566,L126100,u4420,m293,PETER,Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
152567,L126099,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --"
152568,L126098,u4420,m293,PETER,What your husband was mixed up in.
152569,L126097,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What was what?
152570,L126096,u4420,m293,PETER,What was it?
152571,L126095,u4421,m293,REGGIE,How do you shave in there?
152572,L126094,u4420,m293,PETER,You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
152573,L126087,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime."
152574,L126086,u4420,m293,PETER,I wasn't --
152575,L126085,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
152576,L126084,u4420,m293,PETER,Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
152577,L126083,u4421,m293,REGGIE,That's what I'm not supposed to say.
152578,L126082,u4420,m293,PETER,Who said?
152579,L126081,u4421,m293,REGGIE,He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
152580,L126080,u4420,m293,PETER,I don't think I follow you.
152581,L126079,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
152582,L126078,u4420,m293,PETER,You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
152583,L126077,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Having a nervous breakdown.
152584,L126076,u4420,m293,PETER,What are you doing in here?
152585,L126045,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Lay on, MacDuff."
152586,L126044,u4420,m293,PETER,En garde.
152587,L126042,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!"
152588,L126041,u4420,m293,PETER,You mean you and me?
152589,L126040,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
152590,L126039,u4420,m293,PETER,What was all that?
152591,L126037,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Starting tonight?
152592,L126036,u4420,m293,PETER,"Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?"
152593,L126033,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?"
152594,L126032,u4420,m293,PETER,Of course? I thought he was dead.
152595,L126022,u4421,m293,REGGIE,The man and the woman are married --
152596,L126021,u4420,m293,PETER,I'm still having trouble with English.
152597,L126020,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Don't you understand French?
152598,L126019,u4420,m293,PETER,What's going on?
152599,L126018,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
152600,L126017,u4420,m293,PETER,You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
152601,L126016,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Hallo, Peter."
152602,L125903,u4420,m293,PETER,Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
152603,L125902,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
152604,L125901,u4420,m293,PETER,We'll find you a hotel.
152605,L125900,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't know where to go.
152606,L125899,u4420,m293,PETER,Come on. You can't stay here.
152607,L125898,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
152608,L125897,u4420,m293,PETER,Instant divorce you mean?
152609,L125896,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him."
152610,L125895,u4420,m293,PETER,Doing what?
152611,L125894,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose."
152612,L125893,u4420,m293,PETER,Do you know what you're going to do?
152613,L125892,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Charles sold it all -- at auction.
152614,L125891,u4420,m293,PETER,Where did everything go?
152615,L125889,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
152616,L125888,u4420,m293,PETER,I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
152617,L125887,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Thank you.
152618,L125886,u4420,m293,PETER,It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
152619,L125885,u4421,m293,REGGIE,How did you find out?
152620,L125884,u4420,m293,PETER,I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
152621,L125883,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What are you doing here?
152622,L125822,u4420,m293,PETER,Is there only one Charles Lampert?
152623,L125821,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Charles is.
152624,L125820,u4420,m293,PETER,Are you in the book?
152625,L125819,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?"
152626,L125818,u4420,m293,PETER,It's terrible -- you just made it up.
152627,L125817,u4421,m293,REGGIE,How do you know?
152628,L125816,u4420,m293,PETER,Shakespeare never said that.
152629,L125815,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: ""When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again""?"
152630,L125814,u4420,m293,PETER,"No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today."
152631,L125813,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Now you're angry.
152632,L125812,u4420,m293,PETER,"Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you."
152633,L125811,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?"
152634,L125810,u4420,m293,PETER,Is your husband with you?
152635,L125809,u4421,m293,REGGIE,That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
152636,L125808,u4420,m293,PETER,"Yes, but we're divorced."
152637,L125807,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
152638,L125806,u4420,m293,PETER,Oh. I guess.
152639,L125805,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is."
152640,L125804,u4420,m293,PETER,I'm not sure I --
152641,L125803,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore."
152642,L125802,u4420,m293,PETER,"Well, you're honest, anyway."
152643,L125801,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No, you see, I don't really love him."
152644,L125800,u4420,m293,PETER,"Please, not on my account."
152645,L125799,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce."
152646,L125798,u4420,m293,PETER,Good for you.
152647,L125797,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Yes.
152648,L125796,u4420,m293,PETER,Is there a Mr. Lampert?
152649,L125795,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm Regina Lampert.
152650,L125794,u4420,m293,PETER,Peter Joshua.
152651,L125793,u4421,m293,REGGIE,The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
152652,L125792,u4420,m293,PETER,Sorry. Which view would you like?
152653,L125791,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
152654,L125790,u4420,m293,PETER,Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
152655,L125788,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"You give up awfully easy, don't you?"
152656,L125787,u4420,m293,PETER,How's that?
152657,L125786,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Quitter.
152658,L125785,u4420,m293,PETER,"Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list"
152659,L125784,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
152660,L125783,u4420,m293,PETER,I don't know -- how would I know?
152661,L125782,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"Why, do you think we're going to?"
152662,L125781,u4420,m293,PETER,"He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?"
152663,L125780,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?"
152664,L125779,u4420,m293,PETER,"Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?"
152665,L126407,u4425,m293,TEX,"Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?"
152666,L126406,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Can you give me one good reason why I should?
152667,L126074,u4425,m293,TEX,"You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?"
152668,L126073,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Please stop -- please!
152669,L126072,u4425,m293,TEX,"It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?"
152670,L126070,u4425,m293,TEX,"Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --"
152671,L126069,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Stop that!
152672,L126066,u4425,m293,TEX,"Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!"
152673,L126065,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"No -- no, I'm don't."
152674,L126064,u4425,m293,TEX,"You know what I want, Miz Lampert..."
152675,L126063,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Wha -- what do you want?
152676,L126062,u4425,m293,TEX,"Howdy, Miz Lampert."
152677,L125921,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't understa--
152678,L125920,u4425,m293,TEX,Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
152679,L125919,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Yes?
152680,L125918,u4425,m293,TEX,"Miz Lampert, ma'am..."
152681,L126781,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,We will separate -- you look over there.
152682,L126780,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't see him.
152683,L126779,u4421,m293,REGGIE,A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
152684,L126778,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,What?
152685,L126777,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
152686,L126776,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,"What's the matter, chrie?"
152687,L126775,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
152688,L126774,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,"The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --"
152689,L126773,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I'm glad. But what's all this?
152690,L126772,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
152691,L126771,u4421,m293,REGGIE,What's he up to?
152692,L126770,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,"Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis."
152693,L126769,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
152694,L126725,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,Oh la vache!
152695,L126724,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
152696,L126723,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
152697,L126722,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
152698,L125927,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
152699,L125926,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,What is it about?
152700,L125925,u4421,m293,REGGIE,The American Embassy.
152701,L125924,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,Who is it from?
152702,L125915,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,He's allergic to him.
152703,L125914,u4421,m293,REGGIE,How can you tell?
152704,L125913,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,He must have known Charles pretty well.
152705,L125912,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I've never seen him before.
152706,L125911,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,Do you know him?
152707,L125910,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
152708,L125909,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,Have you no idea who could have done it?
152709,L125908,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
152710,L125907,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
152711,L125906,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,Didn't Charles have any friends?
152712,L125905,u4421,m293,REGGIE,It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
152713,L125827,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Don't you want me to stay?
152714,L125826,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,He knows everything.
152715,L125777,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,"
152716,L125776,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
152717,L125775,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,But that is no reason to get a divorce!
152718,L125774,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Because I don't love him.
152719,L125773,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,But why do you want a divorce?
152720,L125771,u4421,m293,REGGIE,I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
152721,L125770,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,But what?
152722,L125769,u4421,m293,REGGIE,"He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --"
152723,L125768,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,a alors! From Charles?
152724,L125767,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
152725,L125765,u4424,m293,SYLVIE,"Va jouer, mon ange."
152726,L125764,u4421,m293,REGGIE,Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
152727,L126432,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,We want that money -- now!
152728,L126431,u4425,m293,TEX,"This ain't no game, Miz Lampert."
152729,L126425,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,Who invited you?
152730,L126424,u4425,m293,TEX,"Howdy, Miz Lampert."
152731,L126146,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,"Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!"
152732,L126145,u4425,m293,TEX,"Shoot no, not after all these years."
152733,L126140,u4425,m293,TEX,He took care of Charlie for us.
152734,L126139,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,Yeah? What's that?
152735,L126138,u4425,m293,TEX,"Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor."
152736,L126137,u4423,m293,SCOBIE,"We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!"
152737,L127158,u4436,m294,KILLER,Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
152738,L127157,u4426,m294,ANNETTE,You do?
152739,L127156,u4436,m294,KILLER,I think I know how to restore your reputation.
152740,L127155,u4426,m294,ANNETTE,"He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating."
152741,L127154,u4436,m294,KILLER,He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
152742,L127153,u4426,m294,ANNETTE,Why?
152743,L127152,u4436,m294,KILLER,I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
152744,L127151,u4426,m294,ANNETTE,Yeah?
152745,L127582,u4427,m294,BEN,Ok!
152746,L127581,u4430,m294,CINDY,I get the imports.
152747,L127580,u4427,m294,BEN,One more time.
152748,L127542,u4430,m294,CINDY,Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
152749,L127541,u4427,m294,BEN,That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
152750,L127540,u4430,m294,CINDY,Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
152751,L127539,u4427,m294,BEN,Not my imports.
152752,L127538,u4430,m294,CINDY,I get all your CDs.
152753,L127263,u4430,m294,CINDY,Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
152754,L127262,u4427,m294,BEN,WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
152755,L127261,u4430,m294,CINDY,ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
152756,L127260,u4427,m294,BEN,You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
152757,L127259,u4430,m294,CINDY,I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
152758,L127120,u4427,m294,BEN,Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
152759,L127119,u4430,m294,CINDY,I think it's funny.
152760,L127108,u4427,m294,BEN,As fucking if.
152761,L127107,u4430,m294,CINDY,"If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?"
152762,L127106,u4427,m294,BEN,Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
152763,L127105,u4430,m294,CINDY,I never fucked Rod.
152764,L127104,u4427,m294,BEN,What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
152765,L127103,u4430,m294,CINDY,I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
152766,L127102,u4427,m294,BEN,Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
152767,L127288,u4448,m294,TOM,Calm down Brent.
152768,L127287,u4428,m294,BRENT,I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
152769,L127286,u4448,m294,TOM,That's impossible.
152770,L127285,u4428,m294,BRENT,IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
152771,L127201,u4428,m294,BRENT,Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
152772,L127200,u4448,m294,TOM,You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
152773,L127199,u4428,m294,BRENT,I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
152774,L127198,u4448,m294,TOM,"Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday."
152775,L127197,u4428,m294,BRENT,is there anything you do?
152776,L127196,u4448,m294,TOM,"Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?"
152777,L127195,u4428,m294,BRENT,If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
152778,L127076,u4448,m294,TOM,Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
152779,L127075,u4428,m294,BRENT,So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
152780,L127074,u4448,m294,TOM,So?
152781,L127073,u4428,m294,BRENT,"She's my daughter, Tom."
152782,L127072,u4448,m294,TOM,The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
152783,L127071,u4428,m294,BRENT,Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
152784,L127061,u4428,m294,BRENT,I just wanted to check that you were okay?
152785,L127060,u4448,m294,TOM,Hi Jody.
152786,L127057,u4448,m294,TOM,"Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is."
152787,L127056,u4428,m294,BRENT,But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
152788,L127055,u4448,m294,TOM,Good.
152789,L127054,u4428,m294,BRENT,No.
152790,L127053,u4448,m294,TOM,"You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?"
152791,L127615,u4428,m294,BRENT,Run!
152792,L127614,u4434,m294,JODY,No!
152793,L127294,u4428,m294,BRENT,Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
152794,L127293,u4434,m294,JODY,Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
152795,L127292,u4428,m294,BRENT,What did you hear?
152796,L127291,u4434,m294,JODY,No I wasn't.
152797,L127290,u4428,m294,BRENT,You were eavesdropping.
152798,L127284,u4428,m294,BRENT,Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
152799,L127283,u4434,m294,JODY,Who is she Daddy?
152800,L127282,u4428,m294,BRENT,It can't be.
152801,L127281,u4434,m294,JODY,You know her?
152802,L127249,u4434,m294,JODY,She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
152803,L127248,u4428,m294,BRENT,Are you sure?
152804,L127247,u4434,m294,JODY,It was a she.
152805,L127190,u4428,m294,BRENT,I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
152806,L127189,u4434,m294,JODY,I thought you'd be pleased.
152807,L127188,u4428,m294,BRENT,I'm not.
152808,L127187,u4434,m294,JODY,You are upset.
152809,L127186,u4428,m294,BRENT,No honey.
152810,L127185,u4434,m294,JODY,"Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!"
152811,L127184,u4428,m294,BRENT,Ok.
152812,L127182,u4428,m294,BRENT,"You never went, uh, all the way?"
152813,L127181,u4434,m294,JODY,Not much further.
152814,L127180,u4428,m294,BRENT,I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
152815,L127179,u4434,m294,JODY,Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
152816,L127178,u4428,m294,BRENT,How much further?
152817,L127177,u4434,m294,JODY,A little.
152818,L127176,u4428,m294,BRENT,I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
152819,L127175,u4434,m294,JODY,Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
152820,L127174,u4428,m294,BRENT,"Well, I assume you let him kiss you?"
152821,L127173,u4434,m294,JODY,What do you mean?
152822,L127170,u4428,m294,BRENT,I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
152823,L127169,u4434,m294,JODY,What's wrong?
152824,L127168,u4428,m294,BRENT,Hi honey.
152825,L127068,u4434,m294,JODY,I will. Is that all?
152826,L127067,u4428,m294,BRENT,I want you to head right home after school.
152827,L127066,u4434,m294,JODY,"No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now."
152828,L127065,u4428,m294,BRENT,Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
152829,L127064,u4434,m294,JODY,I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
152830,L127063,u4428,m294,BRENT,How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
152831,L127062,u4434,m294,JODY,I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
152832,L127059,u4434,m294,JODY,Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
152833,L127058,u4428,m294,BRENT,Hi honey.
152834,L127032,u4428,m294,BRENT,They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
152835,L127031,u4434,m294,JODY,Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
152836,L127030,u4428,m294,BRENT,You said that two weeks ago.
152837,L127029,u4434,m294,JODY,It won't happen again.
152838,L127028,u4428,m294,BRENT,"Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss."
152839,L127027,u4434,m294,JODY,What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
152840,L127026,u4428,m294,BRENT,You're grounded Friday night!
152841,L127025,u4434,m294,JODY,Daddy you scared me!
152842,L127024,u4428,m294,BRENT,It's almost ten o'clock.
152843,L127404,u4428,m294,BRENT,"I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours."
152844,L127403,u4432,m294,DEPUTY,We're seeing all the signs in town.
152845,L127402,u4428,m294,BRENT,Are you sure?
152846,L127401,u4432,m294,DEPUTY,Should we close down any eruption?
152847,L127400,u4428,m294,BRENT,No?
152848,L127399,u4432,m294,DEPUTY,"As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight."
152849,L127392,u4428,m294,BRENT,No. I'll handle this.
152850,L127391,u4432,m294,DEPUTY,We need you here. I can bring her in.
152851,L127390,u4428,m294,BRENT,There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
152852,L127389,u4432,m294,DEPUTY,You found her?
152853,L127041,u4432,m294,DEPUTY,The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
152854,L127040,u4428,m294,BRENT,"What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?"
152855,L127252,u4428,m294,BRENT,She's underage.
152856,L127251,u4438,m294,MARGE,This will relax her.
152857,L127250,u4428,m294,BRENT,What are you doing?
152858,L127194,u4428,m294,BRENT,No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
152859,L127193,u4438,m294,MARGE,Did you warn her?
152860,L127192,u4428,m294,BRENT,She's still a virgin.
152861,L127191,u4438,m294,MARGE,Well?
152862,L127166,u4438,m294,MARGE,She just turned off her light.
152863,L127165,u4428,m294,BRENT,Is Jody still awake?
152864,L127038,u4428,m294,BRENT,Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
152865,L127037,u4438,m294,MARGE,What happened?
152866,L127491,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
152867,L127490,u4428,m294,BRENT,Why?
152868,L127489,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,Yeah. You should check downstairs.
152869,L127488,u4428,m294,BRENT,Really?
152870,L127487,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
152871,L127486,u4428,m294,BRENT,"No, you couldn't."
152872,L127485,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,"Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?"
152873,L127484,u4428,m294,BRENT,No.
152874,L127483,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
152875,L127482,u4428,m294,BRENT,Is there a picture of her somewhere?
152876,L127479,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,"I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant."
152877,L127478,u4428,m294,BRENT,I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
152878,L127477,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,I can.
152879,L127476,u4428,m294,BRENT,Can you get inside?
152880,L127475,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
152881,L127474,u4428,m294,BRENT,Can you describe her? How old was she?
152882,L127473,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
152883,L127472,u4428,m294,BRENT,She was murdered?
152884,L127471,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,A bullet to the right cerebellum.
152885,L127470,u4428,m294,BRENT,Of what?
152886,L127469,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,She resides there. Out back. She died a year and a half ago.
152887,L127468,u4428,m294,BRENT,She works at a church?
152888,L127467,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,St. Michael's.
152889,L127466,u4428,m294,BRENT,You know where I can find her?
152890,L127465,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,She's not here.
152891,L127464,u4428,m294,BRENT,I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
152892,L127463,u4429,m294,CARETAKER,Hello?
152893,L127525,u4431,m294,DAD,No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
152894,L127524,u4445,m294,SANDY,You're not?
152895,L127523,u4431,m294,DAD,Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
152896,L127522,u4445,m294,SANDY,Daddy....
152897,L127521,u4431,m294,DAD,Your brother told us.
152898,L127520,u4445,m294,SANDY,
152899,L127519,u4431,m294,DAD,I know where you're going.
152900,L127633,u4432,m294,DEPUTY,"No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen."
152901,L127632,u4443,m294,POLICEMAN,But I shouldn't shut it down?
152902,L127630,u4443,m294,POLICEMAN,Ok.
152903,L127629,u4432,m294,DEPUTY,Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
152904,L127628,u4443,m294,POLICEMAN,Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
152905,L127627,u4432,m294,DEPUTY,Jesus. Any word from Brent?
152906,L127626,u4443,m294,POLICEMAN,"Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder."
152907,L127625,u4432,m294,DEPUTY,Who's?
152908,L127624,u4443,m294,POLICEMAN,We just found another body.
152909,L127665,u4433,m294,JIMMY,"I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon."
152910,L127664,u4437,m294,LEONARD,Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
152911,L127662,u4433,m294,JIMMY,I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
152912,L127661,u4437,m294,LEONARD,I'm sure you should have failed.
152913,L127660,u4433,m294,JIMMY,You gave me a 'D'.
152914,L127659,u4437,m294,LEONARD,What?
152915,L127658,u4433,m294,JIMMY,You fucked me up!
152916,L127655,u4433,m294,JIMMY,What are you doing here?
152917,L127654,u4437,m294,LEONARD,Pay no attention to me.
152918,L127675,u4437,m294,LEONARD,You think you're my sister?
152919,L127674,u4434,m294,JODY,"Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?"
152920,L127573,u4437,m294,LEONARD,Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
152921,L127572,u4434,m294,JODY,You're the killed.
152922,L127571,u4437,m294,LEONARD,I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
152923,L127570,u4434,m294,JODY,Yes.
152924,L127569,u4437,m294,LEONARD,Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
152925,L127568,u4434,m294,JODY,_ Your father raped someone?
152926,L127567,u4437,m294,LEONARD,He's a rapist. Like mine.
152927,L127566,u4434,m294,JODY,What do you know about my father?
152928,L127565,u4437,m294,LEONARD,Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
152929,L127564,u4434,m294,JODY,Me? Why me?
152930,L127563,u4437,m294,LEONARD,Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
152931,L127562,u4434,m294,JODY,Really?
152932,L127561,u4437,m294,LEONARD,We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
152933,L127559,u4437,m294,LEONARD,I really do. For your own safety.
152934,L127558,u4434,m294,JODY,"You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?"
152935,L127557,u4437,m294,LEONARD,Then you should go.
152936,L127556,u4434,m294,JODY,Of course I'm scared.
152937,L127555,u4437,m294,LEONARD,of COURSE. You're not scared?
152938,L127554,u4434,m294,JODY,You know about that too?
152939,L127553,u4437,m294,LEONARD,You aren't going to the party?
152940,L127552,u4434,m294,JODY,Sure.
152941,L127551,u4437,m294,LEONARD,Can you just follow me? The back is full?
152942,L127550,u4434,m294,JODY,Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
152943,L127549,u4437,m294,LEONARD,My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
152944,L127548,u4434,m294,JODY,I am.
152945,L127315,u4445,m294,SANDY,"Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety."
152946,L127314,u4434,m294,JODY,I can't right now.
152947,L127313,u4445,m294,SANDY,Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
152948,L127312,u4434,m294,JODY,Stag?
152949,L127311,u4445,m294,SANDY,"I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go."
152950,L127310,u4434,m294,JODY,Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
152951,L127309,u4445,m294,SANDY,Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
152952,L127308,u4434,m294,JODY,You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
152953,L127307,u4445,m294,SANDY,It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
152954,L127306,u4434,m294,JODY,I won't.
152955,L127305,u4445,m294,SANDY,Especially not your dad.
152956,L127304,u4434,m294,JODY,Ok.
152957,L127303,u4445,m294,SANDY,You can't tell your parents.
152958,L127302,u4434,m294,JODY,No.
152959,L127301,u4445,m294,SANDY,Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
152960,L127300,u4434,m294,JODY,What party?
152961,L127299,u4445,m294,SANDY,Mark invited me to the party.
152962,L127298,u4434,m294,JODY,What?
152963,L127297,u4445,m294,SANDY,Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
152964,L127296,u4434,m294,JODY,FINE. Are you?
152965,L127295,u4445,m294,SANDY,You ok?
152966,L127255,u4445,m294,SANDY,The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
152967,L127254,u4434,m294,JODY,Someone tried to kill me.
152968,L127230,u4434,m294,JODY,NO?!
152969,L127229,u4445,m294,SANDY,You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
152970,L127228,u4434,m294,JODY,Not that many.
152971,L127227,u4445,m294,SANDY,There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
152972,L127226,u4434,m294,JODY,"Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us."
152973,L127149,u4445,m294,SANDY,OK. increase the peace.
152974,L127148,u4434,m294,JODY,I promised I'd go right home after school.
152975,L127147,u4445,m294,SANDY,I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
152976,L127146,u4434,m294,JODY,How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
152977,L127145,u4445,m294,SANDY,"Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . ."
152978,L127144,u4434,m294,JODY,I don't know what I'm so scared of.
152979,L127143,u4445,m294,SANDY,That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best friend.
152980,L127142,u4434,m294,JODY,You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
152981,L127141,u4445,m294,SANDY,No!
152982,L127140,u4434,m294,JODY,Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
152983,L127139,u4445,m294,SANDY,"Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me."
152984,L127138,u4434,m294,JODY,He says he loves me.
152985,L127137,u4445,m294,SANDY,Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
152986,L127136,u4434,m294,JODY,I was desperate. It was gross.
152987,L127135,u4445,m294,SANDY,Oh nice save.
152988,L127131,u4445,m294,SANDY,I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
152989,L127130,u4434,m294,JODY,Does she fuck?
152990,L127129,u4445,m294,SANDY,He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
152991,L127128,u4434,m294,JODY,But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
152992,L127127,u4445,m294,SANDY,You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
152993,L127126,u4434,m294,JODY,You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
152994,L127125,u4445,m294,SANDY,You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
152995,L127124,u4434,m294,JODY,You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
152996,L127123,u4445,m294,SANDY,What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
152997,L127095,u4434,m294,JODY,You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
152998,L127094,u4445,m294,SANDY,No! That's his table.
152999,L127092,u4445,m294,SANDY,Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
153000,L127091,u4434,m294,JODY,You eventually have to talk to him.
153001,L127090,u4445,m294,SANDY,"The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too."
153002,L127089,u4434,m294,JODY,"You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents."
153003,L127088,u4445,m294,SANDY,I don't watch him eat everyday.
153004,L127087,u4434,m294,JODY,Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
153005,L127086,u4445,m294,SANDY,Why?
153006,L127085,u4434,m294,JODY,Mark Shale.
153007,L127084,u4445,m294,SANDY,Who?
153008,L127083,u4434,m294,JODY,Go sit next to him.
153009,L127419,u4440,m294,MISS DUNLOP,You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
153010,L127418,u4434,m294,JODY,No.
153011,L127417,u4440,m294,MISS DUNLOP,Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
153012,L127416,u4434,m294,JODY,You Miss Dunlop?
153013,L127415,u4440,m294,MISS DUNLOP,"Not at all. In fact, I thought about going."
153014,L127414,u4434,m294,JODY,Don't you think it's sick?
153015,L127413,u4440,m294,MISS DUNLOP,Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
153016,L127412,u4434,m294,JODY,You heard about that?
153017,L127411,u4440,m294,MISS DUNLOP,Everyone's getting ready for the party.
153018,L127410,u4434,m294,JODY,This place is empty.
153019,L127409,u4440,m294,MISS DUNLOP,Follow me.
153020,L127408,u4434,m294,JODY,Twenty eight years ago.
153021,L127407,u4440,m294,MISS DUNLOP,They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
153022,L127406,u4434,m294,JODY,Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
153023,L127405,u4440,m294,MISS DUNLOP,Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
153024,L127648,u4435,m294,KENNY,Pretend we're just another couple.
153025,L127647,u4434,m294,JODY,What are you doing?
153026,L127644,u4435,m294,KENNY,Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
153027,L127643,u4434,m294,JODY,Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
153028,L127635,u4435,m294,KENNY,I love you.
153029,L127634,u4434,m294,JODY,Thanks for coming back for me.
153030,L127621,u4435,m294,KENNY,Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
153031,L127620,u4434,m294,JODY,Go to the police station!
153032,L127617,u4435,m294,KENNY,He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
153033,L127616,u4434,m294,JODY,My dad's down there!
153034,L127518,u4434,m294,JODY,"Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore."
153035,L127517,u4435,m294,KENNY,I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
153036,L127516,u4434,m294,JODY,What?
153037,L127515,u4435,m294,KENNY,Jody. Wait.
153038,L127514,u4434,m294,JODY,This party is sick.
153039,L127513,u4435,m294,KENNY,"Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party."
153040,L127512,u4435,m294,KENNY,"Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me."
153041,L127511,u4434,m294,JODY,"And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat."
153042,L127510,u4435,m294,KENNY,Sharon's far from a slut.
153043,L127509,u4434,m294,JODY,You flaunt some slut in my face.
153044,L127508,u4435,m294,KENNY,That's not why we broke up.
153045,L127507,u4434,m294,JODY,You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
153046,L127506,u4435,m294,KENNY,Yeah.
153047,L127505,u4434,m294,JODY,I'm making you feel like meat?
153048,L127504,u4435,m294,KENNY,Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
153049,L127503,u4434,m294,JODY,What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
153050,L127501,u4434,m294,JODY,"Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now."
153051,L127500,u4435,m294,KENNY,Are you coming to the party?
153052,L127499,u4435,m294,KENNY,I don't know. I kind of am.
153053,L127498,u4434,m294,JODY,So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
153054,L127497,u4435,m294,KENNY,"But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody."
153055,L127496,u4434,m294,JODY,I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
153056,L127495,u4435,m294,KENNY,I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
153057,L127494,u4434,m294,JODY,My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
153058,L127493,u4435,m294,KENNY,All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
153059,L127363,u4435,m294,KENNY,Yes!
153060,L127362,u4434,m294,JODY,I'll think about it.
153061,L127361,u4435,m294,KENNY,They're not picking me up until six.
153062,L127360,u4434,m294,JODY,I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
153063,L127359,u4435,m294,KENNY,"I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together."
153064,L127358,u4434,m294,JODY,I do not.
153065,L127357,u4435,m294,KENNY,Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
153066,L127356,u4434,m294,JODY,I'm not using him as an excuse.
153067,L127355,u4435,m294,KENNY,"If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it."
153068,L127354,u4434,m294,JODY,"No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me."
153069,L127353,u4435,m294,KENNY,Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
153070,L127352,u4434,m294,JODY,I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
153071,L127351,u4435,m294,KENNY,You know I want to go with you.
153072,L127350,u4434,m294,JODY,Did Sharon say no?
153073,L127349,u4435,m294,KENNY,Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
153074,L127348,u4434,m294,JODY,Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
153075,L127347,u4435,m294,KENNY,Why?
153076,L127346,u4434,m294,JODY,Yeah. I think it's really sick.
153077,L127345,u4435,m294,KENNY,I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
153078,L127344,u4434,m294,JODY,I did.
153079,L127343,u4435,m294,KENNY,I heard you got attacked.
153080,L127342,u4434,m294,JODY,I'm fine.
153081,L127341,u4435,m294,KENNY,Are you O.K.?
153082,L127023,u4435,m294,KENNY,"Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience."
153083,L127022,u4434,m294,JODY,What?
153084,L127021,u4435,m294,KENNY,"You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people."
153085,L127019,u4435,m294,KENNY,Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
153086,L127018,u4434,m294,JODY,I got to get home.
153087,L127017,u4435,m294,KENNY,So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
153088,L127016,u4434,m294,JODY,I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
153089,L127015,u4435,m294,KENNY,Why?
153090,L127014,u4434,m294,JODY,Cut it out.
153091,L127461,u4434,m294,JODY,NO!
153092,L127460,u4438,m294,MARGE,Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
153093,L127459,u4434,m294,JODY,THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
153094,L127456,u4434,m294,JODY,Who was the fourth?
153095,L127455,u4438,m294,MARGE,Yes.
153096,L127454,u4434,m294,JODY,The principal?
153097,L127453,u4438,m294,MARGE,Mr. Sisler was one of them.
153098,L127452,u4434,m294,JODY,You're not telling me something.
153099,L127451,u4438,m294,MARGE,Two men left town right after it happened.
153100,L127450,u4434,m294,JODY,The men. Do any of them still live around here?
153101,L127449,u4438,m294,MARGE,Who?
153102,L127448,u4434,m294,JODY,Who were they?
153103,L127447,u4438,m294,MARGE,I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
153104,L127446,u4434,m294,JODY,The word is Mob.
153105,L127445,u4438,m294,MARGE,I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
153106,L127444,u4434,m294,JODY,How could you?
153107,L127443,u4438,m294,MARGE,EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
153108,L127442,u4434,m294,JODY,And the police did nothing?
153109,L127441,u4438,m294,MARGE,They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
153110,L127440,u4434,m294,JODY,People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
153111,L127439,u4438,m294,MARGE,"They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'."
153112,L127438,u4434,m294,JODY,Why not?
153113,L127437,u4438,m294,MARGE,"No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged."
153114,L127436,u4434,m294,JODY,You didn't believe her?
153115,L127435,u4438,m294,MARGE,She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
153116,L127434,u4434,m294,JODY,Attacked how?
153117,L127433,u4438,m294,MARGE,"Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors."
153118,L127432,u4434,m294,JODY,I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
153119,L127431,u4438,m294,MARGE,What?
153120,L127430,u4434,m294,JODY,Wait.
153121,L127427,u4438,m294,MARGE,Don't make me order you.
153122,L127426,u4434,m294,JODY,"Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me."
153123,L127425,u4438,m294,MARGE,She's nobody you should be concerned with.
153124,L127424,u4434,m294,JODY,Who is she?
153125,L127423,u4438,m294,MARGE,"I want you to come home with me right now, Jody."
153126,L127387,u4434,m294,JODY,The library. I'll be fine.
153127,L127386,u4438,m294,MARGE,Where are you going?
153128,L127385,u4438,m294,MARGE,Not that I know of.
153129,L127384,u4434,m294,JODY,No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
153130,L127383,u4438,m294,MARGE,I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
153131,L127382,u4434,m294,JODY,No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
153132,L127381,u4438,m294,MARGE,Did he say anything else about her?
153133,L127380,u4434,m294,JODY,That's what he said.
153134,L127379,u4438,m294,MARGE,What?
153135,L127378,u4434,m294,JODY,I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
153136,L127377,u4438,m294,MARGE,I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
153137,L127376,u4434,m294,JODY,Yeah. Who is she?
153138,L127375,u4438,m294,MARGE,Lisa Sherman?
153139,L127374,u4434,m294,JODY,Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
153140,L127373,u4438,m294,MARGE,You can ask me anything.
153141,L127372,u4434,m294,JODY,I need to ask you something.
153142,L127371,u4438,m294,MARGE,Yes?
153143,L127370,u4434,m294,JODY,Mom?
153144,L127369,u4438,m294,MARGE,Hi princess.
153145,L127368,u4434,m294,JODY,Hi mom.
153146,L127245,u4434,m294,JODY,His mother's an only child.
153147,L127244,u4436,m294,KILLER,His mother's side.
153148,L127243,u4434,m294,JODY,On what side of the family?

153469,L128881,u4460,m295,MASON,
153470,L128876,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here."
153471,L128875,u4460,m295,MASON,
153472,L128874,u4449,m295,ARLO,...miles.

153474,L128872,u4460,m295,MASON,...split.
153475,L128871,u4460,m295,MASON,"Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can..."
153476,L128870,u4449,m295,ARLO,...shit.
153477,L128869,u4449,m295,ARLO,...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
153478,L128868,u4449,m295,ARLO,...-er.  It was your friend...
153479,L128867,u4449,m295,ARLO,"...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ..."
153480,L128866,u4449,m295,ARLO,"I mean, if that gun was..."
153481,L128865,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Not completely, anyway."
153482,L128864,u4449,m295,ARLO,"To tell you the truth, you didn't."
153483,L128863,u4460,m295,MASON,...shit.
153484,L128862,u4460,m295,MASON,"...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this..."
153485,L128861,u4460,m295,MASON,"Listen, Arlo..."
153486,L128824,u4449,m295,ARLO,
153487,L128823,u4460,m295,MASON,We got two paddles.
153488,L128822,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle."
153489,L128821,u4460,m295,MASON,"Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene."
153490,L128820,u4460,m295,MASON,And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
153491,L128819,u4460,m295,MASON,Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
153492,L128818,u4460,m295,MASON,Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
153493,L128817,u4460,m295,MASON,...hospital.
153494,L128816,u4460,m295,MASON,And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
153495,L128815,u4460,m295,MASON,"We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'."
153496,L128814,u4449,m295,ARLO,I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
153497,L128813,u4460,m295,MASON,"Yeah, Robert Del Rio."
153498,L128812,u4449,m295,ARLO,Robert Del Rio?
153499,L128811,u4460,m295,MASON,"Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round."
153500,L128810,u4449,m295,ARLO,How wonderful for you.
153501,L128809,u4460,m295,MASON,We were nationally  ranked.
153502,L128808,u4460,m295,MASON,"You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State."
153503,L128786,u4449,m295,ARLO,You know.
153504,L128785,u4460,m295,MASON,Yeah.
153505,L128784,u4449,m295,ARLO,"So I took his truck, yeah."
153506,L128783,u4460,m295,MASON,...truck.
153507,L128782,u4460,m295,MASON,So you took his...
153508,L128781,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split."
153509,L128780,u4449,m295,ARLO,...overdrawn bank accounts.
153510,L128779,u4449,m295,ARLO,"...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans..."
153511,L128778,u4449,m295,ARLO,...or nephew or some good old boy...
153512,L128777,u4449,m295,ARLO,"...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin..."
153513,L128776,u4449,m295,ARLO,"And he swore, he swore once I got a degree..."
153514,L128775,u4449,m295,ARLO,"I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard."
153515,L128774,u4449,m295,ARLO,You know what I'm sayin'?
153516,L128773,u4460,m295,MASON,It won't even start half the time.
153517,L128772,u4449,m295,ARLO,...piece of shit was worth.
153518,L128771,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled..."
153519,L128770,u4460,m295,MASON,...stole the truck.
153520,L128769,u4460,m295,MASON,"Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You..."
153521,L128768,u4449,m295,ARLO,...-tion?
153522,L128767,u4449,m295,ARLO,"See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-..."
153523,L128766,u4460,m295,MASON,"You're fucked, man."
153524,L128765,u4449,m295,ARLO,...did you?
153525,L128764,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out..."
153526,L128763,u4460,m295,MASON,
153527,L128762,u4449,m295,ARLO,Worth a try.
153528,L128761,u4449,m295,ARLO,Okay.
153529,L128760,u4460,m295,MASON,This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
153530,L128759,u4449,m295,ARLO,This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
153531,L128758,u4460,m295,MASON,What?
153532,L128757,u4449,m295,ARLO,Uh-oh.
153533,L128748,u4449,m295,ARLO,Whoo-hoo-hoo!

153554,L128714,u4449,m295,ARLO,What?
153555,L128713,u4460,m295,MASON,I don't want you to come anyway.
153556,L128707,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on."
153557,L128706,u4460,m295,MASON,...here!

153562,L128701,u4460,m295,MASON,Taking it down the hill.
153563,L128700,u4460,m295,MASON,
153564,L128695,u4460,m295,MASON,I'm crazy?
153565,L128694,u4449,m295,ARLO,He's crazy!

153871,L128069,u4449,m295,ARLO,"That'll make up the difference, huh?"
153872,L128068,u4449,m295,ARLO,"...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain."
153873,L128067,u4449,m295,ARLO,"...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love..."

153879,L128061,u4449,m295,ARLO,Except for the fact that I need cash.
153880,L128060,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Uh, huh?"
153881,L128059,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'."

153885,L128055,u4449,m295,ARLO,
153886,L128054,u4460,m295,MASON,"Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move."
153887,L128053,u4460,m295,MASON,

153892,L128048,u4460,m295,MASON,"Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?"
153893,L128047,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick."
153894,L128046,u4460,m295,MASON,The guy's a fuckin' moron.
153895,L128045,u4449,m295,ARLO,No argument there.

153901,L127986,u4449,m295,ARLO,Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
153902,L127985,u4460,m295,MASON,Where's Sam?
153903,L127984,u4449,m295,ARLO,...-ty.

153919,L128911,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Well, well, well."
153920,L128910,u4451,m295,BRYNNER,...without compunction.
153921,L128909,u4451,m295,BRYNNER,This country trained me to kill...
153922,L128908,u4451,m295,BRYNNER,I urge you to be persuasive.
153923,L128536,u4449,m295,ARLO,"Oh, my God."
153924,L128535,u4451,m295,BRYNNER,"Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive."
153925,L128512,u4449,m295,ARLO,I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...

153939,L128185,u4451,m295,BRYNNER,"To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long."
153940,L128184,u4451,m295,BRYNNER,
153941,L128183,u4449,m295,ARLO,That was quick.

153948,L128899,u4449,m295,ARLO,"I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?"
153949,L128898,u4457,m295,ICE CREAM ANDY,"...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?"

154606,L129750,u4468,m296,BARNEY,"'Course you do, Jake."
154607,L129749,u4477,m296,GITTES,I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
154608,L129746,u4468,m296,BARNEY,"Jake, for Christ's sake."
154609,L129745,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank."
154610,L129744,u4468,m296,BARNEY,"Take it easy, Jake."
154611,L129743,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?"

154613,L129732,u4477,m296,GITTES,Look at that.
154614,L130274,u4477,m296,GITTES,The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
154615,L130273,u4469,m296,CLERK,A ruler?
154616,L130272,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, then, how about a ruler?"
154617,L130271,u4469,m296,CLERK,"Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records."
154618,L130270,u4477,m296,GITTES,Can I check one of these volumes out?
154619,L130269,u4469,m296,CLERK,If that's what it says.
154620,L130268,u4477,m296,GITTES,But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
154621,L130267,u4469,m296,CLERK,That's right.
154622,L130266,u4477,m296,GITTES,Then these are all new owners?
154623,L130265,u4469,m296,CLERK,Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
154624,L130264,u4477,m296,GITTES,How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
154625,L130261,u4469,m296,CLERK,"Row twenty-three, section C."
154626,L130260,u4477,m296,GITTES,I'll settle for L.A. County.
154627,L130730,u4477,m296,GITTES,Who do you blame for that? Her?
154628,L130729,u4470,m296,CROSS,"The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago."
154629,L130728,u4477,m296,GITTES,Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
154630,L130727,u4470,m296,CROSS,"Oh, my, yes."
154631,L130726,u4477,m296,GITTES,I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
154632,L130725,u4470,m296,CROSS,I have no idea. How much do you want?
154633,L130724,u4477,m296,GITTES,How much are you worth?
154634,L130723,u4470,m296,CROSS,Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
154635,L130722,u4477,m296,GITTES,How do you do that?
154636,L130721,u4470,m296,CROSS,"That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water."
154637,L130720,u4477,m296,GITTES,There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
154638,L130719,u4470,m296,CROSS,"No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it."
154639,L130718,u4477,m296,GITTES,And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
154640,L130717,u4470,m296,CROSS,"That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city."
154641,L130716,u4477,m296,GITTES,Haven't the faintest idea.
154642,L130715,u4470,m296,CROSS,Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
154643,L130714,u4477,m296,GITTES,...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
154644,L130712,u4477,m296,GITTES,That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
154645,L130711,u4470,m296,CROSS,What does this mean?
154646,L130710,u4470,m296,CROSS,Yes... I think I can manage...
154647,L130709,u4477,m296,GITTES,An obituary column... can you read in this light?
154648,L130708,u4470,m296,CROSS,What is it?
154649,L130707,u4477,m296,GITTES,"I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross."
154650,L130705,u4477,m296,GITTES,With her mother.
154651,L130704,u4470,m296,CROSS,Where is she?
154652,L130703,u4477,m296,GITTES,She's fine.
154653,L130702,u4470,m296,CROSS,Is she all right?
154654,L130701,u4477,m296,GITTES,I've got her.
154655,L130700,u4470,m296,CROSS,"Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?..."
154656,L130257,u4477,m296,GITTES,"We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross."
154657,L130256,u4470,m296,CROSS,Avocado groves?
154658,L130255,u4477,m296,GITTES,I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
154659,L130254,u4470,m296,CROSS,Just find the girl.
154660,L130253,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?"
154661,L130252,u4470,m296,CROSS,"I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town."
154662,L130251,u4477,m296,GITTES,How did you find out?
154663,L130250,u4470,m296,CROSS,Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
154664,L130249,u4477,m296,GITTES,"If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about."
154665,L130248,u4470,m296,CROSS,Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
154666,L130247,u4477,m296,GITTES,I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
154667,L130246,u4470,m296,CROSS,"Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can."
154668,L130245,u4477,m296,GITTES,What about her?
154669,L130244,u4470,m296,CROSS,My daughter.
154670,L130243,u4477,m296,GITTES,I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
154671,L130242,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument."
154672,L130241,u4470,m296,CROSS,"At my age, you tend to lose track..."
154673,L130240,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
154674,L130239,u4470,m296,CROSS,"Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here."
154675,L130238,u4477,m296,GITTES,When was the last time?
154676,L130237,u4470,m296,CROSS,No.
154677,L130236,u4477,m296,GITTES,"You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?"
154678,L130235,u4470,m296,CROSS,"If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him."
154679,L130234,u4477,m296,GITTES,Maybe.
154680,L130233,u4470,m296,CROSS,Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
154681,L130232,u4477,m296,GITTES,No. She's probably scared to death.
154682,L130231,u4470,m296,CROSS,Doesn't that strike you as odd?
154683,L130230,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah.
154684,L130229,u4470,m296,CROSS,"Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?"
154685,L130228,u4477,m296,GITTES,You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
154686,L130227,u4470,m296,CROSS,"Yes, his girlfriend."
154687,L130226,u4477,m296,GITTES,His girlfriend?
154688,L130225,u4470,m296,CROSS,"'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend."
154689,L130224,u4477,m296,GITTES,Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
154690,L130223,u4470,m296,CROSS,"...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?"
154691,L130222,u4470,m296,CROSS,Was he right?
154692,L130221,u4477,m296,GITTES,It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
154693,L130220,u4470,m296,CROSS,Why is that funny?
154694,L130219,u4470,m296,CROSS,"You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't."
154695,L130218,u4477,m296,GITTES,What for?
154696,L130217,u4470,m296,CROSS,Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
154697,L130216,u4477,m296,GITTES,"If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross."
154698,L130215,u4470,m296,CROSS,"Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?"
154699,L130214,u4477,m296,GITTES,"My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results."
154700,L130213,u4470,m296,CROSS,"It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?"
154701,L130212,u4477,m296,GITTES,Too bad?
154702,L130211,u4470,m296,CROSS,That's too bad.
154703,L130210,u4477,m296,GITTES,None.
154704,L130209,u4470,m296,CROSS,"Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?"
154705,L130208,u4477,m296,GITTES,Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
154706,L130207,u4470,m296,CROSS,Honest?
154707,L130206,u4477,m296,GITTES,Very.
154708,L130205,u4470,m296,CROSS,Would you call him a capable man?
154709,L130204,u4477,m296,GITTES,We worked in Chinatown together.
154710,L130203,u4470,m296,CROSS,Where from?
154711,L130202,u4477,m296,GITTES,Oh yes.
154712,L130201,u4470,m296,CROSS,Do you know him?
154713,L130200,u4477,m296,GITTES,Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
154714,L130199,u4470,m296,CROSS,Who's the investigating officer?
154715,L130198,u4477,m296,GITTES,They're calling it an accident.
154716,L130197,u4470,m296,CROSS,Tell me. What do the police say?
154717,L130196,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way."
154718,L130194,u4477,m296,GITTES,I think I gave it to her.
154719,L130193,u4470,m296,CROSS,How did she get that idea?
154720,L130192,u4477,m296,GITTES,No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
154721,L130191,u4470,m296,CROSS,"But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband."
154722,L130190,u4477,m296,GITTES,Probably.
154723,L130189,u4470,m296,CROSS,It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
154724,L130188,u4477,m296,GITTES,It doesn't hurt.
154725,L130187,u4470,m296,CROSS,"If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising."
154726,L130186,u4477,m296,GITTES,Thanks.
154727,L130185,u4470,m296,CROSS,"You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that."
154728,L130183,u4470,m296,CROSS,"What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life."
154729,L130182,u4477,m296,GITTES,Always?
154730,L130179,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that."
154731,L130178,u4470,m296,CROSS,I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
154732,L130177,u4477,m296,GITTES,Sir?
154733,L130570,u4477,m296,GITTES,Just bring your checkbook.
154734,L130569,u4471,m296,CROSS' VOICE,What are you talking about?
154735,L130568,u4477,m296,GITTES,Either that or she'll be in jail.
154736,L130567,u4471,m296,CROSS' VOICE,"Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?"
154737,L130566,u4477,m296,GITTES,At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
154738,L130565,u4471,m296,CROSS' VOICE,Of course I do. Where are you?
154739,L130564,u4477,m296,GITTES,Do you remember the figures we discussed?
154740,L130563,u4471,m296,CROSS' VOICE,You've got her? Where?
154741,L130562,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl."
154742,L130561,u4471,m296,CROSS' VOICE,Hello.
154743,L130698,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Curly, you know how long I been in business."
154744,L130697,u4472,m296,CURLY,You sure this is okay?
154745,L130696,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat."
154746,L130695,u4472,m296,CURLY,"Okay, you got yourself a boat."
154747,L130694,u4477,m296,GITTES,I'll throw that in too.
154748,L130693,u4472,m296,CURLY,Plus what I owe you?
154749,L130692,u4477,m296,GITTES,I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
154750,L130691,u4472,m296,CURLY,I don't know...
154751,L130690,u4477,m296,GITTES,Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
154752,L130689,u4472,m296,CURLY,"Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick."
154753,L130688,u4477,m296,GITTES,"How much do you owe me, Curly?"
154754,L130684,u4477,m296,GITTES,Tell her later.
154755,L130683,u4472,m296,CURLY,I'll just tell my wife.
154756,L130682,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Right now, Curly. It can't wait."
154757,L130681,u4472,m296,CURLY,"Sure, as soon as we eat."
154758,L130680,u4477,m296,GITTES,Could you drive me somewhere?
154759,L130679,u4472,m296,CURLY,Off the alley.
154760,L130678,u4477,m296,GITTES,Where's that?
154761,L130677,u4472,m296,CURLY,In the garage.
154762,L130676,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Curly, where's your car?"
154763,L130675,u4472,m296,CURLY,Sure thing.
154764,L130672,u4472,m296,CURLY,"How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is..."
154765,L130671,u4477,m296,GITTES,No thanks.
154766,L130670,u4472,m296,CURLY,"Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?"
154767,L130669,u4477,m296,GITTES,Call me Jake. How is everything?
154768,L130668,u4472,m296,CURLY,"Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes."
154769,L129667,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly."
154770,L129666,u4472,m296,CURLY,"Thanks, Mr. Gittes."
154771,L129665,u4477,m296,GITTES,What kind of guy do you think I am?
154772,L129663,u4477,m296,GITTES,Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
154773,L129662,u4472,m296,CURLY,"I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore."
154774,L129661,u4477,m296,GITTES,You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
154775,L129660,u4472,m296,CURLY,...No...
154776,L129658,u4472,m296,CURLY,Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
154777,L129657,u4477,m296,GITTES,Oh they don't?
154778,L129656,u4472,m296,CURLY,They don't kill a guy for that.
154779,L129653,u4472,m296,CURLY,I think I'll kill her.
154780,L129652,u4477,m296,GITTES,"What's that, Curly?"
154781,L129651,u4472,m296,CURLY,"Thanks. You know something, Jake?"
154782,L129650,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake."
154783,L129649,u4472,m296,CURLY,"You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay."
154784,L129648,u4477,m296,GITTES,"You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought."
154785,L129647,u4472,m296,CURLY,Ain't worth thinking about.
154786,L129646,u4477,m296,GITTES,"What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right."
154787,L129645,u4472,m296,CURLY,She's just no good.
154788,L129986,u4477,m296,GITTES,Sue the shit out of 'em.
154789,L129985,u4473,m296,DUFFY,Then what'll you do?
154790,L129782,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too."
154791,L129781,u4473,m296,DUFFY,"I said okay, Jake."
154792,L129780,u4477,m296,GITTES,That's a filthy habit.
154793,L129779,u4473,m296,DUFFY,Okay.
154794,L129778,u4477,m296,GITTES,"There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy."
154795,L129760,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy..."
154796,L129759,u4473,m296,DUFFY,"Jake, listen."
154797,L129758,u4477,m296,GITTES,So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
154798,L130375,u4477,m296,GITTES,But what?
154799,L130374,u4474,m296,EMMA,"Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -"
154800,L130373,u4477,m296,GITTES,How do they do that?
154801,L130372,u4474,m296,EMMA,No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
154802,L130371,u4477,m296,GITTES,The apple core?
154803,L130370,u4474,m296,EMMA,The apple core club.
154804,L130369,u4477,m296,GITTES,Where did you get this material?
154805,L130368,u4474,m296,EMMA,Thank you...
154806,L130367,u4477,m296,GITTES,That's just lovely.
154807,L130366,u4474,m296,EMMA,"Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it."
154808,L130365,u4477,m296,GITTES,Well you own a lot of land.
154809,L130364,u4474,m296,EMMA,I'm not.
154810,L130363,u4477,m296,GITTES,Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
154811,L130362,u4474,m296,EMMA,Why?
154812,L130361,u4477,m296,GITTES,I've been wanting to meet you.
154813,L130360,u4474,m296,EMMA,Yes.
154814,L130764,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father."
154815,L130763,u4477,m296,GITTES,Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
154816,L130762,u4477,m296,GITTES,An accident?
154817,L130761,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident."
154818,L130760,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him."
154819,L130755,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Gittes, stay outta this."
154820,L130754,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know."
154821,L130753,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray."
154822,L130752,u4477,m296,GITTES,Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
154823,L130751,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony."
154824,L130750,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later."
154825,L130749,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that."
154826,L130665,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Gee, thanks, Lou."
154827,L130664,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Give you three minutes.
154828,L130663,u4477,m296,GITTES,I guess not.
154829,L130662,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"You never learn, do you, Gittes?"
154830,L130660,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Do me a favor, will you, Lou?"
154831,L130659,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Well, let's go."
154832,L130658,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah.
154833,L130657,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,That's it?
154834,L130656,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
154835,L130655,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can."
154836,L130654,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up."
154837,L130653,u4477,m296,GITTES,What for?
154838,L130652,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"No, Gittes, you'll show us."
154839,L130651,u4477,m296,GITTES,She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
154840,L130650,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,What's the maid's address?
154841,L130649,u4477,m296,GITTES,Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
154842,L130648,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Where?
154843,L130647,u4477,m296,GITTES,Matter of fact I do.
154844,L130646,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
154845,L130544,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Shut up.  Go on.
154846,L130543,u4477,m296,GITTES,I know what he says.
154847,L130538,u4477,m296,GITTES,They only dump the water at night.
154848,L130537,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Too late for what?
154849,L130536,u4477,m296,GITTES,It's too late.
154850,L130534,u4477,m296,GITTES,C'mon I'll show you.
154851,L130533,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,What are you talking about?
154852,L130532,u4477,m296,GITTES,He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
154853,L130531,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,And why's that?
154854,L130530,u4477,m296,GITTES,Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
154855,L130529,u4477,m296,GITTES,Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
154856,L130528,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum."
154857,L130527,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou."
154858,L130526,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line."
154859,L130525,u4477,m296,GITTES,"I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar."
154860,L130524,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Absolutely.
154861,L130523,u4477,m296,GITTES,You accusing me of extortion?
154862,L130522,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
154863,L130521,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?"
154864,L130520,u4477,m296,GITTES,I heard it was an accident.
154865,L130519,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered."
154866,L130518,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah?
154867,L130517,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray."
154868,L130516,u4477,m296,GITTES,What pictures?
154869,L130515,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,I want the rest of the pictures.
154870,L130514,u4477,m296,GITTES,"I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home."
154871,L130513,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?"
154872,L130511,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,How did she...  ...happen to have them?
154873,L130510,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Yeah, I took 'em. So what?"
154874,L130506,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring."
154875,L130505,u4477,m296,GITTES,Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
154876,L130504,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Isn't that your number?
154877,L130503,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Let me show you something.
154878,L130502,u4477,m296,GITTES,I don't.
154879,L130501,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,How do you happen to know her?
154880,L130500,u4477,m296,GITTES,Didn't you call?
154881,L130499,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,What are you doing here?
154882,L129938,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"When I do, you'll hear about it."
154883,L129937,u4477,m296,GITTES,Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
154884,L129936,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know."
154885,L129933,u4477,m296,GITTES,You mean that's what you're going to call it.
154886,L129932,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,No. It was an accident.
154887,L129931,u4477,m296,GITTES,No?
154888,L129930,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,I don't want it anymore.
154889,L129918,u4477,m296,GITTES,No.
154890,L129917,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Or her name?
154891,L129916,u4477,m296,GITTES,No.
154892,L129915,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
154893,L129892,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,You're welcome to try. There he is.
154894,L129891,u4477,m296,GITTES,I'd like to talk to him.
154895,L129890,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Oh yes.
154896,L129889,u4477,m296,GITTES,Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
154897,L129888,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Who?
154898,L129887,u4477,m296,GITTES,Looking for someone.
154899,L129886,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
154900,L129885,u4477,m296,GITTES,Congratulations.
154901,L129884,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Since I made Lieutenant.
154902,L129883,u4477,m296,GITTES,Since when?
154903,L129882,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown."
154904,L129879,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have."
154905,L129878,u4477,m296,GITTES,I get by.
154906,L129877,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,You've done well by yourself.
154907,L129876,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little."
154908,L129875,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,How'd you get past the guards?
154909,L129874,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Thanks, Lou."
154910,L129871,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Yeah, they are."
154911,L129870,u4477,m296,GITTES,Summer colds are the worst.
154912,L129869,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine."
154913,L129868,u4477,m296,GITTES,"How are you, Lou?"
154914,L129867,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Hello, Jake."
154915,L129920,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch."
154916,L129919,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?"
154917,L129911,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Well yes.
154918,L129910,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Mr. Gittes.
154919,L129909,u4476,m296,EVELYN,A private investigator?
154920,L129908,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
154921,L129907,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Yes.
154922,L129906,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,A complete surprise?
154923,L129905,u4476,m296,EVELYN,He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
154924,L129904,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,You and your husband never discussed her?
154925,L129903,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Certainly not!
154926,L129902,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Do you know where she might be?
154927,L129901,u4476,m296,EVELYN,No.
154928,L129900,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,"Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?"
154929,L129899,u4476,m296,EVELYN,No.
154930,L129898,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
154931,L129897,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"...Well, it didn't make him happy..."
154932,L129895,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
154933,L129894,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Of course.
154934,L129893,u4475,m296,ESCOBAR,It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
154935,L130742,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Sure, but I'd like to handle it."
154936,L130741,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I'm all right.
154937,L130740,u4477,m296,GITTES,Let me handle that.
154938,L130634,u4476,m296,EVELYN,He didn't wear bifocals.
154939,L130633,u4477,m296,GITTES,How do you know?
154940,L130631,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Okay...
154941,L130630,u4477,m296,GITTES,On his day off. Get the exact address.
154942,L130629,u4476,m296,EVELYN,With us.
154943,L130628,u4477,m296,GITTES,...where does Kyo live?
154944,L130627,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Where can we go?
154945,L130626,u4477,m296,GITTES,I'll take care of it.
154946,L130625,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I have to go home and get my things.
154947,L130624,u4477,m296,GITTES,"That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything."
154948,L130623,u4476,m296,EVELYN,How about a plane?
154949,L130622,u4477,m296,GITTES,You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
154950,L130621,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Back to Mexico.
154951,L130620,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah... where are you taking her now?
154952,L130618,u4477,m296,GITTES,...so that's why you hate him...
154953,L130617,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
154954,L130616,u4477,m296,GITTES,To Mexico...
154955,L130615,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away..."
154956,L130612,u4476,m296,EVELYN,She's my sister and my daughter!
154957,L130611,u4477,m296,GITTES,I said I want the truth.
154958,L130607,u4476,m296,EVELYN,She's my sister.
154959,L130606,u4477,m296,GITTES,I said the truth!
154960,L130605,u4476,m296,EVELYN,She's my daughter.
154961,L130604,u4477,m296,GITTES,Katherine?... Katherine who?
154962,L130603,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Katherine.
154963,L130602,u4477,m296,GITTES,That's good. Now what's her name?
154964,L130600,u4477,m296,GITTES,Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
154965,L130599,u4476,m296,EVELYN,...no...
154966,L130598,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?"
154967,L130597,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
154968,L130596,u4477,m296,GITTES,"There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license."
154969,L130595,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What are you saying?
154970,L130594,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
154971,L130593,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"I don't know. I mean yes, probably."
154972,L130592,u4477,m296,GITTES,"I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?"
154973,L130591,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What the hell is this all about?
154974,L130590,u4477,m296,GITTES,Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
154975,L130589,u4476,m296,EVELYN,No...
154976,L130588,u4477,m296,GITTES,You know any good criminal lawyers?
154977,L130587,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What did you do that for?
154978,L130586,u4477,m296,GITTES,"You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can."
154979,L130585,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
154980,L130584,u4477,m296,GITTES,J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
154981,L130583,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?"
154982,L130582,u4477,m296,GITTES,Going somewhere?
154983,L130581,u4476,m296,EVELYN,...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
154984,L130580,u4477,m296,GITTES,I want to see her.
154985,L130579,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Upstairs. Why?
154986,L130578,u4477,m296,GITTES,Where's the girl?
154987,L130577,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
154988,L130576,u4477,m296,GITTES,Sure.
154989,L130575,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Did you get some sleep?
154990,L130487,u4476,m296,EVELYN,...That's not what I meant.
154991,L130486,u4477,m296,GITTES,Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
154992,L130485,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Aren't you coming back with me?
154993,L130484,u4477,m296,GITTES,I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
154994,L130482,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?"
154995,L130481,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I can't...
154996,L130478,u4477,m296,GITTES,I will if you don't.
154997,L130477,u4476,m296,EVELYN,You won't go to the police if I tell you?
154998,L130476,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know."
154999,L130475,u4476,m296,EVELYN,You're insane.
155000,L130474,u4477,m296,GITTES,Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
155001,L130473,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What does it look like?
155002,L130472,u4477,m296,GITTES,"That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray."
155003,L130471,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Yes.
155004,L130470,u4477,m296,GITTES,You mean she just found out?
155005,L130469,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave."
155006,L130468,u4477,m296,GITTES,What about?
155007,L130467,u4476,m296,EVELYN,She's too upset.
155008,L130465,u4477,m296,GITTES,Then let's go talk to her.
155009,L130464,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I am not!
155010,L130463,u4477,m296,GITTES,You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
155011,L130462,u4476,m296,EVELYN,She's not tied up!
155012,L130461,u4477,m296,GITTES,"C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!"
155013,L130460,u4476,m296,EVELYN,The police?
155014,L130459,u4477,m296,GITTES,It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
155015,L130458,u4476,m296,EVELYN,You bastard.
155016,L130457,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Okay, give me the keys."
155017,L130456,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here."
155018,L130455,u4477,m296,GITTES,Including the death of your husband?
155019,L130454,u4476,m296,EVELYN,It's possible.
155020,L130453,u4477,m296,GITTES,That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
155021,L130452,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"You may think you know what's going on, but you don't."
155022,L130451,u4477,m296,GITTES,Give me an example.
155023,L130450,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
155024,L130449,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was."
155025,L130448,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Do? To who?
155026,L130447,u4477,m296,GITTES,"That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do."
155027,L130446,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What did he say?  What did he say?
155028,L130445,u4477,m296,GITTES,There hasn't been a lot of time.
155029,L130444,u4476,m296,EVELYN,You didn't tell me.
155030,L130443,u4477,m296,GITTES,This morning.
155031,L130442,u4476,m296,EVELYN,You saw my fa... father? When?
155032,L130441,u4477,m296,GITTES,I saw him.
155033,L130440,u4476,m296,EVELYN,He owns it. You know?
155034,L130439,u4477,m296,GITTES,I know.
155035,L130438,u4476,m296,EVELYN,It has to do with my father.
155036,L130437,u4477,m296,GITTES,The Albacore Club.
155037,L130436,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag."
155038,L130435,u4477,m296,GITTES,Where are you going?
155039,L130434,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you."
155040,L130433,u4477,m296,GITTES,And I want to know where.
155041,L130432,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Just... I have to.
155042,L130431,u4477,m296,GITTES,Where?
155043,L130428,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"...Yes, sort of a birthmark..."
155044,L130427,u4477,m296,GITTES,...A flaw...
155045,L130426,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
155046,L130425,u4477,m296,GITTES,There's something black in the green part of your eye.
155047,L130424,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What about it?
155048,L130423,u4477,m296,GITTES,Your eye.
155049,L130422,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What's wrong?
155050,L130420,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Could you do anything about it?
155051,L130419,u4477,m296,GITTES,I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
155052,L130418,u4476,m296,EVELYN,...No. Why was it.
155053,L130417,u4477,m296,GITTES,You can't always tell what's going on there.
155054,L130416,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Hold still. Why?
155055,L130415,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was..."
155056,L130414,u4476,m296,EVELYN,So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
155057,L130413,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah.
155058,L130412,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Boy oh boy, you're a mess."
155059,L130407,u4477,m296,GITTES,They do in Chinatown.
155060,L130406,u4476,m296,EVELYN,The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
155061,L130405,u4477,m296,GITTES,As little as possible.
155062,L130404,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Doing what?
155063,L130403,u4477,m296,GITTES,Working for the District Attorney.
155064,L130402,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What were you doing there?
155065,L130401,u4477,m296,GITTES,It was in Chinatown.
155066,L130400,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
155067,L130399,u4477,m296,GITTES,Why?
155068,L130398,u4476,m296,EVELYN,When was the last time?
155069,L130397,u4477,m296,GITTES,Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
155070,L130396,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day."
155071,L130395,u4477,m296,GITTES,"What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?"
155072,L130394,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?"
155073,L130393,u4477,m296,GITTES,"I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight."
155074,L130392,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes."
155075,L130391,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Easy, it's an innocent question."
155076,L130390,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I gave everybody the night off.
155077,L130389,u4477,m296,GITTES,"What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all."
155078,L130388,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Why?
155079,L130387,u4477,m296,GITTES,Maid's night off?
155080,L130383,u4477,m296,GITTES,Get in the car.
155081,L130382,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I'll stay.
155082,L130356,u4477,m296,GITTES,They may not know it but they are.
155083,L130355,u4476,m296,EVELYN,They can't be.
155084,L130354,u4477,m296,GITTES,"You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire."
155085,L130330,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual."
155086,L130329,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Is that unusual?
155087,L130328,u4477,m296,GITTES,There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
155088,L130327,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What? What is it?
155089,L130326,u4477,m296,GITTES,"We got it. We got it, baby."
155090,L130325,u4477,m296,GITTES,It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
155091,L130324,u4476,m296,EVELYN,And Hollis knew about it?
155092,L130323,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
155093,L130322,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"No, I think I'd remember."
155094,L130321,u4477,m296,GITTES,Know him?
155095,L130320,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Jasper Lamar Crabb?
155096,L130319,u4477,m296,GITTES,"In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres."
155097,L130318,u4476,m296,EVELYN,No.
155098,L130317,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?"
155099,L130316,u4476,m296,EVELYN,The Valley?
155100,L130315,u4477,m296,GITTES,"The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here."
155101,L130314,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What dam?
155102,L130313,u4477,m296,GITTES,That dam is a con job.
155103,L130150,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it."
155104,L130149,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What are you thinking?
155105,L130147,u4477,m296,GITTES,What about you? Do you and your father get along?
155106,L130146,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Of course I'm sure.
155107,L130145,u4477,m296,GITTES,You sure shout that?
155108,L130144,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day."
155109,L130143,u4477,m296,GITTES,Never forgave him for what?
155110,L130142,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Yes. He never forgave him for it.
155111,L130141,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Oh, yeah?"
155112,L130140,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke."
155113,L130139,u4477,m296,GITTES,Then it was over the water department.
155114,L130138,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
155115,L130137,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Over the water department, or over you?"
155116,L130136,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out..."
155117,L130135,u4477,m296,GITTES,Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
155118,L130134,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Oh.
155119,L130133,u4477,m296,GITTES,"You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray."
155120,L130132,u4477,m296,GITTES,So you married your father's business partner?
155121,L130131,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that."
155122,L130130,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?"
155123,L130128,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
155124,L130127,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know."
155125,L130126,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?"
155126,L130076,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please."
155127,L130075,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me."
155128,L130074,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard."
155129,L130068,u4477,m296,GITTES,Another satisfied client's wife.
155130,L130067,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Another satisfied client?
155131,L130062,u4477,m296,GITTES,More like other people putting their business in my nose.
155132,L130061,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
155133,L130060,u4477,m296,GITTES,Been meaning to talk to you about that.
155134,L130059,u4476,m296,EVELYN,How did it happen?
155135,L130056,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I don't believe you.
155136,L130055,u4477,m296,GITTES,"No, not for that one."
155137,L130054,u4476,m296,EVELYN,You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
155138,L130053,u4477,m296,GITTES,No. I'm just a snoop.
155139,L130052,u4476,m296,EVELYN,You must've had a reason to ask me that.
155140,L130051,u4477,m296,GITTES,No reason.
155141,L130050,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Yes... why?
155142,L130049,u4477,m296,GITTES,That your maiden name?
155143,L130048,u4476,m296,EVELYN,K... Cross.
155144,L130046,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?"
155145,L130045,u4477,m296,GITTES,For very long?
155146,L130044,u4477,m296,GITTES,"You were seeing someone, too."
155147,L130043,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I mean I can't tell you.
155148,L130042,u4477,m296,GITTES,You mean you don't know where you were?
155149,L130041,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I can't tell you.
155150,L130040,u4477,m296,GITTES,Where you were when your husband died.
155151,L130039,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Is there anything else you want to know?
155152,L130038,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean."
155153,L130037,u4477,m296,GITTES,Did he know?
155154,L130036,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Mr. Gittes.
155155,L130035,u4477,m296,GITTES,Did you have affairs?
155156,L130034,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I don't like the word 'cheat.'
155157,L130032,u4477,m296,GITTES,She's cheating on him.
155158,L130031,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Unless what?
155159,L130030,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience."
155160,L130029,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Why?
155161,L130028,u4477,m296,GITTES,"You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray."
155162,L130027,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I was grateful.
155163,L130026,u4477,m296,GITTES,And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
155164,L130025,u4477,m296,GITTES,He told you?
155165,L130024,u4476,m296,EVELYN,My husband.
155166,L130023,u4477,m296,GITTES,How did you find out?
155167,L130022,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair."
155168,L130020,u4476,m296,EVELYN,But he wasn't killed.
155169,L130019,u4477,m296,GITTES,If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
155170,L130018,u4476,m296,EVELYN,It wasn't much of a lie.
155171,L130017,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police."
155172,L130016,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
155173,L130015,u4477,m296,GITTES,I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
155174,L130014,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I have?
155175,L130013,u4477,m296,GITTES,Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
155176,L130012,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Well, how much would you like?"
155177,L130011,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough."
155178,L130010,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Yes. As I said, I was very grateful."
155179,L130009,u4477,m296,GITTES,I got your check in the mall.
155180,L129927,u4477,m296,GITTES,A check?
155181,L129926,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
155182,L129925,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Oh... thank you.
155183,L129924,u4477,m296,GITTES,You left your keys in the ignition.
155184,L129923,u4476,m296,EVELYN,...Just a minute...
155185,L129922,u4477,m296,GITTES,Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
155186,L129859,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Please call first.
155187,L129858,u4477,m296,GITTES,I'll stop by.
155188,L129857,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30."
155189,L129856,u4477,m296,GITTES,Looks like you went quite a distance.
155190,L129855,u4476,m296,EVELYN,No. I went riding rather early.
155191,L129854,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?"
155192,L129853,u4476,m296,EVELYN,It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
155193,L129852,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --"
155194,L129851,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
155195,L129850,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere."
155196,L129849,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"You may if you can, Mr. Gittes."
155197,L129848,u4477,m296,GITTES,"May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?"
155198,L129847,u4476,m296,EVELYN,What do you mean?
155199,L129846,u4477,m296,GITTES,"You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem."
155200,L129845,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that."
155201,L129844,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man."
155202,L129843,u4477,m296,GITTES,I should talk this over with your husband.
155203,L129842,u4477,m296,GITTES,I don't want to drop it.
155204,L129841,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Yes, Mr. Gittes?"
155205,L129840,u4477,m296,GITTES,Mrs. Mulwray?
155206,L129839,u4476,m296,EVELYN,So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
155207,L129838,u4476,m296,EVELYN,I said I'll drop it.
155208,L129837,u4477,m296,GITTES,What?
155209,L129836,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit."
155210,L129835,u4477,m296,GITTES,"I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke."
155211,L129834,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk."
155212,L129833,u4476,m296,EVELYN,That's not his apartment.
155213,L129832,u4477,m296,GITTES,Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
155214,L129831,u4476,m296,EVELYN,My husband's at the office.
155215,L129830,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Yeah. Fine, thank you."
155216,L129829,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Iced tea.
155217,L129828,u4477,m296,GITTES,What are you having?
155218,L129827,u4476,m296,EVELYN,Would you like something to drink?
155219,L129773,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray..."
155220,L129772,u4476,m296,EVELYN,"Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it."
155221,L129771,u4477,m296,GITTES,Not that Mulwray?
155222,L129789,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me  so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town."
155223,L129788,u4486,m296,SOPHIE,"Yes, Mr. Gittes."
155224,L129787,u4477,m296,GITTES,Sophie.
155225,L129757,u4486,m296,SOPHIE,"Yes, Mr. Gittes."
155226,L129756,u4477,m296,GITTES,Sophie.
155227,L129755,u4486,m296,SOPHIE,"But, Mr. Gittes."
155228,L129754,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute."
155229,L129706,u4486,m296,SOPHIE,He's in the dark room.
155230,L129705,u4477,m296,GITTES,Walsh here?
155231,L130642,u4491,m296,WALSH'S VOICE,"Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?"
155232,L130641,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda."
155233,L129714,u4491,m296,WALSH'S VOICE,"It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?"
155234,L129713,u4477,m296,GITTES,Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
155235,L129712,u4491,m296,WALSH'S VOICE,I think I got something.
155236,L129711,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something."
155237,L129710,u4491,m296,WALSH'S VOICE,What'd you expect? That's his job.
155238,L129709,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain."
155239,L129708,u4491,m296,WALSH'S VOICE,"Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle."
155240,L129707,u4477,m296,GITTES,Where'd he go yesterday?
155241,L130006,u4477,m296,GITTES,'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
155242,L130005,u4478,m296,IDA'S VOICE,You'll find one of those people.
155243,L130004,u4477,m296,GITTES,The obituary column?
155244,L130003,u4478,m296,IDA'S VOICE,"No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times..."
155245,L130002,u4477,m296,GITTES,...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
155246,L130001,u4478,m296,IDA'S VOICE,Oh no.
155247,L130000,u4477,m296,GITTES,"I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both."
155248,L129999,u4478,m296,IDA'S VOICE,"Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen."
155249,L129998,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?"
155250,L129997,u4478,m296,IDA'S VOICE,"I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?"
155251,L129996,u4477,m296,GITTES,When did you come in?
155252,L129995,u4478,m296,IDA'S VOICE,"Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own."
155253,L129994,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?"
155254,L129993,u4478,m296,IDA'S VOICE,"Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?"
155255,L129992,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure."
155256,L129991,u4477,m296,GITTES,Okay.
155257,L129990,u4487,m296,SOPHIE'S VOICE,Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
155258,L129981,u4477,m296,GITTES,Don't know her. Take a number.
155259,L129980,u4487,m296,SOPHIE'S VOICE,Ida Sessions.
155260,L129979,u4477,m296,GITTES,Who?
155261,L129978,u4487,m296,SOPHIE'S VOICE,A Miss Sessions calling.
155262,L129977,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Yeah, Sophie."
155263,L130352,u4477,m296,GITTES,"We understand, c'mon, sweetheart."
155264,L130351,u4482,m296,PALMER,"Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime."
155265,L130350,u4477,m296,GITTES,Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
155266,L130349,u4482,m296,PALMER,I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
155267,L130348,u4477,m296,GITTES,"I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?"
155268,L130347,u4482,m296,PALMER,"Oh, good."
155269,L130346,u4477,m296,GITTES,That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
155270,L130345,u4482,m296,PALMER,We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
155271,L130344,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?"
155272,L130343,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?"
155273,L130342,u4482,m296,PALMER,I'm sorry. We don't.
155274,L130341,u4477,m296,GITTES,Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
155275,L130340,u4482,m296,PALMER,Of course.
155276,L130339,u4477,m296,GITTES,There's just one question.
155277,L130338,u4482,m296,PALMER,Perhaps if we could meet your father.
155278,L130337,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object."
155279,L130334,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually."
155280,L130333,u4482,m296,PALMER,Oh my goodness.
155281,L130123,u4477,m296,GITTES,I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
155282,L130122,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,Yes...
155283,L130121,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Hard working, have a wife and kids..."
155284,L130120,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,Yes...
155285,L130119,u4477,m296,GITTES,"You're a married man, am I right?"
155286,L130118,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,"Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location..."
155287,L130117,u4477,m296,GITTES,That's like saying they're in Arizona.
155288,L130116,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,"I said, the northwest valley."
155289,L130115,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?"
155290,L130114,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,"Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff."
155291,L130113,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news."
155292,L130112,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
155293,L130111,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned."
155294,L130110,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,"Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense."
155295,L130109,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me."
155296,L130108,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,I don't understand.
155297,L130107,u4477,m296,GITTES,I never was.
155298,L130106,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
155299,L130105,u4477,m296,GITTES,Only when I breathe.
155300,L130104,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
155301,L130103,u4477,m296,GITTES,I cut myself shaving.
155302,L130102,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,"Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?"
155303,L130101,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances."
155304,L130100,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,"Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on."
155305,L129819,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,Hope so. He's working for us.
155306,L129818,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?"
155307,L129814,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,Help yourself.
155308,L129813,u4477,m296,GITTES,Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
155309,L129812,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, tell him I'll be back."
155310,L129811,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,"I'm sorry, I --"
155311,L129810,u4477,m296,GITTES,You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
155312,L129809,u4477,m296,GITTES,Maybe he takes it very seriously.
155313,L129808,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,He never even kids about it.
155314,L129807,u4477,m296,GITTES,And Mulwray isn't?
155315,L129806,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,"After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't."
155316,L129804,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
155317,L129803,u4477,m296,GITTES,J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
155318,L129802,u4492,m296,YELBURTON,"Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department."
155319,L129770,u4493,m296,YOUNG WOMAN,"That's what I thought. You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife."
155320,L129769,u4477,m296,GITTES,Never.
155321,L129768,u4493,m296,YOUNG WOMAN,Never?
155322,L129767,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, no."
155323,L129766,u4493,m296,YOUNG WOMAN,Have we ever met?
155324,L129765,u4477,m296,GITTES,Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
155325,L129764,u4493,m296,YOUNG WOMAN,Do you know me?
155326,L129763,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yes?
155327,L129762,u4493,m296,YOUNG WOMAN,Mr. Gittes?
155328,L129969,u4488,m296,THE BOY,Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.
155329,L129968,u4477,m296,GITTES,When it comes? What'd you tell him?
155330,L129967,u4488,m296,THE BOY,When it comes.
155331,L129966,u4477,m296,GITTES,What about the water?
155332,L129965,u4488,m296,THE BOY,The water.
155333,L129963,u4477,m296,GITTES,Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
155334,L129962,u4488,m296,THE BOY,Si.
155335,L129961,u4477,m296,GITTES,Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
155336,L129957,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon."
155337,L129956,u4479,m296,MORTY,It's not completely dry.
155338,L129955,u4477,m296,GITTES,"It's bone dry, Morty."
155339,L129954,u4479,m296,MORTY,"Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?"
155340,L129953,u4477,m296,GITTES,The L.A. River?
155341,L129952,u4479,m296,MORTY,"Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed."
155342,L129951,u4477,m296,GITTES,Come again?
155343,L129950,u4479,m296,MORTY,"Drowned, too."
155344,L129949,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah.
155345,L129944,u4477,m296,GITTES,"So how are you, Morty?"
155346,L129943,u4479,m296,MORTY,That's a long fall.
155347,L129942,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
155348,L129941,u4479,m296,MORTY,"Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A."
155349,L129940,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately."
155350,L129939,u4479,m296,MORTY,"Jake, what're you doin' here?"
155351,L130496,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office."
155352,L130495,u4489,m296,VOICE ON PHONE,Sure you do.
155353,L130494,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah?... I do?
155354,L130492,u4477,m296,GITTES,Who?
155355,L130491,u4489,m296,VOICE ON PHONE,Ida Sessions wants to see you.
155356,L130490,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah.
155357,L130489,u4489,m296,VOICE ON PHONE,Gittes?... Gittes?
155358,L129694,u4480,m296,MRS. MULWRAY,"Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes."
155359,L129693,u4477,m296,GITTES,"This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time."
155360,L129690,u4477,m296,GITTES,Water and Power?
155361,L129689,u4480,m296,MRS. MULWRAY,Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
155362,L129688,u4477,m296,GITTES,"All right, what's your husband's first name?"
155363,L129687,u4480,m296,MRS. MULWRAY,But I have to know.
155364,L129686,u4477,m296,GITTES,"I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing."
155365,L129685,u4480,m296,MRS. MULWRAY,But...
155366,L129684,u4477,m296,GITTES,Then go home and forget about it.
155367,L129683,u4480,m296,MRS. MULWRAY,...Yes of course.
155368,L129682,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?"
155369,L129680,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?"
155370,L129679,u4480,m296,MRS. MULWRAY,Of course not.
155371,L129678,u4477,m296,GITTES,"I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself."
155372,L129677,u4480,m296,MRS. MULWRAY,"Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?"
155373,L129676,u4477,m296,GITTES,I am sorry.
155374,L129675,u4480,m296,MRS. MULWRAY,I'm afraid so.
155375,L129674,u4477,m296,GITTES,"No, really?"
155376,L129672,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?"
155377,L129671,u4480,m296,MRS. MULWRAY,Mr. Gittes...
155378,L129670,u4477,m296,GITTES,"How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?"
155379,L130286,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Yeah, I'll do that."
155380,L130285,u4484,m296,RAINMAKER,Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
155381,L130284,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah.
155382,L130283,u4484,m296,RAINMAKER,Never heard of 'em... new owners?
155383,L130282,u4477,m296,GITTES,"That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?"
155384,L130281,u4484,m296,RAINMAKER,"City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days."
155385,L130280,u4477,m296,GITTES,Yeah.  Do you have any references?
155386,L130279,u4484,m296,RAINMAKER,No problem with me on the Job.
155387,L130098,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,"Yes. Yes, they were partners."
155388,L130097,u4477,m296,GITTES,They were partners.
155389,L130096,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,Along with Mr. Mulwray.
155390,L130095,u4477,m296,GITTES,Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
155391,L130094,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
155392,L130093,u4477,m296,GITTES,How did they get it away from him?
155393,L130092,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,Yes.
155394,L130091,u4477,m296,GITTES,He owned the entire water supply for the city?
155395,L130090,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,Yes.
155396,L130089,u4477,m296,GITTES,He owned the water department?
155397,L130088,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,He owned it.
155398,L130087,u4477,m296,GITTES,He did or he didn't?
155399,L130086,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,Yes. No.
155400,L130085,u4477,m296,GITTES,Julian Cross worked for the water department?
155401,L130083,u4477,m296,GITTES,I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
155402,L130082,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
155403,L130081,u4477,m296,GITTES,Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
155404,L130080,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
155405,L129801,u4477,m296,GITTES,Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go in and wait?
155406,L129800,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,He was expecting you?
155407,L129799,u4477,m296,GITTES,Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
155408,L129798,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,Since lunch.
155409,L129797,u4477,m296,GITTES,It's personal. Has he been out long?
155410,L129796,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,May I ask what this is regarding?
155411,L129795,u4477,m296,GITTES,Gittes.
155412,L129794,u4485,m296,SECRETARY,"He's not in, Mr.?"
155413,L129793,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Mr. Mulwray, please."
155414,L130748,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this."
155415,L130747,u4490,m296,WALSH,"Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better."
155416,L130746,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you."
155417,L129989,u4490,m296,WALSH,Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
155418,L129988,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives."
155419,L129987,u4490,m296,WALSH,Yeah?
155420,L129984,u4477,m296,GITTES,I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
155421,L129983,u4490,m296,WALSH,Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
155422,L129792,u4477,m296,GITTES,They're all a bunch of phonies.
155423,L129791,u4490,m296,WALSH,So he says you sent them?
155424,L129786,u4477,m296,GITTES,When I find out who that phony bitch was.
155425,L129785,u4490,m296,WALSH,"No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer."
155426,L129784,u4477,m296,GITTES,All she needed for that was the phone book!
155427,L129783,u4490,m296,WALSH,"Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address."
155428,L129725,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain finesse."
155429,L129724,u4490,m296,WALSH,"Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures."
155430,L129723,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?"
155431,L129722,u4490,m296,WALSH,Yeah.
155432,L129721,u4477,m296,GITTES,Apple core?
155433,L129720,u4490,m296,WALSH,I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing  apple core.
155434,L129719,u4477,m296,GITTES,What about?
155435,L129718,u4490,m296,WALSH,They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
155436,L129717,u4477,m296,GITTES,This?
155437,L129742,u4481,m296,OTHER CUSTOMER,"No, you have a press agent do it."
155438,L129741,u4477,m296,GITTES,Neither do I.
155439,L129740,u4481,m296,OTHER CUSTOMER,"We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that."
155440,L129739,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?"
155441,L129738,u4481,m296,OTHER CUSTOMER,"Mortgage Department, First National Bank."
155442,L129737,u4477,m296,GITTES,Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
155443,L129736,u4481,m296,OTHER CUSTOMER,Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
155444,L129735,u4477,m296,GITTES,"What's that, pal?"
155445,L130175,u4483,m296,PILOT,"Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money."
155446,L130174,u4477,m296,GITTES,You don't say?
155447,L130173,u4483,m296,PILOT,She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
155448,L130172,u4477,m296,GITTES,"We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?"
155449,L130171,u4483,m296,PILOT,"Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen."
155450,L130170,u4477,m296,GITTES,Why'd she run away?
155451,L130169,u4483,m296,PILOT,That's for sure.
155452,L130168,u4477,m296,GITTES,"Well, you never know, do you?"
155453,L130167,u4483,m296,PILOT,"Course, she settled down nicely."
155454,L130166,u4483,m296,PILOT,"Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing."
155455,L130165,u4477,m296,GITTES,She ran away?
155456,L130164,u4483,m296,PILOT,"No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away."
155457,L130163,u4477,m296,GITTES,You must be thinking of a different daughter.
155458,L130162,u4483,m296,PILOT,"She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four."
155459,L130161,u4477,m296,GITTES,She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
155460,L130160,u4483,m296,PILOT,That right?... She used to be some looker.
155461,L130159,u4477,m296,GITTES,I'm working for his daughter.
155462,L130158,u4483,m296,PILOT,"Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people."
155463,L130157,u4477,m296,GITTES,I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
155464,L130156,u4483,m296,PILOT,"Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?"
155465,L130155,u4483,m296,PILOT,But that's what you told your wife.
155466,L130154,u4477,m296,GITTES,Not exactly.
155467,L133158,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little..."
155468,L133157,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Thanks for all you've done for me.
155469,L133155,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you."
155470,L133154,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?"
155471,L133153,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am."
155472,L133152,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him..."
155473,L133151,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?"
155474,L133150,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
155475,L133149,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,No. And nobody knows where she is.
155476,L133148,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,Did you ever see her again?
155477,L133146,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach."
155478,L133145,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?"
155479,L133144,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
155480,L133137,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"No, nobody came."
155481,L133136,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?"
155482,L133135,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"But where'd you go, Toto?!!"
155483,L133130,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
155484,L133129,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you..."
155485,L133128,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,You weren't expecting me?
155486,L133100,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,Could be...But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.
155487,L133099,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss..."
155488,L133098,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?"
155489,L133064,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know..."
155490,L133063,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!"
155491,L133062,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything."
155492,L133061,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case."
155493,L133060,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world!
155494,L133059,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand."
155495,L133058,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
155496,L133057,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult."
155497,L133037,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
155498,L133036,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,What you say is wonderful! But sad...
155499,L133035,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants..."
155500,L133033,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,What's she like? What's she like?...
155501,L133032,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station."
155502,L133031,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
155503,L133030,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus."
155504,L133029,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,Now what can you see?
155505,L133028,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die."
155506,L133027,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"What is it, what is it? What's the picture?"
155507,L133026,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Yes.
155508,L133025,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going?"
155509,L133024,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"That's right, Modern Times."
155510,L133023,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?"
155511,L133010,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,Progress! It always arrives too late!
155512,L133009,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
155513,L132981,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see."
155514,L132980,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Yes. I want proof.
155515,L132979,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?"
155516,L132978,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Why? What do you mean?
155517,L132977,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
155518,L132976,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going..."
155519,L132975,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,How's school?
155520,L132972,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Come in, Alfredo."
155521,L132971,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?
155522,L132938,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Too bad!
155523,L132937,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
155524,L132928,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
155525,L132927,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal...
155526,L132926,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Will they really find work in Germany?
155527,L132917,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,It tastes wonderful!
155528,L132916,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,You understand which side the gelatin's on?
155529,L132906,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!!"
155530,L132905,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt!"
155531,L132904,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,But don't you like anything about what you do?
155532,L132903,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing."
155533,L132902,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,No...
155534,L132901,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!"
155535,L132900,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Then why don't you change jobs?
155536,L132899,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!"
155537,L132898,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?"
155538,L132897,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!"
155539,L132896,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Toto, come here."
155540,L132895,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going."
155541,L132882,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them!"
155542,L132881,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,But you don't have any kids!!!
155543,L132880,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!"
155544,L132878,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable."
155545,L132877,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Alfredo, did you know my father?"
155546,L132869,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,What you find tonight on the floor between the seats?
155547,L132868,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Fifty lire...
155548,L132867,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?"
155549,L132849,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film.
155550,L132848,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,What are you doing here?
155551,L132831,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!"
155552,L132830,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,So I can have these?
155553,L132829,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count."
155554,L132824,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
155555,L132823,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of..."
155556,L133086,u4497,m297,PRIEST,And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
155557,L133085,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear."
155558,L133084,u4497,m297,PRIEST,You understand now? You see it clearly?
155559,L133074,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for..."
155560,L133073,u4497,m297,PRIEST,"But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!"
155561,L133067,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind..."
155562,L133066,u4497,m297,PRIEST,"What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!"
155563,L132875,u4497,m297,PRIEST,"Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done."
155564,L132874,u4494,m297,ALFREDO,"Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?"
155565,L133247,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena."
155566,L133246,u4495,m297,ELENA,"No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending."
155567,L133238,u4495,m297,ELENA,"What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own."
155568,L133237,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation..."
155569,L133236,u4495,m297,ELENA,"He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too."
155570,L133235,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!"
155571,L133232,u4495,m297,ELENA,I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs...
155572,L133231,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!"
155573,L133230,u4495,m297,ELENA,It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
155574,L133222,u4495,m297,ELENA,Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
155575,L133221,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"But I've never forgotten you, Elena!"
155576,L133218,u4495,m297,ELENA,Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
155577,L133217,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?"
155578,L133216,u4495,m297,ELENA,My husband...you know him.
155579,L133215,u4495,m297,ELENA,"All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then..."
155580,L133214,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
155581,L133213,u4495,m297,ELENA,"One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?"
155582,L133212,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
155583,L133211,u4495,m297,ELENA,Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
155584,L133210,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
155585,L133209,u4495,m297,ELENA,"Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?"
155586,L133208,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,You're still beautiful...
155587,L133124,u4495,m297,ELENA,The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
155588,L133123,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Who?
155589,L133122,u4495,m297,ELENA,"He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me."
155590,L133121,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time."
155591,L133120,u4495,m297,ELENA,"No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father."
155592,L133119,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go..."
155593,L133118,u4495,m297,ELENA,So what'd they say?
155594,L133114,u4495,m297,ELENA,I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
155595,L133113,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Elena!...But when...
155596,L133095,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in..."
155597,L133094,u4495,m297,ELENA,You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
155598,L133083,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand..."
155599,L133082,u4495,m297,ELENA,For what?
155600,L133081,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,I don't care. I'll wait.
155601,L133071,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore."
155602,L133070,u4495,m297,ELENA,But...who...
155603,L133069,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,We'll talk about that later.
155604,L133068,u4495,m297,ELENA,"Father, I have sinned..."
155605,L133043,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!"
155606,L133042,u4495,m297,ELENA,"Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye."
155607,L133041,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"No particular reason...  Nice day, huh?"
155608,L133040,u4495,m297,ELENA,Hi. Why are you running?
155609,L133039,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Hi, Elena!"
155610,L133021,u4495,m297,ELENA,Elena. My name's Elena.
155611,L133020,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,My name's Salvatore...And yours?
155612,L133187,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,You never used to do that!
155613,L133186,u4496,m297,MARIA,"And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night..."
155614,L133185,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation..."
155615,L133166,u4496,m297,MARIA,"You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in..."
155616,L133165,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know."
155617,L133164,u4496,m297,MARIA,"See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral."
155618,L133163,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
155619,L133162,u4496,m297,MARIA,"Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now."
155620,L132890,u4496,m297,MARIA,It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
155621,L132889,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.
155622,L132865,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,Somebody stole it.
155623,L132864,u4496,m297,MARIA,Then where's the money?
155624,L132863,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,No...
155625,L132862,u4496,m297,MARIA,I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
155626,L132838,u4496,m297,MARIA,"It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late."
155627,L132837,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?"
155628,L133171,u4499,m297,SPACCAFICO,"Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!..."
155629,L133170,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
155630,L133169,u4499,m297,SPACCAFICO,"Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You ""know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!..."
155631,L133168,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,How long's it been shut?
155632,L133126,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,OK...
155633,L133125,u4499,m297,SPACCAFICO,"Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready."
155634,L132987,u4499,m297,SPACCAFICO,"What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!"
155635,L132986,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses."
155636,L132985,u4499,m297,SPACCAFICO,So what's that got to do with it?
155637,L132984,u4498,m297,SALVATORE,"Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?"
155638,L133880,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?"
155639,L133879,u4505,m298,KANE,"Please, Mr. Bernstein."
155640,L133878,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?"
155641,L133877,u4505,m298,KANE,You don't really think so?
155642,L133876,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful."
155643,L133650,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -"
155644,L133649,u4505,m298,KANE,"We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?"
155645,L133648,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -"
155646,L133647,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!"
155647,L133646,u4505,m298,KANE,"Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein."
155648,L133638,u4505,m298,KANE,I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
155649,L133637,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -"
155650,L133627,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven."
155651,L133626,u4505,m298,KANE,"Gentlemen of the ""Enquirer""!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the ""Enquirer's"" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark."
155652,L133623,u4505,m298,KANE,I know.
155653,L133622,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"You know how long it took the ""Chronicle"" to get that staff together?  Twenty years."
155654,L133621,u4505,m298,KANE,"You're right, Mr. Bernstein."
155655,L133620,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation."
155656,L133617,u4505,m298,KANE,Look at that.
155657,L133616,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
155658,L133615,u4505,m298,KANE,Let's hope they like it there.
155659,L133607,u4505,m298,KANE,These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
155660,L133606,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep."
155661,L133605,u4505,m298,KANE,I'll write it myself.
155662,L133604,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -"
155663,L133603,u4505,m298,KANE,"My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -"
155664,L133578,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Oh!
155665,L133577,u4505,m298,KANE,"It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean."
155666,L133574,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?"
155667,L133573,u4505,m298,KANE,"Ready for dinner, Brad?"
155668,L133572,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case."
155669,L133571,u4505,m298,KANE,"Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents."
155670,L133570,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,This is all figured at three cents a copy.
155671,L133569,u4505,m298,KANE,Two cents.
155672,L133568,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Three cents.
155673,L133563,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
155674,L133562,u4505,m298,KANE,"I've just made a shocking discovery. The ""Enquirer"" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!"
155675,L133527,u4505,m298,KANE,Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
155676,L133526,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,I can't take shorthand.
155677,L133525,u4505,m298,KANE,"It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it."
155678,L133524,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,I didn't see that.
155679,L133523,u4505,m298,KANE,"Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -"
155680,L133522,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,That's all there is.
155681,L133521,u4505,m298,KANE,Go on!
155682,L133520,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"""Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..."""
155683,L133519,u4505,m298,KANE,Thais.

155686,L133515,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard."
155687,L133513,u4505,m298,KANE,"That's all right, Mr. Bernstein."
155688,L133512,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Mr. Kane -
155689,L133510,u4505,m298,KANE,Where is he?
155690,L133509,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"He sure did, Mr. Kane."
155691,L133432,u4505,m298,KANE,I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
155692,L133431,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"That's fine, Mr. Kane."

155695,L133422,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"How are you, Mr. Thatcher?"
155696,L133421,u4505,m298,KANE,"Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -"
155697,L133490,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Well, well - isn't that nice?"
155698,L133489,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,"Yes, very!  Naturally."
155699,L133488,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Enthusiastic?
155700,L133487,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,"Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review."
155701,L133486,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
155702,L133485,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,"Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course."
155703,L133482,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,That's a long story.
155704,L133481,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
155705,L133480,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"That's right.  They called us the ""Three Musketeers."""
155706,L133479,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,"You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand."
155707,L133478,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,I might make him nervous.
155708,L133477,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,"Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland."
155709,L133476,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Go in and ask him to hurry.
155710,L133670,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to."
155711,L133669,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just -"
155712,L133668,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
155713,L133667,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street."
155714,L133666,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead."
155715,L133665,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,Yes -
155716,L133664,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -"
155717,L133663,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"It didn't end very well, did it?"
155718,L133662,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!"
155719,L133532,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer."
155720,L133531,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her."
155721,L133530,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -"
155722,L133529,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
155723,L133528,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
155724,L133471,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
155725,L133470,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,He made an awful lot of money.
155726,L133469,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
155727,L133468,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -"
155728,L133467,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Who else did you see?
155729,L133466,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,I'm going back there.
155730,L133465,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Sure, sure."
155731,L133464,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,You know why?  She was so -
155732,L133463,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
155733,L133462,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Well, I went down to Atlantic City -"
155734,L133461,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Who else you been to see?
155735,L133460,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
155736,L133459,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this ""Rosebud,"" Mr. Thompson."
155737,L133458,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -"
155738,L133457,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -"
155739,L133456,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -"
155740,L133455,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -"
155741,L133454,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -"
155742,L133453,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
155743,L133993,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
155744,L133992,u4507,m298,LELAND,I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
155745,L133991,u4507,m298,LELAND,Kane?  Charlie?  Where is he?
155746,L133990,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Mr. Kane is finishing it.
155747,L133989,u4507,m298,LELAND,Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
155748,L133988,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Hello, Bernstein."
155749,L133987,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Hello, Mr. Leland."
155750,L133795,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Yes, Mr. Bernstein."
155751,L133794,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?"
155752,L133793,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury."
155753,L133792,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows."
155754,L133789,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?"
155755,L133788,u4507,m298,LELAND,What's happened?
155756,L133732,u4507,m298,LELAND,September the ninth?
155757,L133731,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth."
155758,L133729,u4507,m298,LELAND,
155759,L133728,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't."
155760,L133727,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Yes.
155761,L133726,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?"
155762,L133725,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Don't I always?  Most of the time?
155763,L133724,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully."
155764,L133723,u4507,m298,LELAND,I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
155765,L133722,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -"
155766,L133721,u4507,m298,LELAND,Certainly not.
155767,L133720,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Do you, Mr. Leland?"
155768,L133688,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it."
155769,L133687,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week."
155770,L133686,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Do we stand for the same things that the ""Chronicle"" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?"
155771,L133684,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
155772,L133683,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the ""Enquirer"" - who were with the ""Chronicle"" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the ""Chronicle"" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?"
155773,L133682,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,What's the matter?
155774,L133680,u4507,m298,LELAND,Yes.
155775,L133679,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
155776,L133645,u4507,m298,LELAND,Certainly not.
155777,L133644,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"Do you, Mr. Leland?"
155778,L133614,u4507,m298,LELAND,That looks pretty nice.
155779,L133613,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Sixty-two thousand -
155780,L133600,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,"You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -"
155781,L133599,u4507,m298,LELAND,Charlie?!
155782,L133598,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Wasted?
155783,L133594,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
155784,L133593,u4507,m298,LELAND,"We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes."
155785,L133576,u4500,m298,BERNSTEIN,Who said anything about brooms?
155786,L133575,u4507,m298,LELAND,"I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!"
155787,L133586,u4501,m298,CARTER,"But Mr. Kane, I meant -"
155788,L133585,u4505,m298,KANE,"It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard."
155789,L133584,u4501,m298,CARTER,"I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted."
155790,L133565,u4505,m298,KANE,"That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!"
155791,L133564,u4501,m298,CARTER,"But, Mr. Kane -"
155792,L133560,u4501,m298,CARTER,"Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -"
155793,L133559,u4505,m298,KANE,"That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the ""Enquirer"" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear."
155794,L133558,u4501,m298,CARTER,"It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -"
155795,L133557,u4505,m298,KANE,"The ""Chronicle"" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious."
155796,L133556,u4501,m298,CARTER,"As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the ""Chronicle"" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead."
155797,L133555,u4505,m298,KANE,"If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -"
155798,L133554,u4501,m298,CARTER,There is no news big enough.
155799,L133553,u4505,m298,KANE,"I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The ""Chronicle"" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?"
155800,L133552,u4501,m298,CARTER,"Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet."
155801,L133551,u4505,m298,KANE,"I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the ""Chronicle,""  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the ""Enquirer"" have that this morning?"
155802,L133550,u4505,m298,KANE,"That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day."
155803,L133549,u4501,m298,CARTER,"But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -"
155804,L133548,u4505,m298,KANE,I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
155805,L133547,u4501,m298,CARTER,My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
155806,L133546,u4505,m298,KANE,"You've got a private office here, haven't you?"
155807,L133545,u4501,m298,CARTER,"How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?"
155808,L133544,u4505,m298,KANE,"Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager."
155809,L133540,u4505,m298,KANE,I don't my plans myself.
155810,L133539,u4501,m298,CARTER,"You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations."
155811,L133538,u4505,m298,KANE,Ask them to sit down.
155812,L133537,u4501,m298,CARTER,I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
155813,L133536,u4505,m298,KANE,Are they standing for me?
155814,L133535,u4501,m298,CARTER,"How do you do, Mr. Leland?"
155815,L133534,u4505,m298,KANE,"Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland."
155816,L133533,u4501,m298,CARTER,"Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the ""Enquirer."" I am Herbert Carter."
155817,L133508,u4505,m298,KANE,"He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?"
155818,L133507,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,We haven't heard from him.
155819,L133506,u4505,m298,KANE,Has he said when he'll finish?
155820,L133505,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,"Yes, Mr. Kane."
155821,L133504,u4505,m298,KANE,"That's Leland, isn't it?"
155822,L133503,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,"No, Mr. Kane."
155823,L133502,u4505,m298,KANE,It isn't finished?
155824,L133501,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
155825,L133500,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,"Yes, Mr. kane."
155826,L133499,u4505,m298,KANE,Is it good?
155827,L133498,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,Yes - Mr. Kane.
155828,L133497,u4505,m298,KANE,And the notice?
155829,L133496,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,"Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures."
155830,L133495,u4505,m298,KANE,Was the show covered by every department?
155831,L133494,u4505,m298,KANE,We've got a nice plant here.
155832,L133493,u4502,m298,CITY EDITOR,"Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!"
155833,L134120,u4505,m298,KANE,Of course.
155834,L134119,u4503,m298,DR. COREY,"Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too."
155835,L134118,u4505,m298,KANE,"There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?"
155836,L134117,u4503,m298,DR. COREY,I'm sure that's it.
155837,L134116,u4505,m298,KANE,Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
155838,L134115,u4503,m298,DR. COREY,"The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning."
155839,L133932,u4514,m298,ROGERS,"I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane."
155840,L133931,u4504,m298,EMILY,"You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you."
155841,L133926,u4514,m298,ROGERS,"The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane."
155842,L133925,u4504,m298,EMILY,"What story, Mr. Rogers?"
155843,L133921,u4504,m298,EMILY,"I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if -"
155844,L133920,u4514,m298,ROGERS,"I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -"
155845,L133919,u4504,m298,EMILY,"Let him finish, Charles."
155846,L133909,u4504,m298,EMILY,"Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -"
155847,L133908,u4514,m298,ROGERS,"Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane."
155848,L133905,u4514,m298,ROGERS,I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
155849,L133904,u4504,m298,EMILY,How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
155850,L133986,u4504,m298,EMILY,"If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time.  There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact.  That - that shabby little girl.  I'm really sorry for her, Brad."
155851,L133985,u4507,m298,LELAND,"He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -"
155852,L133984,u4504,m298,EMILY,"I know it is, Brad -"
155853,L133983,u4507,m298,LELAND,It's - all over -
155854,L133982,u4504,m298,EMILY,"Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -"
155855,L133981,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Emily, you -"
155856,L133980,u4504,m298,EMILY,Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
155857,L133979,u4507,m298,LELAND,"I know that, Emily -"
155858,L133978,u4504,m298,EMILY,"There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -"
155859,L133977,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -"
155860,L133976,u4504,m298,EMILY,"Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars."
155861,L133975,u4507,m298,LELAND,Emily!
155862,L133974,u4504,m298,EMILY,I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
155863,L133973,u4507,m298,LELAND,Almost two to one -
155864,L133969,u4507,m298,LELAND,Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
155865,L133968,u4504,m298,EMILY,"I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -"
155866,L133967,u4507,m298,LELAND,Emily -
155867,L133966,u4504,m298,EMILY,"Hello, Brad -"
155868,L133956,u4505,m298,KANE,"Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!"
155869,L133955,u4504,m298,EMILY,"Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -"
155870,L133949,u4505,m298,KANE,Go on!  Get out!  I can fight this thing all alone!
155871,L133948,u4504,m298,EMILY,"You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles."
155872,L133947,u4505,m298,KANE,There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
155873,L133946,u4505,m298,KANE,No.
155874,L133945,u4504,m298,EMILY,"I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?"
155875,L133944,u4505,m298,KANE,"Oh yes, there is."
155876,L133941,u4504,m298,EMILY,"I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing."
155877,L133940,u4505,m298,KANE,"I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -"
155878,L133939,u4504,m298,EMILY,"Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?"
155879,L133938,u4505,m298,KANE,"Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -"
155880,L133937,u4504,m298,EMILY,"I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -"
155881,L133936,u4505,m298,KANE,"You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?"
155882,L133916,u4505,m298,KANE,"You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -"
155883,L133915,u4504,m298,EMILY,Oh!!
155884,L133897,u4504,m298,EMILY,I'm going to -  - 185 West 74th Street.
155885,L133896,u4505,m298,KANE,I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
155886,L133895,u4504,m298,EMILY,I intend to find out.
155887,L133893,u4504,m298,EMILY,It may not be about anything at all.
155888,L133892,u4505,m298,KANE,"What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -"
155889,L133890,u4504,m298,EMILY,"No, it can't.  Good night, darling."
155890,L133889,u4505,m298,KANE,It can wait.
155891,L133888,u4504,m298,EMILY,"There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles."
155892,L133887,u4505,m298,KANE,But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
155893,L133886,u4504,m298,EMILY,"I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -"
155894,L133857,u4504,m298,EMILY,"They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!"
155895,L133856,u4505,m298,KANE,Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
155896,L133855,u4504,m298,EMILY,"Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here."
155897,L133854,u4505,m298,KANE,"I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind."
155898,L133853,u4504,m298,EMILY,Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
155899,L133852,u4504,m298,EMILY,"Please don't talk any more, Charles."
155900,L133851,u4505,m298,KANE,"They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -"
155901,L133849,u4504,m298,EMILY,Charles.
155902,L133848,u4505,m298,KANE,What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
155903,L134187,u4505,m298,KANE,"Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!"
155904,L134186,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said."
155905,L134185,u4505,m298,KANE,"Don't go, Susan."
155906,L134184,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Goodbye, Charlie."
155907,L134183,u4515,m298,SUSAN,You can't stop me.
155908,L134182,u4505,m298,KANE,I won't let you go.
155909,L134181,u4515,m298,SUSAN,- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
155910,L134180,u4505,m298,KANE,Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
155911,L134172,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Yes.
155912,L134171,u4505,m298,KANE,"No, you're not."
155913,L134170,u4515,m298,SUSAN,I'm going to leave you.
155914,L134169,u4505,m298,KANE,I'm not sorry.
155915,L134168,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Don't tell me you're sorry.
155916,L134167,u4505,m298,KANE,"Susan, it seems to me -"
155917,L134166,u4515,m298,SUSAN,You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
155918,L134164,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
155919,L134163,u4505,m298,KANE,"You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you."
155920,L134162,u4505,m298,KANE,Susan!
155921,L134161,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!"
155922,L134160,u4505,m298,KANE,"Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!"
155923,L134159,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about."
155924,L134158,u4505,m298,KANE,"Susan, I really think -"
155925,L134157,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -"
155926,L134156,u4505,m298,KANE,"As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want."
155927,L134155,u4515,m298,SUSAN,I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
155928,L134154,u4505,m298,KANE,"We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -"
155929,L134153,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was."
155930,L134152,u4505,m298,KANE,"You're my wife, Susan, and -"
155931,L134151,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!"
155932,L134150,u4505,m298,KANE,"I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan."
155933,L134149,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -"
155934,L134148,u4505,m298,KANE,"You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice."
155935,L134147,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -"
155936,L134141,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?"
155937,L134140,u4505,m298,KANE,I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
155938,L134139,u4515,m298,SUSAN,It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
155939,L134138,u4505,m298,KANE,You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
155940,L134137,u4515,m298,SUSAN,It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
155941,L134133,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Can't we go back, Charlie?"
155942,L134132,u4505,m298,KANE,You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
155943,L134131,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world."
155944,L134130,u4505,m298,KANE,Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
155945,L134129,u4515,m298,SUSAN,At night?
155946,L134128,u4505,m298,KANE,Half past eleven.
155947,L134127,u4515,m298,SUSAN,I mean in New York.
155948,L134126,u4505,m298,KANE,Half past eleven.
155949,L134125,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Charlie!  I said, what time is it?"
155950,L134122,u4505,m298,KANE,That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
155951,L134121,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0"
155952,L134088,u4505,m298,KANE,Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
155953,L134087,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Oh, no, that's all gone."
155954,L134086,u4505,m298,KANE,Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
155955,L134085,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Well, I -"
155956,L134084,u4505,m298,KANE,"Yes, I would.  That's why I asked."
155957,L134083,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing."
155958,L134082,u4505,m298,KANE,Would you sing for me?
155959,L134081,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"As a matter of fact, I do sing a little."
155960,L134080,u4505,m298,KANE,Yes -
155961,L134079,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like."
155962,L134078,u4505,m298,KANE,"What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?"
155963,L134077,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me."
155964,L134076,u4505,m298,KANE,Is that what you want to do?
155965,L134075,u4515,m298,SUSAN,I work at Seligman's.
155966,L134074,u4505,m298,KANE,That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
155967,L134073,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
155968,L134072,u4505,m298,KANE,"I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?"
155969,L134071,u4515,m298,SUSAN,I didn't say.
155970,L134070,u4505,m298,KANE,How old did you say you were?
155971,L134069,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Oh, me -"
155972,L134068,u4505,m298,KANE,"Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?"
155973,L134066,u4505,m298,KANE,I was only joking!  This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
155974,L134065,u4515,m298,SUSAN,I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
155975,L134064,u4505,m298,KANE,"And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?"
155976,L134063,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -"
155977,L134062,u4505,m298,KANE,"But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?"
155978,L134061,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -"
155979,L134060,u4505,m298,KANE,You really don't know who I am?
155980,L134059,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -"
155981,L134058,u4505,m298,KANE,You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
155982,L134057,u4515,m298,SUSAN,A rooster?
155983,L134056,u4505,m298,KANE,No.  But you're close.
155984,L134055,u4515,m298,SUSAN,A chicken?
155985,L134048,u4505,m298,KANE,"I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do."
155986,L134047,u4515,m298,SUSAN,I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
155987,L134046,u4505,m298,KANE,Thanks.
155988,L134045,u4515,m298,SUSAN,On the chiffonier.  Here.
155989,L134044,u4505,m298,KANE,Where's the towel?
155990,L134043,u4515,m298,SUSAN,I know...  But you do look so silly.
155991,L134042,u4505,m298,KANE,I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
155992,L134041,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Oh!
155993,L134040,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache."
155994,L134039,u4505,m298,KANE,You're very easily amused.
155995,L134038,u4515,m298,SUSAN,In the water.
155996,L134037,u4505,m298,KANE,Where's the soap?
155997,L134036,u4515,m298,SUSAN,No.  They've passed on.
155998,L134035,u4505,m298,KANE,"I'm sorry.  They live here, too?"
155999,L134034,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa."
156000,L134032,u4505,m298,KANE,Thanks.
156001,L134031,u4515,m298,SUSAN,If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
156002,L134030,u4505,m298,KANE,You're no Venus de Milo.
156003,L134029,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Oh!
156004,L134028,u4515,m298,SUSAN,You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
156005,L134027,u4505,m298,KANE,What's funny now?
156006,L134026,u4505,m298,KANE,If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
156007,L134025,u4515,m298,SUSAN,You've got some on your face.
156008,L134024,u4505,m298,KANE,Hmm!
156009,L134023,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Toothache.
156010,L134022,u4505,m298,KANE,What's the matter with you?
156011,L134021,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Ow!
156012,L133961,u4505,m298,KANE,What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
156013,L133960,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Charlie, please don't -"
156014,L133959,u4505,m298,KANE,"Get out, both of you!"
156015,L133954,u4505,m298,KANE,I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
156016,L133953,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -"
156017,L133923,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -"
156018,L133922,u4505,m298,KANE,"You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -"
156019,L133907,u4505,m298,KANE,"Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck."
156020,L133906,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -"
156021,L133964,u4505,m298,KANE,"Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -"
156022,L133963,u4514,m298,ROGERS,"You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson."
156023,L133952,u4514,m298,ROGERS,I see!
156024,L133951,u4505,m298,KANE,"Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter."
156025,L133950,u4514,m298,ROGERS,"You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -"
156026,L133930,u4514,m298,ROGERS,"Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -"
156027,L133929,u4505,m298,KANE,"You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -"
156028,L133918,u4505,m298,KANE,I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
156029,L133917,u4514,m298,ROGERS,"Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -"
156030,L133914,u4514,m298,ROGERS,"I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman."

156032,L133912,u4514,m298,ROGERS,"She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it."
156033,L133752,u4518,m298,THE PRESIDENT,"You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day."
156034,L133751,u4505,m298,KANE,"I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -"
156035,L133750,u4518,m298,THE PRESIDENT,"I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -"
156036,L133749,u4505,m298,KANE,Thanks.
156037,L133748,u4518,m298,THE PRESIDENT,"I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane."
156038,L133747,u4505,m298,KANE,It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
156039,L133746,u4518,m298,THE PRESIDENT,"I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane."
156040,L133745,u4505,m298,KANE,"I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!"
156041,L133744,u4518,m298,THE PRESIDENT,"It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?"
156042,L134102,u4505,m298,KANE,You can't.
156043,L134101,u4508,m298,MATISTI,"Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -"
156044,L134100,u4505,m298,KANE,"If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro?"
156045,L134099,u4508,m298,MATISTI,"But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -"
156046,L134098,u4505,m298,KANE,Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
156047,L134097,u4508,m298,MATISTI,Impossible!  Impossible!
156048,L133447,u4505,m298,KANE,You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
156049,L133446,u4516,m298,THATCHER,"I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?"
156050,L133443,u4505,m298,KANE,"On the other hand -  I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  I think I'm the man to do it.  You see, I have money and property -"
156051,L133442,u4516,m298,THATCHER,"Charles, my time is too valuable for me -"
156052,L133441,u4505,m298,KANE,"As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars."
156053,L133440,u4505,m298,KANE,"The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people."
156054,L133439,u4516,m298,THATCHER,They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
156055,L133438,u4505,m298,KANE,"Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?"
156056,L133436,u4505,m298,KANE,"Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?"
156057,L133435,u4516,m298,THATCHER,"I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company."
156058,L133428,u4505,m298,KANE,"I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!"
156059,L133427,u4516,m298,THATCHER,You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
156060,L133420,u4505,m298,KANE,Can you prove it isn't?
156061,L133419,u4516,m298,THATCHER,"""Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast.""  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast."
156062,L133418,u4505,m298,KANE,"I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of."
156063,L133417,u4516,m298,THATCHER,Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
156064,L133399,u4505,m298,KANE,Where'm I going?
156065,L133398,u4516,m298,THATCHER,"Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -"
156066,L133397,u4505,m298,KANE,"You goin', Mom?"
156067,L134229,u4505,m298,KANE,I didn't used to be afraid of it.
156068,L134228,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"No, I don't, Mr. Kane."
156069,L134227,u4505,m298,KANE,He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
156070,L134226,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?"
156071,L134225,u4505,m298,KANE,Persia.  It belonged to a king.
156072,L134224,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane."
156073,L134223,u4505,m298,KANE,Do you know what that is?
156074,L134222,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"Oh, yes, sir."
156075,L134221,u4505,m298,KANE,Not my wife - not either of them.
156076,L134220,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"Yes, Mr. Kane."
156077,L134219,u4505,m298,KANE,Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
156078,L134218,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"Can't say, sir."
156079,L134217,u4505,m298,KANE,"Do you like poetry, Raymond?"
156080,L134212,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"Yes, sir -"
156081,L134211,u4505,m298,KANE,Raymond -
156082,L134210,u4505,m298,KANE,Lock it - and keep it locked.
156083,L134209,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"Yes, sir."
156084,L134208,u4505,m298,KANE,"Close the door, Raymond."
156085,L134176,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane."
156086,L134175,u4505,m298,KANE,Is Mrs. Kane -
156087,L134174,u4505,m298,KANE,All right.
156088,L134173,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane."
156089,L134113,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"Yes, sir."
156090,L134112,u4505,m298,KANE,Get Dr. Corey.
156091,L133996,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking."
156092,L133995,u4505,m298,KANE,"Hello, Brad."
156093,L133842,u4507,m298,LELAND,"I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is."
156094,L133841,u4505,m298,KANE,"Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth."
156095,L133840,u4507,m298,LELAND,Yes.
156096,L133839,u4505,m298,KANE,You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
156097,L133834,u4505,m298,KANE,"Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy."
156098,L133833,u4507,m298,LELAND,I know you will.
156099,L133832,u4505,m298,KANE,"She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live."
156100,L133831,u4505,m298,KANE,"It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -"
156101,L133830,u4507,m298,LELAND,"You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!"
156102,L133829,u4505,m298,KANE,Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
156103,L133828,u4507,m298,LELAND,That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
156104,L133827,u4505,m298,KANE,You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
156105,L133826,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?"
156106,L133825,u4505,m298,KANE,Are you finished?
156107,L133824,u4507,m298,LELAND,"You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys."
156108,L133823,u4507,m298,LELAND,"You almost convince me.  I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.  I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward.  You know that.  That's why you keep me around.  You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's why you ran away from Emily.  Because you can't stand the company of your equals.  You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that."
156109,L133822,u4505,m298,KANE,"The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers."
156110,L133821,u4507,m298,LELAND,There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
156111,L133819,u4507,m298,LELAND,You might have made the whole thing less personal!
156112,L133818,u4505,m298,KANE,"Do you think the ""Enquirer"" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?"
156113,L133817,u4507,m298,LELAND,"She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you."
156114,L133816,u4505,m298,KANE,Why is she leaving me?
156115,L133815,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -"
156116,L133814,u4505,m298,KANE,"Brad, you are drunk."
156117,L133813,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -"
156118,L133812,u4507,m298,LELAND,She was going to leave you anyway -
156119,L133811,u4505,m298,KANE,"I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all."
156120,L133810,u4507,m298,LELAND,She's going to leave you -
156121,L133809,u4505,m298,KANE,All right.
156122,L133808,u4507,m298,LELAND,"No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily."
156123,L133807,u4505,m298,KANE,"I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help."
156124,L133806,u4507,m298,LELAND,I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.
156125,L133805,u4505,m298,KANE,"Why, Brad?"
156126,L133804,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago."
156127,L133802,u4505,m298,KANE,"That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?"
156128,L133801,u4507,m298,LELAND,"First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the ""Enquirer."""
156129,L133800,u4505,m298,KANE,I'll get you some coffee.
156130,L133799,u4507,m298,LELAND,I'm drunk.
156131,L133798,u4505,m298,KANE,"What's wrong, Brad?"
156132,L133797,u4507,m298,LELAND,First of all -
156133,L133786,u4505,m298,KANE,Go ahead.
156134,L133785,u4507,m298,LELAND,I'd like to talk to you about that.
156135,L133784,u4505,m298,KANE,I've got to think of Emily -
156136,L133783,u4507,m298,LELAND,What?
156137,L133782,u4505,m298,KANE,"I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her."
156138,L133781,u4507,m298,LELAND,Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
156139,L133780,u4505,m298,KANE,"What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - ""This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"""
156140,L133779,u4507,m298,LELAND,"There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it."
156141,L133778,u4507,m298,LELAND,Look out that window.
156142,L133777,u4505,m298,KANE,Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
156143,L133776,u4507,m298,LELAND,Charlie!
156144,L133775,u4505,m298,KANE,They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
156145,L133774,u4507,m298,LELAND,You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
156146,L133773,u4505,m298,KANE,I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
156147,L133772,u4507,m298,LELAND,"- and that copy of the ""Enquirer"" said the President should be killed."
156148,L133771,u4505,m298,KANE,"Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the ""Enquirer"" in his pocket?"
156149,L133770,u4507,m298,LELAND,Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
156150,L133769,u4505,m298,KANE,What do you mean by that?
156151,L133764,u4507,m298,LELAND,Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
156152,L133763,u4505,m298,KANE,Why not?
156153,L133762,u4507,m298,LELAND,Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
156154,L133761,u4505,m298,KANE,Yes?
156155,L133760,u4507,m298,LELAND,Charlie -
156156,L133759,u4505,m298,KANE,"Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  ""This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"""
156157,L133718,u4505,m298,KANE,"You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island."
156158,L133717,u4507,m298,LELAND,"It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -"
156159,L133716,u4505,m298,KANE,Yes?
156160,L133715,u4507,m298,LELAND,Charlie -
156161,L133714,u4505,m298,KANE,"You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in ""The Spring Chicken.""  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?"
156162,L133713,u4507,m298,LELAND,I'd like that.
156163,L133712,u4505,m298,KANE,You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
156164,L133711,u4507,m298,LELAND,Good.
156165,L133710,u4505,m298,KANE,I mean I've got a job for you.
156166,L133709,u4507,m298,LELAND,Yes?
156167,L133708,u4505,m298,KANE,"Say, Brad.  I've got an idea."
156168,L133700,u4505,m298,KANE,"And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?"
156169,L133699,u4507,m298,LELAND,They do it only because you do!
156170,L133698,u4505,m298,KANE,"How would the ""Enquirer"" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?"
156171,L133697,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -"
156172,L133693,u4505,m298,KANE,"All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie."
156173,L133692,u4507,m298,LELAND,"But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job."
156174,L133691,u4505,m298,KANE,"It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the ""Hickville Gazette"" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the ""Enquirer's"" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -"
156175,L133690,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country."
156176,L133689,u4505,m298,KANE,"Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?"
156177,L133619,u4505,m298,KANE,It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
156178,L133618,u4507,m298,LELAND,"The ""Chronicle"" is a good newspaper."
156179,L133609,u4505,m298,KANE,People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
156180,L133608,u4507,m298,LELAND,"That's the second sentence you've started with ""I"" -"
156181,L133602,u4507,m298,LELAND,"What're you going to do, Charlie?"
156182,L133601,u4505,m298,KANE,"I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the ""New York Enquirer"" as important to New York as the gas in that light."
156183,L133597,u4505,m298,KANE,A wasted day.
156184,L133596,u4507,m298,LELAND,It's been a tough day.
156185,L133595,u4505,m298,KANE,Tired?
156186,L133567,u4505,m298,KANE,"What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -"
156187,L133566,u4507,m298,LELAND,Poor Mr. Carter!
156188,L133875,u4505,m298,KANE,"I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state.  Well, Mr. Bernstein?"
156189,L133874,u4513,m298,REILLY,Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
156190,L133873,u4505,m298,KANE,"It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?"
156191,L133863,u4513,m298,REILLY,It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
156192,L133862,u4505,m298,KANE,"Oh, yes, the bonus."
156193,L133861,u4513,m298,REILLY,You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
156194,L133860,u4505,m298,KANE,What check?
156195,L133859,u4513,m298,REILLY,Mr. Leland sent back that check.
156196,L133858,u4505,m298,KANE,We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
156197,L133766,u4505,m298,KANE,What do you mean by that?
156198,L133765,u4513,m298,REILLY,Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
156199,L133414,u4506,m298,KANE SR.,Yes.
156200,L133413,u4509,m298,MRS. KANE,"That's what you think, is it, Jim?"
156201,L133412,u4506,m298,KANE SR.,"Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!"
156202,L133405,u4509,m298,MRS. KANE,"You won't be lonely, Charles..."
156203,L133404,u4506,m298,KANE SR.,"You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -"
156204,L133396,u4506,m298,KANE SR.,That's the train with all the lights.
156205,L133395,u4509,m298,MRS. KANE,"Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten."
156206,L133377,u4509,m298,MRS. KANE,"It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -"
156207,L133376,u4506,m298,KANE SR.,"Well, let's hope it's all for the best."
156208,L133363,u4506,m298,KANE SR.,"If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -"
156209,L133362,u4509,m298,MRS. KANE,It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
156210,L133361,u4506,m298,KANE SR.,You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
156211,L133360,u4509,m298,MRS. KANE,I'll sign those papers -
156212,L134006,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Hey, Nurse!"
156213,L134005,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to."
156214,L134004,u4507,m298,LELAND,"On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?"
156215,L134003,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,Sure.
156216,L134002,u4507,m298,LELAND,"I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow."
156217,L134001,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,That must have been love.
156218,L134000,u4507,m298,LELAND,"I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -"
156219,L133999,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,Yes.
156220,L133998,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?"
156221,L133743,u4507,m298,LELAND,"He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -"
156222,L133742,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,Was he in love?
156223,L133741,u4507,m298,LELAND,Brief marriage!  Ten years!
156224,L133740,u4507,m298,LELAND,I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
156225,L133739,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
156226,L133738,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston."
156227,L133737,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,Rawlston is my boss.
156228,L133736,u4507,m298,LELAND,"David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston -"
156229,L133735,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,It's a letter from her lawyers.
156230,L133734,u4507,m298,LELAND,What's this?
156231,L133677,u4507,m298,LELAND,"I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -"
156232,L133676,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,Maybe you could remember something that -
156233,L133675,u4507,m298,LELAND,"Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth."
156234,L133674,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Sorry, Mr. Leland."
156235,L133673,u4507,m298,LELAND,"You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?"
156236,L133672,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Mr. Leland, you were -"
156237,L133391,u4516,m298,THATCHER,"How do you do, Charles?"
156238,L133390,u4509,m298,MRS. KANE,"This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles."
156239,L133389,u4516,m298,THATCHER,"Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -"
156240,L133372,u4516,m298,THATCHER,"Right here, Mrs. Kane."
156241,L133371,u4509,m298,MRS. KANE,"Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?"
156242,L133370,u4516,m298,THATCHER,"We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner."
156243,L133369,u4509,m298,MRS. KANE,"I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim."
156244,L133367,u4516,m298,THATCHER,"The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final."
156245,L133366,u4509,m298,MRS. KANE,"I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim."
156246,L134269,u4510,m298,PHOTOGRAPHER,"Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?"
156247,L134268,u4519,m298,THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN,"Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?"
156248,L134267,u4510,m298,PHOTOGRAPHER,"Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?"
156249,L134265,u4519,m298,THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN,I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
156250,L134264,u4510,m298,PHOTOGRAPHER,Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
156251,L134257,u4510,m298,PHOTOGRAPHER,I wonder how they put all those pieces together?
156252,L134256,u4519,m298,THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN,"There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it."
156253,L134255,u4510,m298,PHOTOGRAPHER,"Yeah, all in crates."
156254,L133322,u4511,m298,RAWLSTON,Good!
156255,L133321,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston."
156256,L133320,u4511,m298,RAWLSTON,"Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -"
156257,L133319,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
156258,L133318,u4511,m298,RAWLSTON,Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
156259,L133317,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Yes, sir."
156260,L133316,u4511,m298,RAWLSTON,Thompson!
156261,L133302,u4511,m298,RAWLSTON,All we saw on that screen was a big American -
156262,L133301,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"I know, but -"
156263,L133300,u4511,m298,RAWLSTON,"Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it."
156264,L133299,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Yes, and maybe he didn't."
156265,L134246,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right."
156266,L134245,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"The banks are out of luck, eh?"
156267,L134244,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,Millions - if anybody wants it.
156268,L134243,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?"
156269,L134237,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
156270,L134236,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,You can go on asking questions if you want to.
156271,L134235,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That ""Rosebud"" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said ""Rosebud"" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him."
156272,L134234,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Well, thanks a lot."
156273,L134233,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,Yes and no.
156274,L134232,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Sentimental fellow, aren't you?"
156275,L134231,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"That's the whole works, right up to date."
156276,L134201,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,Yeah.  I guess he wasn't very happy those last years - he didn't have much reason to be -
156277,L134200,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,Queer?
156278,L134199,u4512,m298,RAYMOND,"Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him."
156279,L134197,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"I know.  If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond.  That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him.  He knows where the bodies are buried."
156280,L134196,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -"
156281,L134195,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
156282,L134194,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -"
156283,L134193,u4515,m298,SUSAN,They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
156284,L134192,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
156285,L134191,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -"
156286,L134096,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him."
156287,L134095,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,What about that apartment?
156288,L134094,u4515,m298,SUSAN,He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
156289,L134093,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"He married you, didn't he?"
156290,L134092,u4515,m298,SUSAN,I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
156291,L134091,u4515,m298,SUSAN,What do you mean?
156292,L134090,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,What did you get?
156293,L134089,u4515,m298,SUSAN,"I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -"
156294,L134016,u4515,m298,SUSAN,I had a toothache.
156295,L134015,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,How did you meet him?
156296,L134014,u4515,m298,SUSAN,You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
156297,L134013,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
156298,L134012,u4515,m298,SUSAN,How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
156299,L133334,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Get out of here!  Get out!  Get out!
156300,L133333,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you..."
156301,L133332,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
156302,L133331,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Think again!
156303,L133330,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
156304,L133329,u4515,m298,SUSAN,Who told you you could sit down here?
156305,L133344,u4517,m298,THE CAPTAIN,Rosebud?
156306,L133343,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?"
156307,L133342,u4517,m298,THE CAPTAIN,"She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner."
156308,L133341,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"She's plastered, isn't she?"
156309,L133337,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,"I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -"
156310,L133336,u4517,m298,THE CAPTAIN,"She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson."
156311,L133328,u4520,m298,THOMPSON,I'll have a highball.
156312,L133327,u4517,m298,THE CAPTAIN,"Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?"
156313,L134331,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,This? How long have you been smoking?
156314,L134330,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
156315,L134323,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,I'll just take the gum.
156316,L134322,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
156317,L134321,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Jesus!
156318,L134320,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
156319,L134319,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,It's not the same.
156320,L134318,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,"It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this."
156321,L134317,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,"Well, if it's already too late..."
156322,L134314,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
156323,L134313,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Unnhh!
156324,L134312,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
156325,L134311,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,What's this?
156326,L134310,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,You think I'm shitting you...
156327,L134309,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,You're shittin' me.
156328,L134308,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,"That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this."
156329,L134307,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,What the hell is that?
156330,L134306,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,"I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?"
156331,L134302,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,"What is this, a poll?"
156332,L134301,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,How long have you been smoking?
156333,L134300,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Are you serious?
156334,L134299,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
156335,L134298,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Am I sure about what?
156336,L134297,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,Are you sure?
156337,L134296,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Am I sure?
156338,L134295,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,Are you sure?
156339,L134363,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,"The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!"
156340,L134362,u4525,m299,DANTE,Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
156341,L134361,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,"What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!"
156342,L134360,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Yeah, but not in here."
156343,L134359,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,"We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!"
156344,L134358,u4525,m299,DANTE,"That's it, everybody out."
156345,L134353,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,"You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers."
156346,L134352,u4525,m299,DANTE,"You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance."
156347,L134351,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
156348,L134350,u4525,m299,DANTE,I think you'd better leave now.
156349,L134349,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,"Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, ""Have a nice day."""
156350,L134348,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Hey, now wait a sec..."
156351,L134329,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,Okay. I'm sorry about that.
156352,L134328,u4525,m299,DANTE,"If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers."
156353,L134327,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,"No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks."
156354,L134326,u4525,m299,DANTE,Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
156355,L134325,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
156356,L134324,u4525,m299,DANTE,Fifty-five.
156357,L134316,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,"This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?"
156358,L134315,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Excuse me, but..."
156359,L134304,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,How long have you been a smoker?
156360,L134303,u4525,m299,DANTE,Beats me.
156361,L134291,u4525,m299,DANTE,Sure. Go ahead.
156362,L134290,u4521,m299,ACTIVIST,Do you mind if I drink this here?
156363,L134289,u4525,m299,DANTE,Thanks. Have a good one.
156364,L135578,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"No, don't!"
156365,L135577,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Why?
156366,L135570,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I feel nauseous.
156367,L135569,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Nobody! I swear!
156368,L135561,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,You two better quit it.
156369,L135560,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I was here the whole time.
156370,L135555,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
156371,L135554,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work."
156372,L135553,u4535,m299,RANDAL,He was?
156373,L135552,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me."
156374,L135551,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Am I missing something here?
156375,L135533,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Awww. That was so cute.
156376,L135532,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Territoriality. He was mine first.
156377,L135531,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been."
156378,L135530,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal."
156379,L135529,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I'll try to manage.
156380,L135528,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on."
156381,L135527,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Such a sordid state of affair.
156382,L135526,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store."
156383,L135525,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,You're kidding.
156384,L135524,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night."
156385,L135523,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Why aren't there any lights?
156386,L135522,u4535,m299,RANDAL,There's no light back there.
156387,L135521,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Can I use the bathroom?
156388,L135520,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"No, this is great."
156389,L135519,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"God, isn't he great?"
156390,L135518,u4535,m299,RANDAL,He went home to change for the big date.
156391,L135517,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,So where is he?
156392,L135516,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Exactly.
156393,L135515,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Dick.
156394,L135514,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?"
156395,L135513,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
156396,L135512,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
156397,L135511,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
156398,L135510,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Can I join in?
156399,L135509,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,You can hold me down.
156400,L135508,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Can I watch?
156401,L135507,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,What can I say? He does weird things to me.
156402,L135506,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?"
156403,L135505,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,She said not to come home until graduation.
156404,L135504,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
156405,L135503,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
156406,L135502,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I take it she likes the guy.
156407,L135501,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in."
156408,L135500,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!"
156409,L135499,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
156410,L135580,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Oh God...
156411,L135579,u4525,m299,DANTE,"There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!"
156412,L135576,u4525,m299,DANTE,Call the police.
156413,L135575,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I can't believe this! I feel faint...
156414,L135572,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!"
156415,L135571,u4525,m299,DANTE,Are you sure somebody was back there?
156416,L135568,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
156417,L135567,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"This isn't fucking funny, Dante!"
156418,L135566,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
156419,L135565,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Stop this. This isn't funny.
156420,L135564,u4525,m299,DANTE,No.
156421,L135563,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
156422,L135562,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm serious.
156423,L135559,u4525,m299,DANTE,Was it you?
156424,L135558,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?"
156425,L135557,u4525,m299,DANTE,It wasn't me.
156426,L135556,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
156427,L135550,u4525,m299,DANTE,Um... okay.
156428,L135549,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
156429,L135548,u4525,m299,DANTE,Like what?
156430,L135547,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Promise me it'll always be like that.
156431,L135544,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Do you always talk weird after you violate women?
156432,L135543,u4525,m299,DANTE,I left like an hour ago.
156433,L135542,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,How'd you get here so fast?
156434,L135448,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome."
156435,L135447,u4525,m299,DANTE,What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
156436,L135446,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you."
156437,L135445,u4525,m299,DANTE,Who doesn't?
156438,L135444,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang."
156439,L135443,u4525,m299,DANTE,"He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note."
156440,L135442,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog."
156441,L135441,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
156442,L135440,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I can already tell this isn't going to work.
156443,L135439,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm just kidding.
156444,L135438,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,You're such an asshole.
156445,L135437,u4525,m299,DANTE,So what are you saying?
156446,L135436,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you."
156447,L135435,u4525,m299,DANTE,He's your fianc.
156448,L135434,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,He's not invited.
156449,L135433,u4525,m299,DANTE,Sang.
156450,L135432,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Sang.
156451,L135431,u4525,m299,DANTE,What about Sing?
156452,L135430,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words."
156453,L135429,u4525,m299,DANTE,I hear that's a rather popular date.
156454,L135428,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?"
156455,L135427,u4525,m299,DANTE,You have a better suggestion?
156456,L135426,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
156457,L135425,u4525,m299,DANTE,Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
156458,L135424,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"You mean, on a date?"
156459,L135423,u4525,m299,DANTE,Let me take you out tonight.
156460,L135422,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
156461,L135421,u4525,m299,DANTE,So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
156462,L135420,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date."
156463,L135419,u4525,m299,DANTE,Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
156464,L135418,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"You work in a market, all right."
156465,L135417,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market..."
156466,L135416,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it."
156467,L135415,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I would like to be your boyfriend, yes."
156468,L135414,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,You're serious. You want to date again.
156469,L135413,u4525,m299,DANTE,We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
156470,L135412,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
156471,L135411,u4525,m299,DANTE,But can we date?
156472,L135410,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
156473,L135409,u4525,m299,DANTE,So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
156474,L135408,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years."
156475,L135407,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Jesus, you're caustic."
156476,L135406,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?"
156477,L135405,u4525,m299,DANTE,I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
156478,L135404,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Look how full of yourself you are.
156479,L135403,u4525,m299,DANTE,You lie.
156480,L135402,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,You don't have anything to do with it.
156481,L135401,u4525,m299,DANTE,Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
156482,L135400,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?"
156483,L135399,u4525,m299,DANTE,"There's more, isn't there?"
156484,L135398,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I just told you.
156485,L135397,u4525,m299,DANTE,"If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?"
156486,L135396,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Stop it. He's a nice guy.
156487,L135395,u4525,m299,DANTE,Sang? His name is a past tense?
156488,L135394,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway..."
156489,L135393,u4525,m299,DANTE,What?
156490,L135392,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I'm giving him his ring back.
156491,L135391,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody."
156492,L135390,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people."
156493,L135389,u4525,m299,DANTE,But you were.
156494,L135388,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
156495,L135387,u4525,m299,DANTE,And you came here to what? To comfort me?
156496,L135386,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
156497,L135385,u4525,m299,DANTE,Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
156498,L135384,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Was I right?
156499,L135383,u4525,m299,DANTE,Thanks for the vote of confidence.
156500,L135382,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck."
156501,L135381,u4525,m299,DANTE,How like her.
156502,L135380,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged."
156503,L135379,u4525,m299,DANTE,"No, you're not really getting married?"
156504,L135378,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,No.
156505,L135377,u4525,m299,DANTE,So you're really getting married?
156506,L135376,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
156507,L135375,u4525,m299,DANTE,How do you know that?
156508,L135374,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby."
156509,L135373,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?"
156510,L135372,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"Well... kind of, sort of?"
156511,L135371,u4525,m299,DANTE,And you said yes?
156512,L135370,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month..."
156513,L135369,u4525,m299,DANTE,"You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend."
156514,L135368,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,"I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up."
156515,L135367,u4525,m299,DANTE,Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
156516,L135366,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I'm not pregnant.
156517,L135365,u4525,m299,DANTE,"What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?"
156518,L135364,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,It's not what you think.
156519,L135363,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Very dramatic, I thought."
156520,L135362,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,You saw it?
156521,L135361,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed."
156522,L135360,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,You're just going to lock the store like that?
156523,L135353,u4525,m299,DANTE,I can't believe you're here.
156524,L135352,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Train. It took eight hours.
156525,L135351,u4525,m299,DANTE,Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
156526,L135350,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
156527,L135349,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Dante. You've got a customer.
156528,L135348,u4525,m299,DANTE,My God. I haven't seen you since...
156529,L135347,u4522,m299,CAITLIN,Just now.
156530,L135346,u4525,m299,DANTE,When did you get back?
156531,L135611,u4525,m299,DANTE,She thought it was me.
156532,L135610,u4523,m299,CORONER,"Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?"
156533,L135609,u4525,m299,DANTE,What about Caitlin?
156534,L135606,u4523,m299,CORONER,"I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish."
156535,L135605,u4525,m299,DANTE,Well he asked me for it!
156536,L135601,u4523,m299,CORONER,No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
156537,L135600,u4525,m299,DANTE,Was he alive when... Caitlin...
156538,L135597,u4525,m299,DANTE,Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
156539,L135596,u4523,m299,CORONER,With this guy locked in?
156540,L135595,u4525,m299,DANTE,Nobody. It was closed.
156541,L135594,u4523,m299,CORONER,Then who operated the store?
156542,L135593,u4525,m299,DANTE,We did.
156543,L135592,u4523,m299,CORONER,I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
156544,L135591,u4525,m299,DANTE,Just me.
156545,L135590,u4523,m299,CORONER,Wait a second? Who was working here today?
156546,L135586,u4525,m299,DANTE,Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
156547,L135585,u4523,m299,CORONER,What time was this?
156548,L135584,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
156549,L135358,u4525,m299,DANTE,So I'm told.
156550,L135357,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
156551,L135355,u4525,m299,DANTE,"To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?"
156552,L135354,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,"Excuse me, do you have..."
156553,L135215,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,"This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!"
156554,L135214,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even."
156555,L135213,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,"Well, he missed!"
156556,L135212,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me."
156557,L135211,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
156558,L135201,u4525,m299,DANTE,They certainly do. Two fifty-five.
156559,L135200,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,"""Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase.""  They print any kind of shit in these papers."
156560,L135199,u4525,m299,DANTE,"My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working."
156561,L135194,u4525,m299,DANTE,Yes.
156562,L135193,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Are you open?
156563,L135017,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,"Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass."
156564,L135016,u4525,m299,DANTE,That's easy to say from over here.
156565,L135015,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,I can whip your ass.
156566,L135014,u4525,m299,DANTE,Like you're better!
156567,L135011,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,I'll assess all I want!
156568,L135010,u4525,m299,DANTE,Who are you to make assessments?
156569,L135009,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
156570,L135008,u4525,m299,DANTE,I can pass!
156571,L135007,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
156572,L135006,u4525,m299,DANTE,In a second!
156573,L135005,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
156574,L135001,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
156575,L135000,u4525,m299,DANTE,If you can just wait a few more minutes.
156576,L134867,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,"Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive."
156577,L134866,u4525,m299,DANTE,"We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away."
156578,L134865,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
156579,L134864,u4525,m299,DANTE,Excuse me?
156580,L134863,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,This is the last time I come to this place.
156581,L134294,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Pack of cigarettes.
156582,L134293,u4525,m299,DANTE,Yeah.
156583,L134292,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Are you open?
156584,L135730,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Oooh! Navy Seals!
156585,L135729,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor."
156586,L135628,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Yeah.
156587,L135627,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,You open?
156588,L135498,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Peptic ulcer.
156589,L135497,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Cute cat. What's his name.
156590,L135207,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?"
156591,L135206,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,"I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit."
156592,L135198,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What's your point?
156593,L135197,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Pack of cigarettes.
156594,L135185,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Annoying Customer.
156595,L135184,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
156596,L135182,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,Are you open?
156597,L135181,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
156598,L134939,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Lenin's Tomb.
156599,L134938,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,"Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?"
156600,L134934,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?"
156601,L134933,u4524,m299,CUSTOMER,This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
156602,L134932,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent."
156603,L135032,u4525,m299,DANTE,"We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!"
156604,L135031,u4536,m299,SANFORD,Shit!
156605,L135028,u4536,m299,SANFORD,I thought Redding had like three balls!
156606,L135027,u4525,m299,DANTE,You only brought one ball?!
156607,L134986,u4536,m299,SANFORD,"Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major."
156608,L134985,u4525,m299,DANTE,"All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy."
156609,L134979,u4536,m299,SANFORD,What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
156610,L134978,u4525,m299,DANTE,I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
156611,L134977,u4536,m299,SANFORD,"What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?"
156612,L134976,u4525,m299,DANTE,So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
156613,L134975,u4536,m299,SANFORD,So?
156614,L134974,u4525,m299,DANTE,"If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one."
156615,L134973,u4536,m299,SANFORD,"Dante, let me grab a Gatorade."
156616,L135792,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
156617,L135791,u4525,m299,DANTE,Get the fuck outta here already.
156618,L135790,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it."
156619,L135789,u4525,m299,DANTE,To say the least.
156620,L135788,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Helluva day.
156621,L135787,u4525,m299,DANTE,No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
156622,L135786,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain..."
156623,L135785,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'll call you. Let you know.
156624,L135784,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
156625,L135783,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
156626,L135782,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Same time. What about you?
156627,L135781,u4525,m299,DANTE,Do you work tomorrow?
156628,L135780,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Got one. Just pulled up.
156629,L135779,u4525,m299,DANTE,You need a ride?
156630,L135778,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
156631,L135777,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  ""I'm not even supposed to be here today.""  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?"
156632,L135776,u4525,m299,DANTE,"You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!"
156633,L135775,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
156634,L135774,u4525,m299,DANTE,Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
156635,L135773,u4535,m299,RANDAL,It's not like I'm miles away.
156636,L135772,u4525,m299,DANTE,Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
156637,L135771,u4535,m299,RANDAL,To talk to you.
156638,L135770,u4525,m299,DANTE,You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
156639,L135769,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Like ten after.
156640,L135768,u4525,m299,DANTE,What time did you get to work today?
156641,L135767,u4535,m299,RANDAL,How do you figure?
156642,L135766,u4525,m299,DANTE,"What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable."
156643,L135765,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?"
156644,L135764,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
156645,L135763,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Why do you say that?
156646,L135762,u4525,m299,DANTE,Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
156647,L135761,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You still didn't have to choke me.
156648,L135760,u4525,m299,DANTE,Jesus.
156649,L135759,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out."
156650,L135758,u4525,m299,DANTE,Thanks.
156651,L135757,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I thought I was doing you a favor.
156652,L135756,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
156653,L135755,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You didn't have to choke me.
156654,L135754,u4535,m299,RANDAL,It's hard to swallow.
156655,L135753,u4525,m299,DANTE,The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
156656,L135752,u4535,m299,RANDAL,How's your eye?
156657,L135666,u4525,m299,DANTE,Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
156658,L135665,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Lovely story.
156659,L135664,u4525,m299,DANTE,"My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants."
156660,L135663,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?"
156661,L135662,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Jesus H. Christ, I can't!"
156662,L135661,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Who're you kidding? You can so.
156663,L135660,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes."
156664,L135659,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Make them change.
156665,L135658,u4525,m299,DANTE,"What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change."

156667,L135656,u4525,m299,DANTE,Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
156668,L135655,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad."
156669,L135654,u4525,m299,DANTE,"You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin."

156671,L135652,u4525,m299,DANTE,...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.

156674,L135649,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!"
156675,L135648,u4525,m299,DANTE,Leave her out of this.
156676,L135647,u4535,m299,RANDAL,It's the same thing with Veronica.
156677,L135646,u4525,m299,DANTE,Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
156678,L135645,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day."

156680,L135643,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself."

156682,L135641,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?"
156683,L135640,u4525,m299,DANTE,As if it's that easy.
156684,L135639,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit."
156685,L135638,u4525,m299,DANTE,What responsibility?
156686,L135637,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is."

156688,L135635,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.

156692,L135631,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You should shit or get off the pot.
156693,L135630,u4525,m299,DANTE,I was born.
156694,L135629,u4535,m299,RANDAL,That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?

156698,L135623,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Have some chips; you'll feel better.
156699,L135622,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why do I have this life?

156702,L135619,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?

156704,L135588,u4525,m299,DANTE,What time did we go to the funeral?

156706,L135582,u4525,m299,DANTE,WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
156707,L135581,u4535,m299,RANDAL,She said she did all the work.
156708,L135574,u4525,m299,DANTE,Shut the fuck up!
156709,L135573,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You just fucked a total stranger?
156710,L135546,u4525,m299,DANTE,Could be.
156711,L135545,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
156712,L135541,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Fuck you.
156713,L135540,u4525,m299,DANTE,I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
156714,L135539,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam."
156715,L135538,u4525,m299,DANTE,There's no lights back there.
156716,L135537,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time."
156717,L135536,u4525,m299,DANTE,Who eats cock?
156718,L135496,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'll read the book.
156719,L135495,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks."
156720,L135494,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight."
156721,L135493,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
156722,L135492,u4525,m299,DANTE,"In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns."
156723,L135491,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You're a snake.
156724,L135490,u4525,m299,DANTE,"No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word."
156725,L135489,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Hey, what about Veronica?"
156726,L135488,u4525,m299,DANTE,This is my way of spitting water at life.
156727,L135487,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What happened to title dictates behavior?
156728,L135486,u4525,m299,DANTE,Watch the store while I go home and change.
156729,L135485,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
156730,L135484,u4525,m299,DANTE,"She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out."
156731,L135483,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Wow. You've had quite an evening.
156732,L135482,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm not.
156733,L135481,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You're kidding.
156734,L135480,u4525,m299,DANTE,She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
156735,L135479,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What did she say?
156736,L135478,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm not. She just left.
156737,L135477,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Now I know you're lying.
156738,L135476,u4525,m299,DANTE,No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
156739,L135475,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You're happy to get a fine?
156740,L135474,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm happy.
156741,L135473,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You're happy?
156742,L135472,u4525,m299,DANTE,Because I'm happy.
156743,L135471,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
156744,L135470,u4525,m299,DANTE,I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
156745,L135469,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You're lying.
156746,L135468,u4525,m299,DANTE,Because I'm here.
156747,L135467,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Then how come you got the fine?
156748,L135466,u4525,m299,DANTE,As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
156749,L135465,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Holy shit. That girl?
156750,L135464,u4525,m299,DANTE,Little girl. Maybe five years old?
156751,L135463,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Really?
156752,L135462,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't; you did.
156753,L135461,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
156754,L135460,u4525,m299,DANTE,Living proof.
156755,L135459,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I didn't think they even enforced this.
156756,L135458,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You're bullshitting.
156757,L135457,u4525,m299,DANTE,Five hundred dollars.
156758,L135456,u4535,m299,RANDAL,No way!
156759,L135455,u4525,m299,DANTE,I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
156760,L135454,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I like to expand my horizons.
156761,L135453,u4525,m299,DANTE,And this is what you rented?
156762,L135452,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
156763,L135451,u4525,m299,DANTE,What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
156764,L135450,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Get to work.
156765,L135225,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I know I'm your hero.
156766,L135224,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Please, get the hell out of here."
156767,L135223,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
156768,L135222,u4525,m299,DANTE,You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
156769,L135221,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?"
156770,L135220,u4525,m299,DANTE,What?
156771,L135219,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior."
156772,L135218,u4525,m299,DANTE,Jesus!
156773,L135217,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines."
156774,L135216,u4525,m299,DANTE,What the fuck did you do that for?
156775,L135209,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Not yet.
156776,L135208,u4525,m299,DANTE,That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
156777,L135205,u4525,m299,DANTE,Exactly.
156778,L135204,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?"
156779,L135203,u4525,m299,DANTE,What?
156780,L135202,u4535,m299,RANDAL,So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
156781,L135196,u4525,m299,DANTE,"It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?"
156782,L135195,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
156783,L135192,u4525,m299,DANTE,"There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store."
156784,L135191,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
156785,L135190,u4525,m299,DANTE,"We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing."
156786,L135189,u4535,m299,RANDAL,If you must.
156787,L135188,u4525,m299,DANTE,May I be blunt with you?
156788,L135187,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Let me borrow your car.
156789,L135186,u4525,m299,DANTE,Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
156790,L135180,u4525,m299,DANTE,You work in a video store!
156791,L135179,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What's that for?
156792,L135178,u4525,m299,DANTE,You want to rent a movie.
156793,L135177,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I want to rent a movie.
156794,L135176,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why should I loan you my car?
156795,L135175,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Fine. Just lend me your car.
156796,L135174,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't want to talk to you.
156797,L135173,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Let me borrow your car.
156798,L135163,u4525,m299,DANTE,Just... go! Go open the video store.
156799,L135162,u4535,m299,RANDAL,So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
156800,L135161,u4525,m299,DANTE,Her fucking body fell out!
156801,L135160,u4535,m299,RANDAL,So the casket fell over! Big deal!
156802,L135159,u4525,m299,DANTE,Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
156803,L135158,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
156804,L135157,u4525,m299,DANTE,"You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!"
156805,L135156,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!"
156806,L135155,u4525,m299,DANTE,I can't fucking believe you!!
156807,L135154,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
156808,L135153,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in."
156809,L135152,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Listen to you.
156810,L135151,u4525,m299,DANTE,I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
156811,L135149,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I never tried it.
156812,L135148,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later."
156813,L135147,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"What, your dick?"
156814,L135146,u4525,m299,DANTE,You know.
156815,L135145,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Reach what?
156816,L135144,u4525,m299,DANTE,I could never reach.
156817,L135143,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Yeah, but at what a price."
156818,L135142,u4525,m299,DANTE,"He made it, hunhh?"
156819,L135141,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Balls resting on his lips.
156820,L135140,u4525,m299,DANTE,His dick was in his mouth?
156821,L135139,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess."
156822,L135138,u4525,m299,DANTE,Who found him?
156823,L135137,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it."
156824,L135136,u4525,m299,DANTE,Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
156825,L135135,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
156826,L135134,u4525,m299,DANTE,No!
156827,L135133,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
156828,L135132,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Oh, my god."
156829,L135131,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I swear.
156830,L135130,u4525,m299,DANTE,Stop it.
156831,L135129,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Bible truth.
156832,L135128,u4525,m299,DANTE,Shut the hell up.
156833,L135127,u4535,m299,RANDAL,He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
156834,L135126,u4525,m299,DANTE,That's embarrassing?
156835,L135125,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Broke his neck.
156836,L135124,u4525,m299,DANTE,How'd he die?
156837,L135123,u4535,m299,RANDAL,That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
156838,L135122,u4525,m299,DANTE,An embarrassing way to die.
156839,L135121,u4535,m299,RANDAL,An embolism in a pool.
156840,L135120,u4525,m299,DANTE,Twenty-two; same as us.

156842,L135118,u4525,m299,DANTE,Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
156843,L135117,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You were saying?
156844,L135116,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake."
156845,L135115,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
156846,L135114,u4525,m299,DANTE,I can't close the store.
156847,L135113,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I'm going with you.
156848,L135112,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm not taking you to this funeral.
156849,L135111,u4535,m299,RANDAL,She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
156850,L135110,u4525,m299,DANTE,She meant nothing to you!
156851,L135109,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"If you go, I go."
156852,L135108,u4525,m299,DANTE,Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
156853,L135107,u4535,m299,RANDAL,But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
156854,L135106,u4525,m299,DANTE,You hate people.
156855,L135105,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
156856,L135104,u4525,m299,DANTE,Stop it. This is beneath even you.
156857,L135103,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least."
156858,L135102,u4525,m299,DANTE,You hardly knew her!
156859,L135101,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?"
156860,L135100,u4525,m299,DANTE,You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
156861,L135099,u4535,m299,RANDAL,One night only. She's buried in the morning.
156862,L135098,u4525,m299,DANTE,Shit. What about tomorrow?
156863,L135097,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
156864,L135096,u4525,m299,DANTE,What!?
156865,L135095,u4535,m299,RANDAL,It's today.
156866,L135094,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why not?
156867,L135093,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"No, you're not."
156868,L135092,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm gonna go to her wake.
156869,L135091,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You've had sex with a dead person.
156870,L135090,u4525,m299,DANTE,Number six.
156871,L135089,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?"
156872,L135088,u4525,m299,DANTE,I haven't seen her in almost two years.
156873,L135087,u4535,m299,RANDAL,She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
156874,L135086,u4525,m299,DANTE,Jesus.
156875,L135085,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
156876,L135084,u4525,m299,DANTE,How? When?
156877,L135083,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
156878,L135082,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Oh, my god."
156879,L135081,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"No, I'm serious."
156880,L135080,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Yeah, right."
156881,L135079,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Julie Dwyer died.
156882,L135078,u4525,m299,DANTE,I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
156883,L135077,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You know what Sanford told me?
156884,L135076,u4525,m299,DANTE,"""It's not like we're gonna sell out."""
156885,L135075,u4535,m299,RANDAL,After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
156886,L135074,u4525,m299,DANTE,Exactly. They drank it all.
156887,L135073,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What happened to all the Gatorade?
156888,L135072,u4525,m299,DANTE,Gatorade.
156889,L135071,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink?"
156890,L135070,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!"
156891,L135069,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
156892,L135068,u4525,m299,DANTE,One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
156893,L135067,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Helluva game!
156894,L134994,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Then where're we gonna play?
156895,L134993,u4525,m299,DANTE,We're not playing in the street.
156896,L134992,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
156897,L134991,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
156898,L134990,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Are you gonna lock the store?
156899,L134988,u4525,m299,DANTE,Can we not talk about this?
156900,L134987,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Design major.
156901,L134981,u4525,m299,DANTE,At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
156902,L134980,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"He's blunt, but he's got a point."
156903,L134972,u4525,m299,DANTE,I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
156904,L134971,u4535,m299,RANDAL,No argument here. Insubordination rules.
156905,L134970,u4525,m299,DANTE,I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
156906,L134969,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy."
156907,L134968,u4525,m299,DANTE,Pull my laces tighter.
156908,L134964,u4525,m299,DANTE,You've got a customer.
156909,L134963,u4535,m299,RANDAL,At least we're stuck here together.
156910,L134962,u4525,m299,DANTE,I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
156911,L134961,u4535,m299,RANDAL,See? There you go again.
156912,L134960,u4525,m299,DANTE,Sorry.
156913,L134959,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Don't yell at me, pal."
156914,L134958,u4525,m299,DANTE,Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
156915,L134957,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Because you buckled.
156916,L134956,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm going to miss the game.
156917,L134955,u4535,m299,RANDAL,The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
156918,L134954,u4525,m299,DANTE,You know what pisses me off the most?
156919,L134953,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt."
156920,L134952,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't back down.
156921,L134951,u4535,m299,RANDAL,That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
156922,L134950,u4525,m299,DANTE,I know.
156923,L134949,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
156924,L134948,u4525,m299,DANTE,What?
156925,L134947,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Why'd you apologize?
156926,L134946,u4525,m299,DANTE,FUCK!
156927,L134945,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"So, what-you're stuck here all day?"
156928,L134944,u4525,m299,DANTE,Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
156929,L134943,u4535,m299,RANDAL,He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
156930,L134942,u4525,m299,DANTE,Can you believe this?!
156931,L134941,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Vermont?
156932,L134937,u4525,m299,DANTE,The best Burtless movie ever made.
156933,L134936,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?"
156934,L134935,u4525,m299,DANTE,Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
156935,L134913,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal."
156936,L134912,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Thirty-seven!
156937,L134904,u4525,m299,DANTE,Veronica!
156938,L134903,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin..."
156939,L134902,u4525,m299,DANTE,Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
156940,L134901,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Why not?
156941,L134900,u4525,m299,DANTE,No.
156942,L134886,u4535,m299,RANDAL,All of them.
156943,L134885,u4525,m299,DANTE,Which ones?
156944,L134884,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
156945,L134883,u4525,m299,DANTE,The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
156946,L134882,u4535,m299,RANDAL,The milkmaids?
156947,L134881,u4525,m299,DANTE,The milkmaids.
156948,L134880,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Let's hear it.
156949,L134879,u4525,m299,DANTE,"It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings."
156950,L134878,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?"
156951,L134877,u4525,m299,DANTE,There aren't.
156952,L134876,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
156953,L134875,u4525,m299,DANTE,What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
156954,L134874,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer."
156955,L134873,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
156956,L134872,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
156957,L134871,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
156958,L134862,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away."
156959,L134861,u4525,m299,DANTE,Can we talk about this later?
156960,L134860,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life."
156961,L134859,u4525,m299,DANTE,What kind of show?
156962,L134858,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks."
156963,L134857,u4525,m299,DANTE,I guess not.
156964,L134856,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
156965,L134855,u4525,m299,DANTE,Nudie booth?
156966,L134854,u4535,m299,RANDAL,He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
156967,L134853,u4525,m299,DANTE,What's a jizz-mopper?
156968,L134852,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
156969,L134851,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie."
156970,L134833,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today."
156971,L134832,u4535,m299,RANDAL,It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
156972,L134831,u4525,m299,DANTE,He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
156973,L134830,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What did he say?
156974,L134829,u4525,m299,DANTE,I told him that and he yelled at me.
156975,L134828,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Why doesn't he just mix and match?
156976,L134827,u4525,m299,DANTE,Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
156977,L134826,u4535,m299,RANDAL,The quest isn't going well?
156978,L134825,u4525,m299,DANTE,Each egg has to be perfect.
156979,L134824,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Perfect dozen.
156980,L134823,u4525,m299,DANTE,He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
156981,L134822,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What's he looking for?
156982,L134820,u4525,m299,DANTE,This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
156983,L134819,u4535,m299,RANDAL,She's in here?
156984,L134818,u4525,m299,DANTE,Wait.
156985,L134817,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
156986,L134774,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living."
156987,L134773,u4525,m299,DANTE,"All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?"
156988,L134772,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
156989,L134771,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at."
156990,L134770,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers."
156991,L134769,u4525,m299,DANTE,So?
156992,L134768,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction."
156993,L134767,u4525,m299,DANTE,And the second time around...?
156994,L134766,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished."
156995,L134765,u4525,m299,DANTE,Basically.
156996,L134764,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials."
156997,L134763,u4525,m299,DANTE,And you figured it out?
156998,L134762,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
156999,L134761,u4525,m299,DANTE,Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
157000,L134760,u4535,m299,RANDAL,And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
157001,L134759,u4525,m299,DANTE,Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
157002,L134758,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
157003,L134757,u4525,m299,DANTE,Yeah.
157004,L134756,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"So they build another Death Star, right?"
157005,L134755,u4525,m299,DANTE,There's more?
157006,L134754,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
157007,L134751,u4525,m299,DANTE,I think they were Catholics.
157008,L134750,u4535,m299,RANDAL,The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
157009,L134749,u4525,m299,DANTE,More or less.
157010,L134748,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution."
157011,L134747,u4525,m299,DANTE,"It would stand to reason, yes."
157012,L134746,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion."
157013,L134745,u4525,m299,DANTE,Yeah.
157014,L134744,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule."
157015,L134743,u4525,m299,DANTE,I guess.
157016,L134742,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one."
157017,L134741,u4525,m299,DANTE,How do you mean?
157018,L134740,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?"
157019,L134739,u4525,m299,DANTE,The Emperor.
157020,L134738,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"All right, Vader's boss..."
157021,L134737,u4525,m299,DANTE,What's that?
157022,L134736,u4535,m299,RANDAL,There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
157023,L134735,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets."
157024,L134734,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Blasphemy.
157025,L134733,u4525,m299,DANTE,Empire.
157026,L134732,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
157027,L134731,u4525,m299,DANTE,Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
157028,L134730,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Return of the Jedi.
157029,L134729,u4525,m299,DANTE,Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
157030,L134728,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You know what I just watched?
157031,L134727,u4525,m299,DANTE,Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
157032,L134659,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc."
157033,L134658,u4525,m299,DANTE,All four?
157034,L134657,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
157035,L134656,u4525,m299,DANTE,I think it's safe to say yes.
157036,L134655,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
157037,L134654,u4525,m299,DANTE,I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
157038,L134653,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What about Veronica?
157039,L134652,u4525,m299,DANTE,...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
157040,L134651,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?"
157041,L134650,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm talking to myself here.
157042,L134649,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Oh shit, I've got to place an order."
157043,L134648,u4525,m299,DANTE,"They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone."
157044,L134647,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You think things would be any different now?
157045,L134646,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity."
157046,L134645,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Oh yeah.
157047,L134644,u4525,m299,DANTE,Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
157048,L134643,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles."
157049,L134642,u4525,m299,DANTE,It takes different strokes to move the world.
157050,L134641,u4535,m299,RANDAL,That's frightening.
157051,L134640,u4525,m299,DANTE,The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
157052,L134639,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Chess team Allan Harris?!
157053,L134638,u4525,m299,DANTE,Allan Harris.
157054,L134637,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Your mother.
157055,L134636,u4525,m299,DANTE,Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
157056,L134635,u4535,m299,RANDAL,That girl was vile to you.
157057,L134634,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Great story, isn't it?"
157058,L134633,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Oh, my God."
157059,L134632,u4525,m299,DANTE,She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
157060,L134631,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What do you mean?
157061,L134630,u4525,m299,DANTE,I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
157062,L134629,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl ""Mom."""
157063,L134628,u4525,m299,DANTE,She called me Brad.
157064,L134627,u4535,m299,RANDAL,She called you Brad?
157065,L134626,u4525,m299,DANTE,"In the middle of it, she calls me Brad."
157066,L134625,u4535,m299,RANDAL,That's cheating?
157067,L134624,u4525,m299,DANTE,Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
157068,L134623,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Eight and a half?
157069,L134622,u4525,m299,DANTE,Eight and a half.
157070,L134621,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
157071,L134620,u4525,m299,DANTE,Five years.
157072,L134619,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
157073,L134618,u4525,m299,DANTE,Seven months.
157074,L134617,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?"
157075,L134616,u4525,m299,DANTE,You win.
157076,L134615,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
157077,L134614,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction."
157078,L134613,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What do you two fight about?
157079,L134612,u4525,m299,DANTE,"One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks."
157080,L134611,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Did you tell Veronica?
157081,L134610,u4525,m299,DANTE,She called me.
157082,L134609,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You called Caitlin again?
157083,L134608,u4525,m299,DANTE,You don't want to know.
157084,L134606,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I wanted to use your car.
157085,L134605,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why?
157086,L134604,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
157087,L134603,u4525,m299,DANTE,"No, thanks."
157088,L134602,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Want something to drink? I'm buying.
157089,L134601,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
157090,L134600,u4525,m299,DANTE,Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
157091,L134599,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?"
157092,L134598,u4525,m299,DANTE,Shocking abuse of authority.
157093,L134597,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
157094,L134593,u4525,m299,DANTE,Go open the sore.
157095,L134592,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What smells like shoe polish?
157096,L134591,u4525,m299,DANTE,He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
157097,L134590,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What time do you have to stay till?
157098,L134589,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later."
157099,L134588,u4525,m299,DANTE,That's what I said.
157100,L134587,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Bunch of savages in this town.
157101,L134586,u4525,m299,DANTE,Someone jammed gum in the locks.
157102,L134585,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Why are the shutters closed?
157103,L134584,u4525,m299,DANTE,The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
157104,L134583,u4535,m299,RANDAL,What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
157105,L134582,u4525,m299,DANTE,You're late.
157106,L135308,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Jesus Christ, what next?"
157107,L135307,u4528,m299,HEATHER,"I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class."
157108,L135302,u4525,m299,DANTE,THE GLADES MOTEL?
157109,L135301,u4528,m299,HEATHER,I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
157110,L135295,u4528,m299,HEATHER,Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
157111,L135294,u4525,m299,DANTE,You know him?
157112,L135278,u4528,m299,HEATHER,Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
157113,L135277,u4525,m299,DANTE,You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
157114,L135276,u4528,m299,HEATHER,I'm her sister.
157115,L135275,u4525,m299,DANTE,Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
157116,L135274,u4528,m299,HEATHER,You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
157117,L135273,u4525,m299,DANTE,Do I know you?
157118,L135263,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't have love handles.
157119,L135262,u4528,m299,HEATHER,He's got those love handles.
157120,L135248,u4525,m299,DANTE,I know I can bench more than that!
157121,L135247,u4528,m299,HEATHER,"I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops."
157122,L135240,u4525,m299,DANTE,Thirty-fire.
157123,L135239,u4528,m299,HEATHER,Just the paper.
157124,L135238,u4525,m299,DANTE,Yes.
157125,L135237,u4528,m299,HEATHER,Are you open?
157126,L135327,u4538,m299,TRAINER,Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
157127,L135326,u4525,m299,DANTE,But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
157128,L135306,u4538,m299,TRAINER,"Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you."
157129,L135305,u4525,m299,DANTE,What? When? When did all this shit happen?
157130,L135300,u4525,m299,DANTE,I... I don't believe this...
157131,L135299,u4538,m299,TRAINER,All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
157132,L135298,u4525,m299,DANTE,Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
157133,L135291,u4538,m299,TRAINER,"While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am."
157134,L135290,u4525,m299,DANTE,What?
157135,L135287,u4538,m299,TRAINER,To you?
157136,L135286,u4525,m299,DANTE,"No, she's getting married."
157137,L135285,u4538,m299,TRAINER,"Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?"
157138,L135284,u4525,m299,DANTE,How do you know that?
157139,L135283,u4538,m299,TRAINER,And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
157140,L135282,u4525,m299,DANTE,Yeah?
157141,L135281,u4538,m299,TRAINER,"Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?"
157142,L135280,u4525,m299,DANTE,Yeah.
157143,L135279,u4538,m299,TRAINER,Did you say Caitlin Bree?
157144,L135257,u4538,m299,TRAINER,See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
157145,L135256,u4525,m299,DANTE,Oh for God's sake!
157146,L135246,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't know.
157147,L135245,u4538,m299,TRAINER,How much can you bench?
157148,L135244,u4525,m299,DANTE,I am not.
157149,L135236,u4538,m299,TRAINER,"No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise."
157150,L135235,u4525,m299,DANTE,What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
157151,L135234,u4538,m299,TRAINER,"Yes, they are. You're out of shape."
157152,L135233,u4525,m299,DANTE,They are not.
157153,L135232,u4538,m299,TRAINER,"Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized."
157154,L135231,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't think so.
157155,L135230,u4538,m299,TRAINER,I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
157156,L135229,u4525,m299,DANTE,I didn't strain. I sighed.
157157,L135228,u4538,m299,TRAINER,I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
157158,L135227,u4525,m299,DANTE,Excuse me?
157159,L135226,u4538,m299,TRAINER,Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
157160,L135713,u4531,m299,JAY,I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
157161,L135712,u4525,m299,DANTE,Meaning?
157162,L135711,u4531,m299,JAY,"I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, ""Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..."" No, wait. I fucked up. She said ""What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"""
157163,L135710,u4525,m299,DANTE,She's my girlfriend.
157164,L135709,u4531,m299,JAY,Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
157165,L135708,u4525,m299,DANTE,I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
157166,L135707,u4531,m299,JAY,"I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?"
157167,L135706,u4525,m299,DANTE,Maybe.
157168,L135705,u4531,m299,JAY,And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
157169,L135704,u4525,m299,DANTE,Lasagne.
157170,L135703,u4531,m299,JAY,Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
157171,L135702,u4525,m299,DANTE,Veronica.
157172,L135701,u4531,m299,JAY,Don't you already have a girlfriend?
157173,L135700,u4525,m299,DANTE,"We were going to start again, I think."
157174,L135699,u4531,m299,JAY,You used to go out with her?
157175,L135698,u4525,m299,DANTE,Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
157176,L135697,u4531,m299,JAY,"Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?"
157177,L135696,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't know. I wasn't watching.
157178,L135695,u4531,m299,JAY,"That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off."
157179,L135694,u4525,m299,DANTE,He died in the bathroom.
157180,L135693,u4531,m299,JAY,"Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?"
157181,L135692,u4525,m299,DANTE,I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
157182,L135691,u4531,m299,JAY,"So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like ""A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there."" That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?"
157183,L135690,u4525,m299,DANTE,So.
157184,L135689,u4531,m299,JAY,"At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax."
157185,L135688,u4525,m299,DANTE,"A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax."
157186,L135687,u4531,m299,JAY,All right. How much is Pepsi here?
157187,L135686,u4525,m299,DANTE,You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
157188,L135685,u4531,m299,JAY,What's that mean?
157189,L135684,u4525,m299,DANTE,The difference is you exploit a weakness.
157190,L135683,u4531,m299,JAY,And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
157191,L135682,u4525,m299,DANTE,It's not my store.
157192,L135681,u4531,m299,JAY,Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
157193,L135680,u4525,m299,DANTE,How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
157194,L135679,u4531,m299,JAY,"I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude."
157195,L135678,u4525,m299,DANTE,Nothing personal.
157196,L135677,u4531,m299,JAY,"Listen to you. Oh shit. ""Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."""
157197,L135676,u4525,m299,DANTE,With you? I don't think so.
157198,L135675,u4531,m299,JAY,"Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!"
157199,L135674,u4525,m299,DANTE,I should start.
157200,L135673,u4531,m299,JAY,We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
157201,L135672,u4525,m299,DANTE,A half hour.
157202,L135671,u4531,m299,JAY,Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
157203,L135670,u4525,m299,DANTE,One seventy-nine.
157204,L135669,u4531,m299,JAY,"Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs."
157205,L135668,u4525,m299,DANTE,Done poisoning the youth for the day?
157206,L135667,u4531,m299,JAY,"Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!"
157207,L135169,u4531,m299,JAY,I'm not dealing.
157208,L135168,u4525,m299,DANTE,How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
157209,L135167,u4531,m299,JAY,"Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk."
157210,L135166,u4525,m299,DANTE,Go open the video store.
157211,L135026,u4531,m299,JAY,'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!
157212,L135025,u4525,m299,DANTE,Are there any balls down there?!
157213,L134562,u4529,m299,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
157214,L134561,u4525,m299,DANTE,"If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you."
157215,L134560,u4529,m299,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,"Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too."
157216,L134559,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Actually, that's his night job."
157217,L134558,u4529,m299,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
157218,L134557,u4525,m299,DANTE,No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
157219,L134556,u4529,m299,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,You calling me a liar?
157220,L134555,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
157221,L134554,u4529,m299,IMPATIENT CUSTOMER,It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
157222,L135065,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,"Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one."
157223,L135064,u4525,m299,DANTE,Here. Now leave me alone.
157224,L135063,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
157225,L135062,u4525,m299,DANTE,The porno mags?
157226,L135061,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,"No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter."
157227,L135060,u4525,m299,DANTE,I said go ahead.
157228,L135059,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
157229,L135058,u4525,m299,DANTE,"You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there."
157230,L135057,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,"Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold."
157231,L135056,u4525,m299,DANTE,Jesus... go ahead.
157232,L135055,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,"Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on."
157233,L135054,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,"Thanks son, you're a lifesaver."
157234,L135053,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Yeah, okay. Go ahead."
157235,L135052,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,"Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough."
157236,L135051,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Yeah, but..."
157237,L135050,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,"Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff."
157238,L135049,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Actually, it is kind of rough."
157239,L135048,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
157240,L135047,u4525,m299,DANTE,The white kind.
157241,L135046,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
157242,L135045,u4525,m299,DANTE,Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
157243,L135044,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,"I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent."
157244,L135043,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Um... yeah, but it's for employees only."
157245,L135042,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,"Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?"
157246,L135041,u4525,m299,DANTE,Oh... Can I help you?
157247,L135040,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,"No, he got hit by a bus."
157248,L135039,u4525,m299,DANTE,And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
157249,L135038,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
157250,L135037,u4525,m299,DANTE,So I'm told.
157251,L135036,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
157252,L135035,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm trying.
157253,L135034,u4534,m299,OLD MAN,Be careful.
157254,L135750,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Fuck you.
157255,L135749,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Veronica, I love you..."
157256,L135748,u4540,m299,VERONICA,And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
157257,L135747,u4525,m299,DANTE,Randal...?
157258,L135746,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't."
157259,L135745,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't want to go back with her...
157260,L135744,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?"
157261,L135743,u4525,m299,DANTE,I don't want Caitlin...
157262,L135742,u4540,m299,VERONICA,You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
157263,L135741,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that..."
157264,L135740,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?"
157265,L135739,u4525,m299,DANTE,Would you let me explain...
157266,L135738,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!"
157267,L135737,u4525,m299,DANTE,A couple...?
157268,L135736,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!"
157269,L135735,u4525,m299,DANTE,It was only a few times...
157270,L135734,u4540,m299,VERONICA,You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
157271,L135733,u4525,m299,DANTE,What're you talking about?
157272,L135732,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!"
157273,L135731,u4525,m299,DANTE,What the fuck did you do that for?
157274,L134931,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne."
157275,L134930,u4525,m299,DANTE,Sure.
157276,L134929,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?"
157277,L134928,u4525,m299,DANTE,What time do you get finished?
157278,L134927,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class."
157279,L134926,u4525,m299,DANTE,I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
157280,L134925,u4540,m299,VERONICA,You couldn't get these shutters open?
157281,L134924,u4525,m299,DANTE,Thank you for the lasagne.
157282,L134923,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Thank you for being rational.
157283,L134922,u4525,m299,DANTE,...it isn't there. Yes.
157284,L134921,u4540,m299,VERONICA,The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
157285,L134920,u4525,m299,DANTE,"And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen."
157286,L134919,u4540,m299,VERONICA,And that made you feel better?
157287,L134918,u4525,m299,DANTE,At least he wasn't thirty-six.
157288,L134917,u4540,m299,VERONICA,What did he say?
157289,L134916,u4525,m299,DANTE,I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
157290,L134915,u4540,m299,VERONICA,You had to tell him.
157291,L134911,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal."
157292,L134910,u4525,m299,DANTE,Really?  You're the best.
157293,L134909,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
157294,L134908,u4525,m299,DANTE,What is it?
157295,L134907,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch."
157296,L134906,u4525,m299,DANTE,He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
157297,L134549,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Goodbye, Dante."
157298,L134548,u4525,m299,DANTE,Thirty-seven. I just can't...
157299,L134547,u4540,m299,VERONICA,I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
157300,L134546,u4525,m299,DANTE,Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
157301,L134545,u4540,m299,VERONICA,I love you. Don't feel sick.
157302,L134544,u4525,m299,DANTE,I feel sick.
157303,L134543,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved."
157304,L134542,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!"
157305,L134541,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!"
157306,L134540,u4525,m299,DANTE,A few?
157307,L134539,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Yeah, I went down on a few guys..."
157308,L134538,u4525,m299,DANTE,"No, but you sucked enough dick!"
157309,L134537,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!"
157310,L134536,u4525,m299,DANTE,Hey! Where are you going?!
157311,L134534,u4525,m299,DANTE,Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
157312,L134533,u4540,m299,VERONICA,I'm going to class.
157313,L134532,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
157314,L134531,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Um. Thirty-seven.
157315,L134530,u4525,m299,DANTE,"What the hell is that anyway, ""something like thirty-six?"" Does that include me?"
157316,L134529,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Lower your voice!
157317,L134528,u4525,m299,DANTE,WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
157318,L134527,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Something like thirty-six.
157319,L134526,u4525,m299,DANTE,Well...?
157320,L134525,u4525,m299,DANTE,This is different. This is important. How many?!
157321,L134524,u4540,m299,VERONICA,All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
157322,L134523,u4525,m299,DANTE,HOW MANY?
157323,L134522,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Let it go...
157324,L134521,u4525,m299,DANTE,How many dicks have you sucked?!
157325,L134520,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Dante...
157326,L134519,u4525,m299,DANTE,How many?
157327,L134518,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Please calm down.
157328,L134517,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said."
157329,L134516,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood."
157330,L134515,u4525,m299,DANTE,Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
157331,L134514,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
157332,L134513,u4525,m299,DANTE,Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
157333,L134512,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around."
157334,L134511,u4525,m299,DANTE,You sucked his dick!
157335,L134510,u4540,m299,VERONICA,That's because I never had sex with him!
157336,L134509,u4525,m299,DANTE,But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
157337,L134508,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
157338,L134507,u4525,m299,DANTE,You sucked that guy's dick?
157339,L134506,u4540,m299,VERONICA,I'm serious...
157340,L134505,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Yeah, right."
157341,L134504,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
157342,L134503,u4525,m299,DANTE,Like you said-she snowballed him.
157343,L134502,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Why do you say that?
157344,L134501,u4525,m299,DANTE,Sylvan can be talked into anything.
157345,L134500,u4540,m299,VERONICA,He gets off on it.
157346,L134499,u4525,m299,DANTE,He requested this?
157347,L134498,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing."
157348,L134497,u4525,m299,DANTE,What do you mean?
157349,L134496,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
157350,L134495,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why do you call him that?
157351,L134482,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes."
157352,L134481,u4525,m299,DANTE,Shit! Why are we getting up?
157353,L134480,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this."
157354,L134479,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school."
157355,L134478,u4525,m299,DANTE,Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
157356,L134477,u4540,m299,VERONICA,To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
157357,L134476,u4525,m299,DANTE,Where?
157358,L134475,u4540,m299,VERONICA,I want you to come with me on Monday.
157359,L134474,u4525,m299,DANTE,All right. Name it.
157360,L134473,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big."
157361,L134472,u4525,m299,DANTE,They put up the least amount of struggle.
157362,L134471,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
157363,L134470,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Animal, vegetable, or mineral."
157364,L134469,u4540,m299,VERONICA,I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
157365,L134468,u4525,m299,DANTE,Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
157366,L134467,u4540,m299,VERONICA,John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
157367,L134466,u4525,m299,DANTE,"No; who were the three, besides me?"
157368,L134465,u4540,m299,VERONICA,You!
157369,L134464,u4525,m299,DANTE,Who?
157370,L134463,u4540,m299,VERONICA,I'm not the pig you are.
157371,L134462,u4525,m299,DANTE,You've only had sex with three different people?
157372,L134461,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Three including you.
157373,L134460,u4525,m299,DANTE,Three?
157374,L134459,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Three.
157375,L134458,u4525,m299,DANTE,Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
157376,L134457,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
157377,L134456,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why'd you hit me?
157378,L134455,u4540,m299,VERONICA,You're a pig.
157379,L134454,u4525,m299,DANTE,What the hell was that for?
157380,L134453,u4525,m299,DANTE,Including you; yes.
157381,L134452,u4540,m299,VERONICA,You've slept with twelve different girls?
157382,L134451,u4525,m299,DANTE,Twelve.
157383,L134450,u4540,m299,VERONICA,It better be up to and including me.
157384,L134449,u4525,m299,DANTE,Including you?
157385,L134448,u4540,m299,VERONICA,We might have; I don't remember. How many?
157386,L134447,u4525,m299,DANTE,How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
157387,L134446,u4540,m299,VERONICA,How many girls have you slept with?
157388,L134445,u4525,m299,DANTE,How many what?
157389,L134444,u4540,m299,VERONICA,How many?
157390,L134443,u4525,m299,DANTE,These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
157391,L134442,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"You were making a generalization about ""broads!"""
157392,L134441,u4525,m299,DANTE,It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
157393,L134440,u4540,m299,VERONICA,I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
157394,L134439,u4525,m299,DANTE,I touched a nerve.
157395,L134438,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just ""being there""-as you put it-is not enough."
157396,L134437,u4525,m299,DANTE,Something wrong?
157397,L134436,u4540,m299,VERONICA,And I actually date you?
157398,L134435,u4525,m299,DANTE,"A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent."
157399,L134434,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"Oh, you think so?"
157400,L134433,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge."
157401,L134432,u4540,m299,VERONICA,How flattering.
157402,L134431,u4525,m299,DANTE,Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
157403,L134430,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"""Be there?"""
157404,L134429,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there."
157405,L134428,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?"
157406,L134427,u4525,m299,DANTE,How do you figure?
157407,L134426,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Typically male point of view.
157408,L134425,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me."
157409,L134424,u4540,m299,VERONICA,I was kidding.
157410,L134423,u4525,m299,DANTE,Really?
157411,L134422,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Ooh! Can we?!
157412,L134421,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why? You wanna have sex or something?
157413,L134420,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Do you think anyone can see us down here?
157414,L134419,u4525,m299,DANTE,I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
157415,L134418,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
157416,L134417,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched."
157417,L134416,u4540,m299,VERONICA,How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
157418,L134415,u4525,m299,DANTE,Why do you say that?
157419,L134414,u4540,m299,VERONICA,You're trusting.
157420,L134413,u4525,m299,DANTE,Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
157421,L134412,u4540,m299,VERONICA,How much money did you leave up there?
157422,L134406,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on."
157423,L134405,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"She called you, didn't she?"
157424,L134404,u4525,m299,DANTE,What? What is that?
157425,L134403,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged."
157426,L134402,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
157427,L134401,u4525,m299,DANTE,Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
157428,L134400,u4540,m299,VERONICA,What were you doing?
157429,L134399,u4525,m299,DANTE,Hunhh? Nothing.
157430,L134398,u4540,m299,VERONICA,What were you doing up so late?
157431,L134397,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I don't know-like two-thirty, three."
157432,L134396,u4540,m299,VERONICA,You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
157433,L134395,u4525,m299,DANTE,Bunch of savages in this town.
157434,L134394,u4540,m299,VERONICA,You're kidding.
157435,L134393,u4525,m299,DANTE,Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
157436,L134392,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
157437,L134391,u4525,m299,DANTE,"I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in."
157438,L134390,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Why did you agree to come in then?
157439,L134389,u4525,m299,DANTE,Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
157440,L134388,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Don't you have a hockey game at two?
157441,L134387,u4525,m299,DANTE,The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
157442,L134386,u4540,m299,VERONICA,I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
157443,L134385,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm not even supposed to be here today!
157444,L134384,u4540,m299,VERONICA,All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
157445,L134383,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point."
157446,L134382,u4540,m299,VERONICA,Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
157447,L134381,u4525,m299,DANTE,I hate this fucking place.
157448,L134380,u4540,m299,VERONICA,At least they weren't lit.
157449,L134379,u4525,m299,DANTE,Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
157450,L134378,u4540,m299,VERONICA,"All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?"
157451,L134725,u4525,m299,DANTE,A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
157452,L134724,u4533,m299,MAN,It stings a little.
157453,L134723,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
157454,L134722,u4533,m299,MAN,Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
157455,L134721,u4525,m299,DANTE,I think it's coming now...
157456,L134720,u4533,m299,MAN,"They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes."
157457,L134719,u4525,m299,DANTE,Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
157458,L134718,u4533,m299,MAN,Usually I just turn the can upside down.
157459,L134717,u4525,m299,DANTE,You hold the counter and I'll pull.
157460,L135325,u4537,m299,SUITED MAN,"The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day."
157461,L135324,u4525,m299,DANTE,I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
157462,L135321,u4525,m299,DANTE,But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
157463,L135320,u4537,m299,SUITED MAN,"An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child."
157464,L135319,u4525,m299,DANTE,"Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!"
157465,L135318,u4537,m299,SUITED MAN,You said you were here all day?
157466,L135317,u4525,m299,DANTE,I didn't do that!
157467,L135316,u4537,m299,SUITED MAN,"According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor."
157468,L135315,u4525,m299,DANTE,What are you talking about?
157469,L135312,u4525,m299,DANTE,WHAT?
157470,L135311,u4537,m299,SUITED MAN,"A fine, for five hundred dollars."
157471,L135310,u4525,m299,DANTE,What's this?
157472,L135309,u4537,m299,SUITED MAN,Here you go.
157473,L135270,u4525,m299,DANTE,Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
157474,L135269,u4537,m299,SUITED MAN,Can I have your name please?
157475,L135268,u4525,m299,DANTE,I'm not out of shape!
157476,L135265,u4525,m299,DANTE,I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
157477,L135264,u4537,m299,SUITED MAN,Were you working here at about four o'clock?
157478,L135261,u4525,m299,DANTE,What?
157479,L135260,u4537,m299,SUITED MAN,"Excuse me, but have you been here all day?"
157480,L135259,u4525,m299,DANTE,Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
157481,L135258,u4537,m299,SUITED MAN,You open?
157482,L134714,u4531,m299,JAY,"Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing..."
157483,L134713,u4526,m299,GIRL 1,"Did he say ""making fuck?"""
157484,L134705,u4531,m299,JAY,"You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, ""Berserker!"""
157485,L134704,u4526,m299,GIRL 1,That doesn't sound metal.
157486,L134701,u4531,m299,JAY,"I don't know, man. He's a fucking character."
157487,L134700,u4526,m299,GIRL 1,What did he say?
157488,L134696,u4531,m299,JAY,"Swear.  Olaf, metal!"
157489,L134695,u4526,m299,GIRL 1,No way!
157490,L134692,u4531,m299,JAY,"He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do."
157491,L134691,u4526,m299,GIRL 1,He only speaks Russian?
157492,L134685,u4531,m299,JAY,"I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?"
157493,L134684,u4526,m299,GIRL 1,No way.
157494,L134683,u4531,m299,JAY,"Check this out, he's from Russia."
157495,L134682,u4526,m299,GIRL 1,He's your cousin?
157496,L134681,u4531,m299,JAY,Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
157497,L134680,u4526,m299,GIRL 1,Scumbag. What are you doing?
157498,L134679,u4531,m299,JAY,"Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum."
157499,L134708,u4531,m299,JAY,"English.  Come on, ""Berserker!"" Girls think sexy."
157500,L134707,u4527,m299,GIRL 2,Does he sing in English or Russian?
157501,L134706,u4531,m299,JAY,"Come on, man, ""Berserker!"""
157502,L134703,u4531,m299,JAY,"He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called ""Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans"" or something like that."
157503,L134702,u4527,m299,GIRL 2,He really wants to play metal?
157504,L134694,u4531,m299,JAY,He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
157505,L134693,u4527,m299,GIRL 2,Is he staying here?
157506,L134688,u4531,m299,JAY,"I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?"
157507,L134687,u4527,m299,GIRL 2,What part of Russia?
157508,L135329,u4538,m299,TRAINER,I like the way you think.
157509,L135328,u4528,m299,HEATHER,Sure. How about the beach?
157510,L135323,u4528,m299,HEATHER,"That's sick, Dante."
157511,L135322,u4538,m299,TRAINER,To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
157512,L135304,u4528,m299,HEATHER,She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
157513,L135303,u4538,m299,TRAINER,Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
157514,L135297,u4528,m299,HEATHER,Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
157515,L135296,u4538,m299,TRAINER,Really?
157516,L135293,u4538,m299,TRAINER,Yeah!
157517,L135292,u4528,m299,HEATHER,Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
157518,L135289,u4538,m299,TRAINER,"Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her."
157519,L135288,u4528,m299,HEATHER,To an Asian design major.
157520,L135272,u4538,m299,TRAINER,Because he's out of shape.
157521,L135271,u4528,m299,HEATHER,You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
157522,L135267,u4528,m299,HEATHER,"Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too."
157523,L135266,u4538,m299,TRAINER,It's probably from being around all this food every day.
157524,L135255,u4538,m299,TRAINER,"Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief."
157525,L135254,u4528,m299,HEATHER,That's tight. Solid.
157526,L135253,u4538,m299,TRAINER,Feel that.
157527,L135252,u4528,m299,HEATHER,No way!
157528,L135251,u4538,m299,TRAINER,"I do about three-fifty, four."
157529,L135250,u4528,m299,HEATHER,"My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy."
157530,L135249,u4538,m299,TRAINER,I think the lady called it.
157531,L135243,u4538,m299,TRAINER,He is.
157532,L135242,u4528,m299,HEATHER,I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
157533,L135241,u4538,m299,TRAINER,Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
157534,L134814,u4530,m299,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,Screw you!
157535,L134813,u4535,m299,RANDAL,You'll be missed.
157536,L134812,u4530,m299,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
157537,L134811,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?"
157538,L134810,u4530,m299,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,You hope what feels good?
157539,L134809,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I hope it feels good.
157540,L134808,u4530,m299,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
157541,L134807,u4535,m299,RANDAL,Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
157542,L134806,u4530,m299,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,I beg your pardon!
157543,L134805,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am."
157544,L134804,u4530,m299,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,I don't think your manager would appreciate...
157545,L134803,u4535,m299,RANDAL,"No, I wasn't."
157546,L134802,u4530,m299,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
157547,L134800,u4530,m299,INDECISIVE CUSTOMER,"Well, how about these two movies?"
157548,L134799,u4535,m299,RANDAL,I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.

157730,L136966,u4546,m300,GABE,"Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?"
157731,L136960,u4552,m300,SARAH,Is it really four thousand?
157732,L136959,u4546,m300,GABE,She's tough.
157733,L136956,u4546,m300,GABE,"Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind..."
157734,L136955,u4552,m300,SARAH,"Fine, I guess..."
157735,L136954,u4546,m300,GABE,How're ya feeling?
157736,L136946,u4552,m300,SARAH,"Hi, Gabe."
157737,L136945,u4546,m300,GABE,"Room service...Hi, Sarah."
157738,L137668,u4546,m300,GABE,"And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?"
157739,L137667,u4548,m300,JESSIE,There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
157740,L137666,u4546,m300,GABE,"The ""old mouth to mouth"" resuscitation routine."
157741,L137650,u4546,m300,GABE,"RUN, DAMMIT!!"
157742,L137649,u4548,m300,JESSIE,What about you?!
157743,L137569,u4546,m300,GABE,Can't do it.  Now go back and get help!
157744,L137568,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
157745,L137567,u4546,m300,GABE,Just kidding.
157746,L137563,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone."
157747,L137562,u4546,m300,GABE,"Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience."
157748,L137561,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Forget it!  I refuse!
157749,L137560,u4546,m300,GABE,"An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall."
157750,L137559,u4548,m300,JESSIE,I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
157751,L137558,u4546,m300,GABE,Wrap it around that rock twice.
157752,L137557,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind."
157753,L137556,u4546,m300,GABE,Take the rope.
157754,L137555,u4548,m300,JESSIE,I won't do it.  No way.
157755,L137554,u4546,m300,GABE,Take the rope.
157756,L137553,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?"
157757,L137552,u4546,m300,GABE,We don't have time to argue about it!
157758,L137551,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
157759,L137550,u4546,m300,GABE,But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
157760,L137549,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind."
157761,L137548,u4546,m300,GABE,"What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it."
157762,L137547,u4548,m300,JESSIE,What about you?
157763,L137546,u4546,m300,GABE,That's exactly what I want you to do.
157764,L137545,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station."
157765,L137529,u4546,m300,GABE,"""Time is money"" -- please."
157766,L137528,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money."
157767,L137527,u4546,m300,GABE,"There's no ""we"".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face."
157768,L137526,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first."
157769,L137525,u4546,m300,GABE,Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
157770,L137516,u4546,m300,GABE,I don't know.  I don't know.
157771,L137515,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?"
157772,L137514,u4546,m300,GABE,We were going together before I ever let go of you.
157773,L137513,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Thanks for holding on.
157774,L137512,u4546,m300,GABE,"Do it, goddammit!"
157775,L137511,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Don't let me fall!
157776,L137510,u4546,m300,GABE,Reach up!  Do it!
157777,L137507,u4546,m300,GABE,Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
157778,L137506,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Gabe!
157779,L137503,u4546,m300,GABE,"Jess, c'mon..."
157780,L137502,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!"
157781,L137497,u4546,m300,GABE,Helluva time for vanity!
157782,L137496,u4548,m300,JESSIE,I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
157783,L137495,u4546,m300,GABE,"Never, what?!"
157784,L137494,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Never
157785,L137493,u4546,m300,GABE,"These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold."
157786,L137492,u4548,m300,JESSIE,This rope is sixty years old!
157787,L137491,u4546,m300,GABE,Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
157788,L137490,u4548,m300,JESSIE,What?
157789,L137489,u4546,m300,GABE,Pull it apart!
157790,L137485,u4546,m300,GABE,"Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way."
157791,L137484,u4548,m300,JESSIE,We might be able to go that way.
157792,L137475,u4546,m300,GABE,We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
157793,L137474,u4548,m300,JESSIE,They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
157794,L137470,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Get it!
157795,L137469,u4546,m300,GABE,She's a lyin' bitch!!
157796,L137464,u4546,m300,GABE,"Next time, date only basketball players."
157797,L137463,u4548,m300,JESSIE,No luck?
157798,L137431,u4546,m300,GABE,"For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up."
157799,L137430,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Gabe are you alright?
157800,L137429,u4546,m300,GABE,Up ahead.
157801,L137428,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Can you see light?
157802,L137426,u4546,m300,GABE,"No, not really.  Throw down a rope."
157803,L137425,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Gabe!  Are you alright?
157804,L137421,u4548,m300,JESSIE,If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
157805,L137420,u4546,m300,GABE,What was God thinking when he built this place?
157806,L137416,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Breathtaking.
157807,L137415,u4546,m300,GABE,"Nice view, huh?"
157808,L137408,u4546,m300,GABE,Cute.
157809,L137407,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Want me to lead?
157810,L137406,u4546,m300,GABE,A simple yes or no would have done.
157811,L137405,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you."
157812,L137404,u4546,m300,GABE,We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?
157813,L137372,u4546,m300,GABE,"Sure, just give it back when you're done."
157814,L137371,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?"
157815,L137370,u4546,m300,GABE,Yeah?
157816,L137369,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Gabe...your arm?
157817,L137368,u4546,m300,GABE,"I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it."
157818,L137367,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
157819,L137366,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"No, actually it was more like mutual attacking."
157820,L137365,u4546,m300,GABE,Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
157821,L137364,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
157822,L137363,u4546,m300,GABE,You attacked me.
157823,L137362,u4548,m300,JESSIE,It was great.
157824,L137361,u4546,m300,GABE,Of course I do.
157825,L137360,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Remember the first time we came up here?
157826,L137359,u4546,m300,GABE,Call me sentimental.
157827,L137358,u4548,m300,JESSIE,You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
157828,L137357,u4546,m300,GABE,Making things real rough for Hal.
157829,L137356,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
157830,L137355,u4546,m300,GABE,I can't believe you just said that.
157831,L137354,u4548,m300,JESSIE,I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
157832,L137353,u4546,m300,GABE,"Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place."
157833,L137336,u4546,m300,GABE,"Don't worry about me, just go."
157834,L137335,u4548,m300,JESSIE,What about you?
157835,L137334,u4546,m300,GABE,Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
157836,L137331,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"You know me, I'm a night person."
157837,L137330,u4546,m300,GABE,"They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?"
157838,L137323,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Excuse me?
157839,L137322,u4546,m300,GABE,Let's be creative.
157840,L137315,u4546,m300,GABE,"Yeah, let's go."
157841,L137314,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"For the same reason you did, to help."
157842,L137313,u4546,m300,GABE,"That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!"
157843,L137312,u4548,m300,JESSIE,I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
157844,L137311,u4546,m300,GABE,"Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie."
157845,L137309,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Where's Hal, what's going on?"
157846,L137308,u4546,m300,GABE,You got to go back now!
157847,L137307,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
157848,L137306,u4546,m300,GABE,How'd you get up here?
157849,L137305,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back."
157850,L137304,u4546,m300,GABE,What are you doing here!?
157851,L137303,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Gabe!?
157852,L137182,u4546,m300,GABE,I only came back for you.
157853,L137181,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
157854,L137180,u4546,m300,GABE,Can't do it.
157855,L137179,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--"
157856,L137178,u4548,m300,JESSIE,You mean the nerve.
157857,L137177,u4546,m300,GABE,I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
157858,L137176,u4548,m300,JESSIE,What if he can't?
157859,L137175,u4546,m300,GABE,He can handle it.
157860,L137174,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone."
157861,L137173,u4546,m300,GABE,He doesn't want my help.
157862,L137172,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks."
157863,L137171,u4546,m300,GABE,Hal knows what he's doing.
157864,L137170,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
157865,L137087,u4546,m300,GABE,Jess--you look good.
157866,L137086,u4548,m300,JESSIE,You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
157867,L137085,u4546,m300,GABE,"If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear."
157868,L137084,u4548,m300,JESSIE,And I can't leave.
157869,L137083,u4546,m300,GABE,"Like I said, I can't turn it off."
157870,L137082,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either."
157871,L137081,u4546,m300,GABE,"It doesn't matter, anywhere but here."
157872,L137080,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Where?
157873,L137079,u4546,m300,GABE,"I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else."
157874,L137078,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't."
157875,L137077,u4546,m300,GABE,"No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience."
157876,L137076,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
157877,L137075,u4546,m300,GABE,"From one professional to another, of course."
157878,L137074,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Listen to you...  The old ""mouth-to-mouth"" resuscitation routine, huh?"
157879,L137073,u4546,m300,GABE,Flare up of old emotions...
157880,L137072,u4548,m300,JESSIE,A flare up...
157881,L137071,u4546,m300,GABE,Maybe lead to a flare up...
157882,L137070,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Which could maybe what?
157883,L137069,u4546,m300,GABE,"--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe..."
157884,L137068,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Resuscitation?
157885,L137067,u4546,m300,GABE,"Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--"
157886,L137066,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?"
157887,L137065,u4546,m300,GABE,"Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--"
157888,L137064,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Did I miss something?
157889,L137063,u4546,m300,GABE,Why are you yelling?
157890,L137062,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Excuse me?
157891,L137061,u4546,m300,GABE,Why are you yelling?
157892,L137060,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>."
157893,L137059,u4546,m300,GABE,You couldn't.
157894,L137058,u4548,m300,JESSIE,I don't understand?
157895,L137057,u4546,m300,GABE,I don't expect you to understand.
157896,L137056,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better."
157897,L137055,u4546,m300,GABE,I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
157898,L137054,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?"
157899,L137053,u4546,m300,GABE,Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
157900,L137052,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
157901,L137051,u4546,m300,GABE,I don't think you do.
157902,L137050,u4548,m300,JESSIE,I know...
157903,L137049,u4546,m300,GABE,A lot of things fell apart up there.
157904,L137048,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed."
157905,L137047,u4546,m300,GABE,After the funeral I just had to leave.
157906,L137046,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason."
157907,L137045,u4546,m300,GABE,Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
157908,L137044,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Where've you been?
157909,L137043,u4546,m300,GABE,"When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble."
157910,L137042,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Hello, Gabriel."
157911,L136969,u4546,m300,GABE,"On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?"
157912,L136968,u4548,m300,JESSIE,The winds are picking up.
157913,L136944,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
157914,L136943,u4546,m300,GABE,"And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever."
157915,L136942,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Oh, please."
157916,L136941,u4546,m300,GABE,"Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber..."
157917,L136940,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Enough.
157918,L136939,u4546,m300,GABE,We spent a night there one night...
157919,L136938,u4548,m300,JESSIE,You can stop right there.
157920,L136937,u4546,m300,GABE,"The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well."
157921,L136936,u4548,m300,JESSIE,He knows it well.
157922,L136932,u4546,m300,GABE,Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
157923,L136931,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar."
157924,L136930,u4546,m300,GABE,Just hangin' out.
157925,L136929,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?"
157926,L136927,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?"
157927,L136926,u4546,m300,GABE,That's a virtue isn't it?
157928,L136925,u4548,m300,JESSIE,"Patience my love, patience."

157933,L137437,u4546,m300,GABE,I burned it.
157934,L137436,u4549,m300,KYNETTE,"Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money."
157935,L137435,u4546,m300,GABE,Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
157936,L137434,u4549,m300,KYNETTE,"Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?"
157937,L137629,u4547,m300,HAL,What are you talking about?
157938,L137628,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!"
157939,L137627,u4547,m300,HAL,"Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost."
157940,L137626,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it."
157941,L137533,u4547,m300,HAL,"When he finds the money, you're as dead as me."
157942,L137532,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"Travers, you're not running things."
157943,L137524,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go."
157944,L137523,u4547,m300,HAL,He never hurt anybody.
157945,L137410,u4547,m300,HAL,There is.
157946,L137409,u4551,m300,QUALEN,You said there was a way across.
157947,L137400,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short."

157954,L137376,u4547,m300,HAL,"It's up there, on the Tower."
157955,L137352,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?"
157956,L137351,u4547,m300,HAL,"No, he's gone."
157957,L137350,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?"
157958,L137293,u4547,m300,HAL,"The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm."
157959,L137292,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct."
157960,L137278,u4547,m300,HAL,"Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over."
157961,L137277,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call."
157962,L137264,u4547,m300,HAL,The best he can since you gave him nothing.
157963,L137263,u4551,m300,QUALEN,What's he doing?
157964,L137260,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too."
157965,L137259,u4547,m300,HAL,He'll freeze.
157966,L137251,u4547,m300,HAL,"Right, all the bullets we can eat."
157967,L137250,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be."

157973,L137378,u4553,m300,TRAVERS,"He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?"
157974,L137291,u4553,m300,TRAVERS,It looks like a winding route.
157975,L137290,u4547,m300,HAL,On top of the peak.
157976,L137282,u4547,m300,HAL,"The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out."
157977,L137281,u4553,m300,TRAVERS,Have her come up.
157978,L137239,u4553,m300,TRAVERS,"Tucker and Walker, we've lost three bags."
157979,L137238,u4547,m300,HAL,Tucker and Walker.

157996,L136993,u4547,m300,HAL,"Hold on, baby, he'll get you."
157997,L136992,u4548,m300,JESSIE,Go after her.

158009,L137601,u4553,m300,TRAVERS,"I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could."

158022,L137398,u4553,m300,TRAVERS,"You dumb bastard, you waited too long.  If he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  The way we're moving, it's going to be anyway."
158023,L137397,u4551,m300,QUALEN,"Good, Travers.  It might catch on, like shooting skeet."
158024,L137375,u4553,m300,TRAVERS,We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
158025,L137374,u4551,m300,QUALEN,Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.

158052,L137114,u4553,m300,TRAVERS,Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
158053,L137113,u4551,m300,QUALEN,Why didn't you send the money over?
158054,L137110,u4553,m300,TRAVERS,On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.

158056,L137029,u4553,m300,TRAVERS,We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
158057,L137028,u4554,m300,WRIGHT,I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.

158077,L137830,u4555,m301,ALEX,You bastards... bastards.
158078,L137829,u4560,m301,DIM,"One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing."
158079,L137780,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?"
158080,L137779,u4560,m301,DIM,"Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed."
158081,L137776,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises."
158082,L137775,u4560,m301,DIM,He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
158083,L137726,u4560,m301,DIM,"Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right."
158084,L137725,u4555,m301,ALEX,A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
158085,L137724,u4560,m301,DIM,"Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it."
158086,L137723,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish."
158087,L137722,u4560,m301,DIM,I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
158088,L137721,u4555,m301,ALEX,"For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother."
158089,L137720,u4560,m301,DIM,What did you do that for?
158090,L137719,u4555,m301,ALEX,"There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs."
158091,L137718,u4560,m301,DIM,"Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists."
158092,L137717,u4560,m301,DIM,We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
158093,L137716,u4560,m301,DIM,"Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine."
158094,L138249,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,"No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits."
158095,L138248,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way."
158096,L138247,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
158097,L138246,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,"They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,"
158098,L138245,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Who are they, sir?"
158099,L138244,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,Help you.
158100,L138243,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Help me, sir?"
158101,L138242,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,Yes. They want to help.
158102,L138241,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Phoned some friends, sir?"
158103,L138240,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,"And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath."
158104,L138239,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,"She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex."
158105,L138238,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage."
158106,L138237,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,No. She's dead!
158107,L138236,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?"
158108,L138235,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
158109,L138234,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,My wife... Alex freezes.
158110,L138233,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Thank you, sir."
158111,L138232,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
158112,L138227,u4555,m301,ALEX,"And you, sir?"
158113,L138226,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,"No, my health doesn't allow it."
158114,L138225,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Won't you join me, sir?"
158115,L138224,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned."
158116,L138223,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,Try the wine!
158117,L138222,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Great, sir. Great."
158118,L138221,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,Of course. Food alright?
158119,L138220,u4555,m301,ALEX,"It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir."
158120,L138219,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,Good evening.
158121,L138218,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Good evening, sir."
158122,L138208,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,"Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are also another kind of victim, should come here. But you're cold and shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man."
158123,L138207,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses."
158124,L138206,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
158125,L138205,u4555,m301,ALEX,"The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane."
158126,L138204,u4570,m301,MR. ALEXANDER,"Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other."
158127,L137825,u4556,m301,CATLADY,"Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion."
158128,L137824,u4555,m301,ALEX,"You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines."
158129,L137823,u4556,m301,CATLADY,No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
158130,L137822,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka."
158131,L137821,u4556,m301,CATLADY,"Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him."
158132,L137820,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?"
158133,L137819,u4556,m301,CATLADY,What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
158134,L137818,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet."
158135,L137814,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about. Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear of the house."
158136,L137813,u4556,m301,CATLADY,"I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark."
158137,L137812,u4555,m301,ALEX,"But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death."
158138,L137811,u4556,m301,CATLADY,I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
158139,L137810,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?"
158140,L138273,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook."
158141,L138272,u4561,m301,DOLIN,"Well, shall we get down to it?"
158142,L138271,u4555,m301,ALEX,"What would you like to know, sir?"
158143,L138270,u4561,m301,DOLIN,But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
158144,L138269,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Thank you very much, sir."
158145,L138268,u4561,m301,DOLIN,"Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you."
158146,L138267,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Fine, sir, fine."
158147,L138266,u4561,m301,DOLIN,Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
158148,L138265,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Much better, thank you, sir."
158149,L138264,u4561,m301,DOLIN,"Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?"
158150,L138263,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir."
158151,L138262,u4561,m301,DOLIN,I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
158152,L138261,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much."
158153,L138258,u4555,m301,ALEX,Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
158154,L138257,u4561,m301,DOLIN,Hullo.
158155,L138256,u4555,m301,ALEX,"How do you do, sir?"
158156,L138255,u4561,m301,DOLIN,So this is the young man?
158157,L138136,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee."
158158,L138135,u4565,m301,EM,"Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?"
158159,L138127,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad."
158160,L138126,u4565,m301,EM,Alex.
158161,L138125,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled."
158162,L137738,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory."
158163,L137737,u4565,m301,EM,Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
158164,L137736,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school."
158165,L137735,u4565,m301,EM,"You've not been to school all week, son."
158166,L137734,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after."
158167,L137733,u4565,m301,EM,"It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son."
158168,L137856,u4559,m301,DELTOID,It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
158169,L137855,u4555,m301,ALEX,"You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir."
158170,L137854,u4559,m301,DELTOID,I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
158171,L137853,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it."
158172,L137852,u4559,m301,DELTOID,"You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes."
158173,L137763,u4555,m301,ALEX,"As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. He groans and retches."
158174,L137762,u4559,m301,DELTOID,"That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?"
158175,L137761,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now."
158176,L137760,u4559,m301,DELTOID,"What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?"
158177,L137759,u4559,m301,DELTOID,"Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes."
158178,L137758,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed."
158179,L137757,u4559,m301,DELTOID,A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
158180,L137756,u4559,m301,DELTOID,"Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee."
158181,L137755,u4559,m301,DELTOID,"Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder."
158182,L137754,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Just a manner of speech, sir."
158183,L137753,u4559,m301,DELTOID,"Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair."
158184,L137752,u4555,m301,ALEX,"To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid ""playfully"" grabs Alex's hair."
158185,L137751,u4559,m301,DELTOID,"No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him."
158186,L137750,u4555,m301,ALEX,"A cup of the old chai, sir?"
158187,L137749,u4559,m301,DELTOID,"Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?"
158188,L137748,u4555,m301,ALEX,"A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch."
158189,L137747,u4559,m301,DELTOID,"Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?"
158190,L138290,u4573,m301,RUBINSTEIN,"Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?"
158191,L138289,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti."
158192,L138288,u4573,m301,RUBINSTEIN,Do you still feel suicidal?
158193,L138287,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits."
158194,L138286,u4573,m301,RUBINSTEIN,Do you feel that way now?
158195,L138285,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain."
158196,L138284,u4573,m301,RUBINSTEIN,I beg your pardon?
158197,L138283,u4555,m301,ALEX,"That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it."
158198,L138282,u4573,m301,RUBINSTEIN,"When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?"
158199,L138281,u4555,m301,ALEX,"That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling."
158200,L138280,u4573,m301,RUBINSTEIN,You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
158201,L138279,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th."
158202,L138278,u4573,m301,RUBINSTEIN,So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
158203,L138277,u4555,m301,ALEX,"And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven."
158204,L138276,u4573,m301,RUBINSTEIN,"It's alright, thank you."
158205,L138275,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook."
158206,L138274,u4573,m301,RUBINSTEIN,"The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music."
158207,L137806,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Tell me more, Georgie Boy."
158208,L137805,u4566,m301,GEORGIE,"It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels."
158209,L137804,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down."
158210,L137803,u4566,m301,GEORGIE,Not tonight - not this nochy.
158211,L137792,u4566,m301,GEORGIE,"Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say"
158212,L137791,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy."
158213,L137790,u4566,m301,GEORGIE,"Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast."
158214,L137789,u4555,m301,ALEX,"And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it."
158215,L137783,u4566,m301,GEORGIE,"Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each."
158216,L137782,u4555,m301,ALEX,"New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more."
158217,L137781,u4566,m301,GEORGIE,"All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way."
158218,L137778,u4555,m301,ALEX,Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
158219,L137777,u4566,m301,GEORGIE,"We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode."
158220,L138378,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Thank you, Fred. Thank you. Minister turns and signals. Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in. Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley."
158221,L138377,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends."
158222,L138376,u4555,m301,ALEX,Surprise?
158223,L138375,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you."
158224,L138374,u4555,m301,ALEX,"As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred."
158225,L138373,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?"
158226,L138372,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?"
158227,L138371,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?"
158228,L138370,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Well, who can blame them, sir?"
158229,L138369,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do."
158230,L138368,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Helping you, sir?"
158231,L138367,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us."
158232,L138366,u4555,m301,ALEX,What job and how much?
158233,L138365,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary."
158234,L138364,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Where is he now, sir?"
158235,L138363,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h"
158236,L138362,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Thank you, sir."
158237,L138361,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?"
158238,L138360,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir."
158239,L138359,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along."
158240,L138358,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain."
158241,L138351,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies."
158242,L138350,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"Good evening, my boy."
158243,L138120,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex."
158244,L138119,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?"
158245,L138118,u4569,m301,MINISTER,Good.
158246,L138117,u4555,m301,ALEX,"No, sir, I feel really great."
158247,L138116,u4569,m301,MINISTER,Not feeling too bad now are you?
158248,L138115,u4569,m301,MINISTER,Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
158249,L138114,u4555,m301,ALEX,"She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises."
158250,L138008,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy."
158251,L138007,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Thank you very much for this chance, sir."
158252,L138002,u4555,m301,ALEX,"The accidental killing of a person, sir."
158253,L138001,u4569,m301,MINISTER,What crime did you commit.
158254,L138000,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I did, sir."
158255,L137999,u4569,m301,MINISTER,Who said that?
158256,L138307,u4571,m301,PEE,"There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs."
158257,L138306,u4555,m301,ALEX,"What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her."
158258,L138161,u4571,m301,PEE,"Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?"
158259,L138160,u4555,m301,ALEX,"What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?"
158260,L138159,u4571,m301,PEE,"Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy."
158261,L138158,u4555,m301,ALEX,What about Basil? Where's my snake?
158262,L138157,u4571,m301,PEE,"Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim."
158263,L138156,u4555,m301,ALEX,"No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?"
158264,L138146,u4555,m301,ALEX,"How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?"
158265,L138145,u4571,m301,PEE,"Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe."
158266,L138144,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast."
158267,L138143,u4571,m301,PEE,"Oh, aye, aye."
158268,L138142,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Well, still the same old place then, eh?"
158269,L138141,u4571,m301,PEE,Aye.
158270,L138140,u4555,m301,ALEX,"That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed."
158271,L138134,u4571,m301,PEE,"Aye. Glad to see you back, lad."
158272,L138133,u4555,m301,ALEX,Well - I'm back.
158273,L138132,u4571,m301,PEE,"Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know."
158274,L138131,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Well, how are you then?"
158275,L138130,u4571,m301,PEE,"Fine, fine."
158276,L138129,u4555,m301,ALEX,Keeping fit then?
158277,L138128,u4571,m301,PEE,"Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you."
158278,L138111,u4555,m301,ALEX,"And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises."
158279,L138110,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
158280,L138109,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,"You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe."
158281,L138108,u4555,m301,ALEX,Let me get up.
158282,L138107,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,You wanna be sick?

158285,L138104,u4555,m301,ALEX,I'm gonna be sick.
158286,L138103,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,"... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching."
158287,L138102,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,"... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest."
158288,L138101,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
158289,L138100,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,"You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot."
158290,L138099,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you."
158291,L138098,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,"Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face."
158292,L138097,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence."
158293,L138096,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,What do I want?
158294,L138095,u4555,m301,ALEX,"No, brother. What d'you want?"
158295,L138094,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,"Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?"
158296,L138093,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning."
158297,L138092,u4568,m301,LARDFACE,"Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell."
158298,L138027,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,"Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!"
158299,L138026,u4555,m301,ALEX,"The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands."

Anything else in your pockets?"
158333,L137883,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,"Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets."

158347,L138069,u4562,m301,DR. BRANOM,"You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still."
158348,L138068,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what."
158349,L138067,u4562,m301,DR. BRANOM,"Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it."

158353,L138063,u4562,m301,DR. BRANOM,"Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon."
158354,L138053,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again."
158355,L138052,u4562,m301,DR. BRANOM,Something like that.
158356,L138051,u4555,m301,ALEX,You mean like going to the pictures?
158357,L138050,u4562,m301,DR. BRANOM,It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.

158359,L138048,u4562,m301,DR. BRANOM,"Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum."
158360,L138047,u4555,m301,ALEX,Vitamins will it be then?
158361,L138046,u4562,m301,DR. BRANOM,"Oh no, nothing of the sort."

158363,L138044,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial."
158364,L138043,u4562,m301,DR. BRANOM,"We're going to friends now, sir."
158365,L138042,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned."
158366,L138041,u4562,m301,DR. BRANOM,"Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen."

158371,L138036,u4562,m301,DR. BRANOM,"Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant."
158372,L138347,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,I'm sure it won't be long now.
158373,L138346,u4555,m301,ALEX,And when do I get out of here then?
158374,L138345,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
158375,L138344,u4555,m301,ALEX,How many did I get right?
158376,L138343,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Good. I'm glad
158377,L138342,u4555,m301,ALEX,I was quite enjoying that.
158378,L138341,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Yes.
158379,L138340,u4555,m301,ALEX,I hope so. Is that the end then?
158380,L138339,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,"Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?"
158381,L138338,u4555,m301,ALEX,Fucking hell...
158382,L138337,u4555,m301,ALEX,Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
158383,L138336,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
158384,L138335,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs."
158385,L138334,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Good. What do you want?
158386,L138333,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window."
158387,L138332,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
158388,L138331,u4555,m301,ALEX,"That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop."
158389,L138330,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
158390,L138329,u4555,m301,ALEX,Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
158391,L138328,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,"Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind."
158392,L138327,u4555,m301,ALEX,I just say what the other person would say?
158393,L138326,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Isn't the plumage beautiful?
158394,L138325,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock."
158395,L138324,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,"Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?"
158396,L138323,u4555,m301,ALEX,Oh.
158397,L138322,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
158398,L138321,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?"
158399,L138320,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Yes?
158400,L138319,u4555,m301,ALEX,Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
158401,L138318,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
158402,L138317,u4555,m301,ALEX,What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
158403,L138316,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Just part of hospital routine.
158404,L138315,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?"
158405,L138314,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,I'm your Psychiatrist.
158406,L138313,u4555,m301,ALEX,I haven't seen you before.
158407,L138312,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
158408,L138311,u4555,m301,ALEX,Fine. Fine.
158409,L138310,u4564,m301,DR. TAYLOR,How are you feeling today?
158410,L138087,u4563,m301,DR. BRODSKY,"No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man."
158411,L138086,u4555,m301,ALEX,"But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed."
158412,L138085,u4563,m301,DR. BRODSKY,You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
158413,L138084,u4563,m301,DR. BRODSKY,"You're not cured yet, my boy."
158414,L138083,u4555,m301,ALEX,"You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!"
158415,L138080,u4555,m301,ALEX,Yes!!!
158416,L138079,u4563,m301,DR. BRODSKY,You're keen on music?
158417,L138074,u4555,m301,ALEX,That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
158418,L138073,u4563,m301,DR. BRODSKY,What's all this about sin?
158419,L138062,u4555,m301,ALEX,Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
158420,L138061,u4563,m301,DR. BRODSKY,"Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket."
158421,L138176,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old men trying to get at your humble Narrator, with their feeble rookers and horny old claws. It was Old Age having a go at Youth and I daren't do a single solitary thing, O my brothers, it being better to be hit at like that, than want to be sick and feel that horrible pain. The Tramp crowd round Alex, shouting."
158422,L138175,u4574,m301,TRAMP,They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
158423,L138174,u4574,m301,TRAMP,Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
158424,L138173,u4574,m301,TRAMP,This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
158425,L138172,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps."
158426,L138171,u4574,m301,TRAMP,"I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!"
158427,L138170,u4574,m301,TRAMP,Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
158428,L138169,u4574,m301,TRAMP,"Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex."
158429,L138168,u4574,m301,TRAMP,"Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money."
158430,L137680,u4574,m301,TRAMP,It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
158431,L137679,u4555,m301,ALEX,Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
158432,L137678,u4574,m301,TRAMP,"Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this."
158433,L137677,u4574,m301,TRAMP,"Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh."
158434,L137676,u4555,m301,ALEX,"One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him."
158435,L137979,u4572,m301,PRIEST,Amen. They cross themselves.
158436,L137978,u4555,m301,ALEX,Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
158437,L137977,u4572,m301,PRIEST,"Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord."
158438,L137976,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good."
158439,L137975,u4572,m301,PRIEST,"The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man."
158440,L137974,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness."
158441,L137973,u4572,m301,PRIEST,It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
158442,L137972,u4555,m301,ALEX,"But it is being used, isn't it, Father?"
158443,L137971,u4572,m301,PRIEST,"That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment."
158444,L137970,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again."
158445,L137969,u4572,m301,PRIEST,I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
158446,L137968,u4555,m301,ALEX,"These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?"
158447,L137967,u4572,m301,PRIEST,Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
158448,L137966,u4555,m301,ALEX,"No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again."
158449,L137965,u4572,m301,PRIEST,"Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women."
158450,L137964,u4555,m301,ALEX,Father - may I ask you a question in private?
158451,L137963,u4572,m301,PRIEST,"You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform."
158452,L137962,u4555,m301,ALEX,"And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?"
158453,L137961,u4572,m301,PRIEST,Indeed.
158454,L137960,u4555,m301,ALEX,"I've done my best, have I not?"
158455,L137959,u4572,m301,PRIEST,"You have, my son."
158456,L137958,u4555,m301,ALEX,"Father, I have tried, have I not?"
158457,L137957,u4572,m301,PRIEST,"Fine, my boy, fine, fine."
158458,L137956,u4555,m301,ALEX,"If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished."
158459,L137923,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
158460,L137922,u4557,m301,CHECK-IN,"Mothballs, sir."

158462,L137918,u4557,m301,CHECK-IN,One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
158463,L137913,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
158464,L137912,u4557,m301,CHECK-IN,One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
158465,L137905,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
158466,L137904,u4557,m301,CHECK-IN,"One shirt - blue, collar attached."
158467,L137891,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,Prison custody?
158468,L137890,u4557,m301,CHECK-IN,One jacket - blue pinstripe.
158469,L138025,u4567,m301,GOVERNOR,"It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last ""i"" and smiles."
158470,L138024,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,Don't read it - sign it!
158471,L138021,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
158472,L138020,u4567,m301,GOVERNOR,"You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?"
158473,L138019,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,"Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!"
158474,L138015,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,"Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door."
158475,L138014,u4567,m301,GOVERNOR,"Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex."
158476,L138013,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,"Sir, 655321, sir."
158477,L137988,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,Sir.
158478,L137987,u4567,m301,GOVERNOR,"Carry on, Chief."
158479,L137986,u4558,m301,CHIEF GUARD,"Leave to carry on, sir, please?"
158480,L137985,u4567,m301,GOVERNOR,"Very good, Chief. They inspect cells."
158481,L138193,u4560,m301,DIM,"This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,"
158482,L138192,u4566,m301,GEORGIE,"Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through."
158483,L137794,u4566,m301,GEORGIE,"Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start."
158484,L137793,u4560,m301,DIM,Moloko-plus.

158487,L137786,u4560,m301,DIM,Yeah... Pete the English.
158488,L137785,u4566,m301,GEORGIE,And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.

158490,L138305,u4571,m301,PEE,Are you feeling better?
158491,L138304,u4565,m301,EM,"Hullo, son, how are you?"
158492,L138155,u4565,m301,EM,"Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?"
158493,L138154,u4571,m301,PEE,D'you think we should do something?
158494,L138151,u4565,m301,EM,Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
158495,L138150,u4571,m301,PEE,"Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?"
158496,L138139,u4571,m301,PEE,"Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?"
158497,L138138,u4565,m301,EM,We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
158498,L138137,u4571,m301,PEE,"Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too."
158499,L137744,u4565,m301,EM,"Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be."
158500,L137743,u4571,m301,PEE,I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
158501,L137742,u4565,m301,EM,"No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers."
158502,L137741,u4571,m301,PEE,"Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?"
158503,L138010,u4569,m301,MINISTER,Thank you.
158504,L138009,u4567,m301,GOVERNOR,Shall we go to my office?
158505,L138006,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition."
158506,L138005,u4567,m301,GOVERNOR,"Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block."
158507,L137996,u4569,m301,MINISTER,"Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by."
158508,L137995,u4567,m301,GOVERNOR,"I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money."
158509,L137994,u4569,m301,MINISTER,Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
158510,L137993,u4567,m301,GOVERNOR,"Four in this block, sir."
158511,L137992,u4569,m301,MINISTER,How many to a cell?
158512,L140724,u4584,m302,MAX,"Yes!  Stay put, goddamn it!  Don't move from that spot..."
158513,L140723,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?"
158514,L140722,u4584,m302,MAX,He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
158515,L140721,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"Seventh, files section.  What should I do?"
158516,L140720,u4584,m302,MAX,"Where are you, what floor?"
158517,L140719,u4575,m302,ANNIE,In my office?
158518,L140718,u4584,m302,MAX,...he's two floors below you.
158519,L140717,u4584,m302,MAX,"No, no, <u>wait</u>..."
158520,L140716,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building..."
158521,L140715,u4584,m302,MAX,It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
158522,L140714,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
158523,L140713,u4584,m302,MAX,"Dmitri hired him!  He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  He was stalking you when I dropped you off.  I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead."
158524,L140712,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"If this is a joke, it's not funny."
158525,L140711,u4584,m302,MAX,<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
158526,L140710,u4575,m302,ANNIE,He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
158527,L140709,u4584,m302,MAX,"Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!"
158528,L140708,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
158529,L140707,u4584,m302,MAX,"Max, the cab driver!"
158530,L140706,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Max...
158531,L140705,u4584,m302,MAX,Annie...it's Max.
158532,L140026,u4584,m302,MAX,Sure thing.
158533,L140025,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow..."
158534,L140024,u4584,m302,MAX,"Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise."
158535,L140023,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"No, no way, I couldn't take that..."
158536,L140021,u4584,m302,MAX,Dozen times a day.
158537,L140020,u4575,m302,ANNIE,How often you go?
158538,L140019,u4584,m302,MAX,Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
158539,L140018,u4575,m302,ANNIE,When was the last time you took one?
158540,L140017,u4584,m302,MAX,"Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together..."
158541,L140016,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Just had one.
158542,L140015,u4584,m302,MAX,You need a vacation.
158543,L140014,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning."
158544,L140013,u4584,m302,MAX,But not now?
158545,L140012,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Most of the time.
158546,L140011,u4584,m302,MAX,You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
158547,L140009,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Yeah.
158548,L140008,u4584,m302,MAX,Big case?
158549,L140007,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
158550,L140006,u4584,m302,MAX,"...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow."
158551,L140005,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Bottega.
158552,L140004,u4584,m302,MAX,"Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega..."
158553,L140003,u4575,m302,ANNIE,You psychic?
158554,L140002,u4584,m302,MAX,You like being a lawyer?
158555,L140001,u4584,m302,MAX,Travel...and things.
158556,L140000,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Like what?
158557,L139999,u4584,m302,MAX,This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
158558,L139998,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?"
158559,L139997,u4584,m302,MAX,There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
158560,L139996,u4575,m302,ANNIE,No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
158561,L139995,u4584,m302,MAX,It's no big deal.
158562,L139994,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics..."
158563,L139993,u4584,m302,MAX,Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
158564,L139992,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks."
158565,L139991,u4584,m302,MAX,"Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone."
158566,L139990,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
158567,L139989,u4584,m302,MAX,Let me guess.  Clarinet?
158568,L139988,u4575,m302,ANNIE,I used to play this piece back in high school.
158569,L139987,u4584,m302,MAX,You like Bach?
158570,L139985,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max."
158571,L139984,u4584,m302,MAX,No.  I got lucky with the lights.
158572,L139983,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"Go ahead, say it."
158573,L139982,u4575,m302,ANNIE,You got a deal.
158574,L139981,u4584,m302,MAX,The ride is free.
158575,L139980,u4575,m302,ANNIE,We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
158576,L139979,u4584,m302,MAX,"But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want."
158577,L139978,u4584,m302,MAX,First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
158578,L139977,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time."
158579,L139976,u4584,m302,MAX,"The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges."
158580,L139975,u4575,m302,ANNIE,Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
158581,L139974,u4584,m302,MAX,Sixth is faster.
158582,L139973,u4575,m302,ANNIE,What?
158583,L139972,u4584,m302,MAX,I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
158584,L139971,u4575,m302,ANNIE,"Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park."
158585,L139970,u4584,m302,MAX,Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
158586,L140690,u4576,m302,COP #1,You sure?  You look pretty shaky...
158587,L140689,u4584,m302,MAX,I'm...fine.  Fine.
158588,L140688,u4576,m302,COP #1,You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
158589,L140197,u4576,m302,COP #1,"Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk."
158590,L140196,u4584,m302,MAX,"Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot."
158591,L140192,u4576,m302,COP #1,"This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab."
158592,L140191,u4584,m302,MAX,I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
158593,L140190,u4576,m302,COP #1,You still carrying passengers?
158594,L140189,u4584,m302,MAX,Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
158595,L140188,u4576,m302,COP #1,A deer?
158596,L140184,u4584,m302,MAX,Yes.
158597,L140183,u4576,m302,COP #1,This your current address?
158598,L140359,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Then let's have it.
158599,L140358,u4577,m302,DANIEL,I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
158600,L140357,u4587,m302,VINCENT,It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
158601,L140356,u4577,m302,DANIEL,Lay it on me.
158602,L140355,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Of course.
158603,L140354,u4577,m302,DANIEL,One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
158604,L140351,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?"
158605,L140350,u4577,m302,DANIEL,How do I know you'll keep your word?
158606,L140349,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again."
158607,L140348,u4577,m302,DANIEL,What kind of question?
158608,L140343,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is."
158609,L140342,u4577,m302,DANIEL,And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
158610,L140341,u4587,m302,VINCENT,'Fraid so.
158611,L140340,u4577,m302,DANIEL,You know Dmitri?
158612,L140338,u4577,m302,DANIEL,"The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room."
158613,L140337,u4587,m302,VINCENT,The crowd had to dig it.
158614,L140336,u4577,m302,DANIEL,"Most vividly.  ""St. Louis Blues,"" ""Potato Head Blues,"" ""Sleepy Time Down South...""  ...then Pops laid some ""Cornet Chop Suey"" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog."
158615,L140335,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Remember what you played?
158616,L140332,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
158617,L140331,u4577,m302,DANIEL,"Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes."
158618,L140330,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Get outta here!  You and Louis?
158619,L140329,u4577,m302,DANIEL,"Oh, my, yes."
158620,L140328,u4587,m302,VINCENT,No.
158621,L140327,u4577,m302,DANIEL,Did better'n that.
158622,L140326,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
158623,L140325,u4577,m302,DANIEL,"Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling."
158624,L140324,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be..."
158625,L140323,u4577,m302,DANIEL,"He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing."
158626,L140322,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Jesus...
158627,L140321,u4577,m302,DANIEL,Right through those doors.  The man himself.
158628,L140320,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You're kidding me.
158629,L140319,u4577,m302,DANIEL,"...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong."
158630,L140576,u4584,m302,MAX,By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
158631,L140575,u4578,m302,DMITRI,Very generous.
158632,L140574,u4584,m302,MAX,"Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future."
158633,L140573,u4578,m302,DMITRI,Twenty five?
158634,L140572,u4584,m302,MAX,"As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent."
158635,L140571,u4584,m302,MAX,Wouldn't dream of it.
158636,L140570,u4578,m302,DMITRI,Vincent.  Do not cross me.
158637,L140563,u4584,m302,MAX,"In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied."
158638,L140562,u4578,m302,DMITRI,Can you finish on schedule?
158639,L140561,u4584,m302,MAX,"The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two."
158640,L140560,u4578,m302,DMITRI,Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
158641,L140559,u4584,m302,MAX,"You think I wanted to come here tonight?  You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it."
158642,L140558,u4584,m302,MAX,"You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?"
158643,L140557,u4578,m302,DMITRI,Federal?
158644,L140556,u4584,m302,MAX,I picked up a tail.
158645,L140555,u4584,m302,MAX,I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
158646,L140554,u4578,m302,DMITRI,What?  What did you say?
158647,L140553,u4584,m302,MAX,I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
158648,L140552,u4578,m302,DMITRI,What?
158649,L140551,u4584,m302,MAX,I think...
158650,L140550,u4578,m302,DMITRI,Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
158651,L140548,u4578,m302,DMITRI,"Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again."
158652,L140547,u4584,m302,MAX,Can't say that I do.
158653,L140546,u4578,m302,DMITRI,"Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?"
158654,L140545,u4578,m302,DMITRI,Sorry?
158655,L140544,u4584,m302,MAX,I'm sorry.
158656,L140543,u4578,m302,DMITRI,"I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you ""lost"" it?"
158657,L140597,u4586,m302,PEDROSA,"Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness..."
158658,L140596,u4579,m302,HELLER,What are you gonna do?
158659,L140593,u4579,m302,HELLER,I don't know...
158660,L140592,u4586,m302,PEDROSA,Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
158661,L140590,u4586,m302,PEDROSA,No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
158662,L140589,u4579,m302,HELLER,"...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?"
158663,L140588,u4586,m302,PEDROSA,So?
158664,L140587,u4579,m302,HELLER,"...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years..."
158665,L140581,u4579,m302,HELLER,Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
158666,L140580,u4586,m302,PEDROSA,"Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place..."
158667,L140565,u4579,m302,HELLER,...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
158668,L140564,u4586,m302,PEDROSA,"...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight..."
158669,L140530,u4586,m302,PEDROSA,"Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that..."
158670,L140529,u4579,m302,HELLER,Something going on?
158671,L140601,u4585,m302,MULDOON,This isn't our goddamn game!
158672,L140600,u4579,m302,HELLER,...if they're wrong?!
158673,L140599,u4585,m302,MULDOON,"Not our call, Phil."
158674,L140598,u4579,m302,HELLER,What if they're wrong?
158675,L140525,u4579,m302,HELLER,Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
158676,L140524,u4585,m302,MULDOON,"Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD."
158677,L140467,u4585,m302,MULDOON,Pick me up in five minutes.
158678,L140466,u4579,m302,HELLER,"Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there."
158679,L140465,u4585,m302,MULDOON,Jesus.  Two in one night?
158680,L140464,u4579,m302,HELLER,"Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri."
158681,L140463,u4585,m302,MULDOON,Elvis?
158682,L140462,u4579,m302,HELLER,"...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker."
158683,L140306,u4579,m302,HELLER,"Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives.  Wiseguys.  I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab."
158684,L140305,u4585,m302,MULDOON,Oh?
158685,L140304,u4579,m302,HELLER,I never bought that.
158686,L140303,u4585,m302,MULDOON,So?  It was a random thing.
158687,L140302,u4579,m302,HELLER,They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
158688,L140301,u4585,m302,MULDOON,"Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?"
158689,L140300,u4579,m302,HELLER,Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
158690,L140299,u4585,m302,MULDOON,What thing?
158691,L140298,u4579,m302,HELLER,Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
158692,L140290,u4585,m302,MULDOON,He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
158693,L140289,u4579,m302,HELLER,"There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam."
158694,L140285,u4585,m302,MULDOON,What homicide?  Phil.  Where's a body? Look.  All we got is glass...
158695,L140284,u4579,m302,HELLER,"Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours."
158696,L140283,u4585,m302,MULDOON,"Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him..."
158697,L140282,u4579,m302,HELLER,Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
158698,L140281,u4585,m302,MULDOON,You guys been holding hands?
158699,L140280,u4579,m302,HELLER,"Ivan Petrov.  Supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  I come here, find this."
158700,L140279,u4585,m302,MULDOON,"...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?"
158701,L140444,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Of course!
158702,L140443,u4580,m302,IDA,Try?
158703,L140442,u4587,m302,VINCENT,I'm in town for a short time.
158704,L140439,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Vincent...
158705,L140438,u4580,m302,IDA,What's your name?
158706,L140437,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Quite an achievement...
158707,L140433,u4580,m302,IDA,Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
158708,L140432,u4587,m302,VINCENT,I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
158709,L140427,u4580,m302,IDA,"Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy..."
158710,L140426,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
158711,L140424,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Tell me about it.
158712,L140423,u4580,m302,IDA,Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
158713,L140422,u4587,m302,VINCENT,It's nothing.
158714,L140421,u4580,m302,IDA,And you came all the way down here to see me?
158715,L140420,u4587,m302,VINCENT,I was with Max when he got the call.
158716,L140419,u4580,m302,IDA,"Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?"
158717,L140418,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke."
158718,L140415,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"No harm done, ma'am."
158719,L140414,u4580,m302,IDA,Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
158720,L140441,u4580,m302,IDA,Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
158721,L140440,u4584,m302,MAX,"I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go."
158722,L140431,u4580,m302,IDA,"Yesss, you are.  He's artistic."
158723,L140430,u4584,m302,MAX,I'm standing right here.
158724,L140429,u4580,m302,IDA,What's he sayin'?
158725,L140428,u4584,m302,MAX,"I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room."
158726,L140417,u4584,m302,MAX,"Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke."
158727,L140416,u4580,m302,IDA,"You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?"
158728,L140413,u4584,m302,MAX,He paid for 'em.
158729,L140412,u4580,m302,IDA,By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
158730,L140411,u4584,m302,MAX,You're gonna cheer up.
158731,L140410,u4580,m302,IDA,What am I gonna do with flowers?
158732,L140409,u4584,m302,MAX,I brought you flowers.
158733,L140408,u4580,m302,IDA,"You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened..."
158734,L140407,u4584,m302,MAX,I got caught up at work.
158735,L140406,u4580,m302,IDA,I've been calling and calling.
158736,L140405,u4584,m302,MAX,"Hi, Ma."
158737,L140259,u4581,m302,KID #1,"...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, <u>up</u>..."
158738,L140258,u4584,m302,MAX,"...oh God, don't shoot me..."
158739,L140257,u4584,m302,MAX,<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
158740,L140256,u4581,m302,KID #1,"I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over."
158741,L140255,u4584,m302,MAX,You're kidding me.
158742,L140251,u4584,m302,MAX,"I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere."
158743,L140250,u4581,m302,KID #1,"Yo, whassup?"
158744,L140249,u4584,m302,MAX,"Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!"
158745,L140384,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Hang on.  Carefully...
158746,L140383,u4582,m302,LENNY,"Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please."
158747,L140382,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"We're gay lovers, what's it to you?"
158748,L140381,u4582,m302,LENNY,"What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?"
158749,L140380,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
158750,L140379,u4582,m302,LENNY,Who is this?
158751,L140378,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You hassling my driver again?
158752,L140377,u4582,m302,LENNY,Maaaaaax!
158753,L140376,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Jesus, what is with this guy?"
158754,L140375,u4582,m302,LENNY,"Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit."
158755,L140240,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
158756,L140239,u4582,m302,LENNY,I was just tryin' to...to...
158757,L140238,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?"
158758,L140237,u4582,m302,LENNY,"Let's not get excited, sir."
158759,L140236,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV..."
158760,L140235,u4582,m302,LENNY,Who the hell is this?
158761,L140234,u4587,m302,VINCENT,He's not paying you one cent!
158762,L140215,u4587,m302,VINCENT,What happens if you don't?
158763,L140214,u4582,m302,LENNY,I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
158764,L140386,u4582,m302,LENNY,Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
158765,L140385,u4584,m302,MAX,Yeah?
158766,L140224,u4582,m302,LENNY,"I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!"
158767,L140223,u4584,m302,MAX,It got crashed!  I didn't...
158768,L140222,u4582,m302,LENNY,"<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it."
158769,L140221,u4584,m302,MAX,Yeah?  So?
158770,L140220,u4582,m302,LENNY,I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
158771,L140219,u4584,m302,MAX,"Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me."
158772,L140217,u4582,m302,LENNY,Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
158773,L140216,u4584,m302,MAX,He'll keep calling.
158774,L139962,u4588,m302,WOMAN,"...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift..."
158775,L139961,u4583,m302,MAN,"...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him..."
158776,L139960,u4588,m302,WOMAN,"...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing..."
158777,L139959,u4583,m302,MAN,"...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way..."
158778,L139958,u4588,m302,WOMAN,"...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it..."
158779,L139957,u4583,m302,MAN,...why is everything always about you...
158780,L140733,u4584,m302,MAX,Let her go.
158781,L140732,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Max?
158782,L140684,u4584,m302,MAX,"Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?"
158783,L140683,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Well.  That was brilliant.
158784,L140681,u4584,m302,MAX,Vincent?
158785,L140680,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Slow down!
158786,L140679,u4584,m302,MAX,"What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass."
158787,L140678,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Slow the hell down!
158788,L140675,u4584,m302,MAX,"But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way..."
158789,L140674,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You're going too fast.
158790,L140673,u4584,m302,MAX,I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
158791,L140672,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Slow down.
158792,L140671,u4584,m302,MAX,"'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves..."
158793,L140669,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"...pie in the sky?  ""Someday my dream'll come...""  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.

Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday..."
158794,L140668,u4584,m302,MAX,None of your business.
158795,L140667,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
158796,L140666,u4584,m302,MAX,Answer the question.
158797,L140665,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision..."
158798,L140664,u4584,m302,MAX,"Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  ""You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you""...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?"
158799,L140663,u4587,m302,VINCENT,As in...?
158800,L140662,u4584,m302,MAX,What happened to you?
158801,L140661,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?"

158803,L140659,u4584,m302,MAX,Then what are you?
158804,L140658,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"That's the ""why.""  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die."
158805,L140657,u4584,m302,MAX,That's the reason?
158806,L140656,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"How do I know?  But, they all got that ""witnesses for the prosecution"" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno."
158807,L140655,u4584,m302,MAX,What'd they do?
158808,L140654,u4587,m302,VINCENT,And you believe me...?
158809,L140653,u4584,m302,MAX,That's what you said...
158810,L140652,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys..."

158812,L140650,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
158813,L140649,u4584,m302,MAX,Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
158814,L140648,u4587,m302,VINCENT,There you go...!
158815,L140647,u4584,m302,MAX,One more.
158816,L140646,u4587,m302,VINCENT,How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
158817,L140645,u4584,m302,MAX,What's at Union Station?

158821,L140641,u4584,m302,MAX,"Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?"
158822,L140640,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Yeah, that."
158823,L140639,u4584,m302,MAX,"No, not just that."
158824,L140638,u4587,m302,VINCENT,I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
158825,L140637,u4584,m302,MAX,"That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me..."

158840,L140582,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there."
158841,L140518,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab."

158848,L140511,u4584,m302,MAX,How long have you been a hit man?
158849,L140510,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice."
158850,L140509,u4584,m302,MAX,Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
158851,L140508,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"That's jazz, my friend.  You said it yourself.  So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes."

158853,L140506,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
158854,L140505,u4584,m302,MAX,No.  No way.  I can't do this.
158855,L140504,u4587,m302,VINCENT,When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
158856,L140503,u4584,m302,MAX,He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
158857,L140502,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it."
158858,L140501,u4584,m302,MAX,Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
158859,L140500,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits."
158860,L140499,u4584,m302,MAX,I don't get it.
158861,L140498,u4587,m302,VINCENT,The man who hired me for this contract.
158862,L140497,u4584,m302,MAX,Dmitri?
158863,L140496,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
158864,L140495,u4584,m302,MAX,In case <u>who</u> checks?
158865,L140494,u4587,m302,VINCENT,I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
158866,L140493,u4584,m302,MAX,Why?
158867,L140492,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Gimme your wallet.
158868,L140490,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Good excuse.  How many others you got?
158869,L140489,u4584,m302,MAX,Doesn't cover everything.
158870,L140488,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"What, no insurance?"
158871,L140487,u4584,m302,MAX,"See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid."
158872,L140486,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?"
158873,L140485,u4584,m302,MAX,I told you I don't like to talk about it.
158874,L140484,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
158875,L140483,u4584,m302,MAX,"I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out..."
158876,L140482,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do."
158877,L140481,u4584,m302,MAX,It's not bullshit.
158878,L140480,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about ""my job's temporary, I got big plans,"" it's all bullshit."
158879,L140479,u4584,m302,MAX,I'm sorry.
158880,L140478,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer."
158881,L140477,u4584,m302,MAX,What happened?
158882,L140476,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily..."
158883,L140475,u4584,m302,MAX,Yeah?  What happened?
158884,L140474,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that."
158885,L140473,u4584,m302,MAX,Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
158886,L140472,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
158887,L140471,u4584,m302,MAX,"She hears what she wants to hear, okay?"
158888,L140470,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother."
158889,L140469,u4584,m302,MAX,Don't start.
158890,L140468,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Limos, huh?"
158891,L140454,u4584,m302,MAX,Jazz.
158892,L140453,u4587,m302,VINCENT,What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
158893,L140446,u4584,m302,MAX,You'd do her a favor.
158894,L140445,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"You take one more step, I'll kill her."
158895,L140435,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Oh, I'm captivated."
158896,L140434,u4584,m302,MAX,"Mom, Vincent's not interested."
158897,L140395,u4584,m302,MAX,There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
158898,L140394,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
158899,L140393,u4584,m302,MAX,What difference does it make?
158900,L140392,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You go every night?
158901,L140391,u4584,m302,MAX,She's in the hospital.
158902,L140390,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Show up for <u>what?</u>
158903,L140388,u4584,m302,MAX,"Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?"
158904,L140387,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Show up for what?
158905,L140374,u4584,m302,MAX,"Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?"
158906,L140373,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing."
158907,L140372,u4584,m302,MAX,"I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!"
158908,L140371,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
158909,L140370,u4584,m302,MAX,<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
158910,L140369,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Don't even think you're walking away from me.
158911,L140368,u4584,m302,MAX,Leave me alone.
158912,L140367,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Max?  What are you doing?
158913,L140366,u4584,m302,MAX,I'm done.  Find another cab.
158914,L140365,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"What you mean, no?"
158915,L140364,u4584,m302,MAX,No.
158916,L140363,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Let's go.
158917,L140347,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question."
158918,L140346,u4584,m302,MAX,"You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?"
158919,L140345,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You mind?  I'm working here.
158920,L140344,u4584,m302,MAX,"Let him go, Vincent."
158921,L140313,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet..."
158922,L140312,u4584,m302,MAX,I'm not catching a melody.
158923,L140311,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen..."
158924,L140310,u4584,m302,MAX,That what we're doing?  Flowing?
158925,L140309,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow."
158926,L140308,u4584,m302,MAX,I never learned jazz.
158927,L140307,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?"
158928,L140278,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
158929,L140277,u4584,m302,MAX,I listen to classical.
158930,L140276,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Jazz.  Music.
158931,L140275,u4584,m302,MAX,I'm...what?  Sorry?
158932,L140274,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?"
158933,L140272,u4584,m302,MAX,Am I collateral?
158934,L140271,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Yes, Max?"
158935,L140270,u4584,m302,MAX,Vincent?
158936,L140269,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"People in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work.  And for <u>you?</u> You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be."
158937,L140268,u4584,m302,MAX,I don't understand...
158938,L140267,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Collateral damage.
158939,L140266,u4584,m302,MAX,What?
158940,L140265,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Another collateral.
158941,L140263,u4584,m302,MAX,Yeah.
158942,L140262,u4587,m302,VINCENT,I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
158943,L140243,u4584,m302,MAX,"Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass."
158944,L140242,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass."
158945,L140241,u4584,m302,MAX,Lenny?  You're an asshole.
158946,L140232,u4587,m302,VINCENT,No you don't.
158947,L140231,u4584,m302,MAX,I need the job.
158948,L140230,u4587,m302,VINCENT,So what?
158949,L140229,u4584,m302,MAX,I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
158950,L140228,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
158951,L140226,u4584,m302,MAX,It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
158952,L140225,u4587,m302,VINCENT,It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
158953,L140213,u4584,m302,MAX,"Lenny, my dispatcher."
158954,L140212,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Who's that?
158955,L140209,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Because I have a gun and I say so.
158956,L140208,u4584,m302,MAX,Why?
158957,L140207,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed."
158958,L140180,u4584,m302,MAX,"I'll deal with it.  I will, I will..."
158959,L140179,u4587,m302,VINCENT,That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
158960,L140178,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Good luck.  You think they got families?
158961,L140177,u4584,m302,MAX,"I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them."
158962,L140176,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Believe it.
158963,L140175,u4584,m302,MAX,I can't believe this.
158964,L140174,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space."
158965,L140173,u4584,m302,MAX,Please.  Don't do anything.
158966,L140172,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
158967,L140171,u4584,m302,MAX,How?
158968,L140170,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Get rid of 'em.
158969,L140169,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies."
158970,L140168,u4584,m302,MAX,"Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage..."
158971,L140167,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise."
158972,L140166,u4584,m302,MAX,I don't know any Rwandans.
158973,L140165,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit..."
158974,L140164,u4584,m302,MAX,Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
158975,L140163,u4587,m302,VINCENT,What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
158976,L140162,u4584,m302,MAX,Who was he?
158977,L140161,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?"
158978,L140160,u4584,m302,MAX,How can you kill him like that?
158979,L140159,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
158980,L140158,u4584,m302,MAX,What'd he do to you?
158981,L140157,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"I didn't throw him, he fell."
158982,L140156,u4584,m302,MAX,I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
158983,L140155,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  ""Shit happens.""  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it."
158984,L140154,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Play music.

158990,L140147,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Tonight it is.
158991,L140146,u4584,m302,MAX,"Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks."
158992,L140145,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead."
158993,L140144,u4584,m302,MAX,You said you were visiting friends!
158994,L140143,u4587,m302,VINCENT,I told you we had other stops to make tonight.

159001,L140132,u4587,m302,VINCENT,What are you doing?
159002,L140131,u4584,m302,MAX,I think so.
159003,L140130,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You better?
159004,L140129,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps.
159005,L140128,u4584,m302,MAX,What?
159006,L140127,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Try some deep breathing.
159007,L140124,u4584,m302,MAX,"Okay, try it now."
159008,L140123,u4587,m302,VINCENT,I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.

159011,L140120,u4584,m302,MAX,I tried it.
159012,L140119,u4587,m302,VINCENT,What about that?
159013,L140118,u4584,m302,MAX,"It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!"

159032,L140095,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Did I stutter?  The trunk.  Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...
159033,L140094,u4584,m302,MAX,The trunk?
159034,L140093,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
159035,L140092,u4584,m302,MAX,With what?
159036,L140091,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Good.  Help me out here.
159037,L140090,u4584,m302,MAX,I'm cool.
159038,L140089,u4587,m302,VINCENT,No.  You say you're cool.

159040,L140087,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"You cool, Max?  Say ""I'm cool."""
159041,L140084,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him."
159042,L140083,u4584,m302,MAX,You - you killed him?
159043,L140082,u4587,m302,VINCENT,No shit.  Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
159044,L140081,u4584,m302,MAX,I think he's dead.
159045,L140080,u4584,m302,MAX,"Yeah, yeah.  Shit, man.  Guy fell on my motherfucking cab."
159046,L140079,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You always stutter?
159047,L140078,u4584,m302,MAX,He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
159048,L140075,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Max?  I'm Vincent.
159049,L140074,u4584,m302,MAX,Max.
159050,L140073,u4587,m302,VINCENT,We have a deal.  What's your name?
159051,L140071,u4587,m302,VINCENT,I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time.
159052,L140070,u4584,m302,MAX,"Two, two-fifty."
159053,L140069,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
159054,L140068,u4584,m302,MAX,I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
159055,L140067,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?"
159056,L140066,u4584,m302,MAX,Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
159057,L140065,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot..."
159058,L140064,u4587,m302,VINCENT,None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.

159061,L140061,u4584,m302,MAX,Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
159062,L140060,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Oh?  How long you been doing this?
159063,L140059,u4584,m302,MAX,Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
159064,L140058,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Why not?
159065,L140057,u4584,m302,MAX,"Me, specifically?"
159066,L140056,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You should start a union.
159067,L140055,u4584,m302,MAX,It's not that kind of job.
159068,L140054,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
159069,L140053,u4584,m302,MAX,You mean like benefits?
159070,L140052,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You on some kind of work plan?
159071,L140051,u4584,m302,MAX,"People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips."
159072,L140050,u4587,m302,VINCENT,You prefer nights?
159073,L140049,u4584,m302,MAX,Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
159074,L140048,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?"
159075,L140047,u4584,m302,MAX,I see your point.
159076,L140046,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people."
159077,L140045,u4584,m302,MAX,It's home.
159078,L140044,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?"
159079,L140043,u4584,m302,MAX,First time in New York?
159080,L140042,u4584,m302,MAX,An apology.
159081,L140041,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
159082,L140040,u4584,m302,MAX,Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
159083,L140039,u4587,m302,VINCENT,Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
159084,L140038,u4584,m302,MAX,Twenty-four minutes.
159085,L140037,u4587,m302,VINCENT,How long you think this'll take?
159086,L140032,u4584,m302,MAX,"Yeah, yeah, sorry..."
159087,L140031,u4587,m302,VINCENT,"Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?"

159094,L141869,u4589,m303,COP,They said send you downstairs.
159095,L141867,u4589,m303,COP,"Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure."
159096,L141866,u4595,m303,LIZA,What happened?
159097,L141732,u4590,m303,CYNIC,Just drop me off.

159100,L141729,u4592,m303,JERRY,I was only going one way.
159101,L141728,u4590,m303,CYNIC,You turned up a one way street!
159102,L141727,u4592,m303,JERRY,The guy came right at us!
159103,L141726,u4590,m303,CYNIC,Are you crazy?!
159104,L141725,u4592,m303,JERRY,"I, uh, I have some problems."
159105,L141724,u4590,m303,CYNIC,Why the hell not?
159106,L141723,u4592,m303,JERRY,I never told her.
159107,L141720,u4592,m303,JERRY,I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
159108,L141719,u4590,m303,CYNIC,She must be some girl.
159109,L141718,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings."
159110,L141717,u4590,m303,CYNIC,But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
159111,L141716,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down."
159112,L141715,u4590,m303,CYNIC,Geronimo?
159113,L141714,u4592,m303,JERRY,Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
159114,L141713,u4592,m303,JERRY,"I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives."
159115,L141712,u4590,m303,CYNIC,"Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit."
159116,L141711,u4592,m303,JERRY,That's love.
159117,L141710,u4590,m303,CYNIC,Excuse me?
159118,L141709,u4592,m303,JERRY,The sound of love.
159119,L142523,u4591,m303,FLIP,Shut the hell up.
159120,L142522,u4592,m303,JERRY,Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
159121,L141996,u4591,m303,FLIP,Sure was.  Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
159122,L141995,u4592,m303,JERRY,Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
159123,L141994,u4591,m303,FLIP,"Saved you last night's, too."

159127,L141742,u4591,m303,FLIP,Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.

159131,L141738,u4591,m303,FLIP,Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
159132,L141737,u4592,m303,JERRY,Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.

159134,L142504,u4592,m303,JERRY,Now she tells me.
159135,L142503,u4595,m303,LIZA,"I love you, too."

159149,L142476,u4592,m303,JERRY,I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.

159207,L142308,u4592,m303,JERRY,After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
159208,L142306,u4592,m303,JERRY,This way.
159209,L142305,u4595,m303,LIZA,Now what?
159210,L142303,u4592,m303,JERRY,Not today.
159211,L142302,u4595,m303,LIZA,We're going to Queens?
159212,L142295,u4592,m303,JERRY,There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
159213,L142294,u4595,m303,LIZA,What is it?
159214,L142293,u4592,m303,JERRY,It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
159215,L142292,u4595,m303,LIZA,"No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?"
159216,L142291,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?"
159217,L142290,u4595,m303,LIZA,Thanks.
159218,L142289,u4592,m303,JERRY,You look great.
159219,L142211,u4592,m303,JERRY,"I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?"
159220,L142210,u4595,m303,LIZA,I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
159221,L142209,u4592,m303,JERRY,"I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that."
159222,L142208,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?"
159223,L142206,u4592,m303,JERRY,It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
159224,L142205,u4595,m303,LIZA,Now's not really the time to get into this --
159225,L142204,u4592,m303,JERRY,Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
159226,L142203,u4595,m303,LIZA,Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
159227,L142202,u4592,m303,JERRY,"You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore."
159228,L142201,u4595,m303,LIZA,Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
159229,L142200,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?"
159230,L142199,u4595,m303,LIZA,If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
159231,L142198,u4592,m303,JERRY,What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
159232,L142197,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Jerry, I --"
159233,L142196,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but..."
159234,L142195,u4595,m303,LIZA,"I like you, Jerry.  A lot."
159235,L142194,u4592,m303,JERRY,I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
159236,L142193,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Those are song lyrics, Jerry."
159237,L142192,u4592,m303,JERRY,"I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic."
159238,L142191,u4595,m303,LIZA,What?
159239,L142190,u4592,m303,JERRY,I don't know what to say.  I love you.
159240,L142189,u4595,m303,LIZA,If that's what you want.  Yes.
159241,L142188,u4592,m303,JERRY,You will?
159242,L142187,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Okay, I will."
159243,L142186,u4592,m303,JERRY,They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
159244,L142185,u4595,m303,LIZA,A water main broke.
159245,L142184,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater."
159246,L142183,u4595,m303,LIZA,"They're big details, Jerry."
159247,L142182,u4592,m303,JERRY,I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
159248,L142181,u4595,m303,LIZA,"What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on."
159249,L142180,u4592,m303,JERRY,Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
159250,L142179,u4595,m303,LIZA,Where then?
159251,L142178,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport."
159252,L142177,u4595,m303,LIZA,It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
159253,L142176,u4592,m303,JERRY,Right here in Manhattan.
159254,L142175,u4595,m303,LIZA,Murdered?
159255,L142174,u4592,m303,JERRY,His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
159256,L142173,u4595,m303,LIZA,Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
159257,L142172,u4592,m303,JERRY,Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
159258,L142171,u4595,m303,LIZA,And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
159259,L142170,u4592,m303,JERRY,So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
159260,L142169,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Cold War's over, Jerry."
159261,L142168,u4592,m303,JERRY,"There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one."
159262,L142167,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Elaborate on 'they,' okay?"
159263,L142166,u4592,m303,JERRY,Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
159264,L142165,u4595,m303,LIZA,Realized what?
159265,L142164,u4592,m303,JERRY,Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
159266,L142163,u4595,m303,LIZA,I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
159267,L142162,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too."
159268,L142161,u4595,m303,LIZA,"They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke."
159269,L142160,u4592,m303,JERRY,"You haven't been bothering them, have you?"
159270,L142159,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Well, I've been tracking them down all morning."
159271,L142158,u4592,m303,JERRY,I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
159272,L142157,u4595,m303,LIZA,Where'd you get your subscribers?
159273,L142156,u4592,m303,JERRY,Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
159274,L142155,u4595,m303,LIZA,What van?
159275,L142154,u4592,m303,JERRY,Did you see the van back there?
159276,L142098,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you."
159277,L142097,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died."
159278,L142095,u4595,m303,LIZA,"You watch me, don't you?"
159279,L142094,u4592,m303,JERRY,"You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself."
159280,L142093,u4595,m303,LIZA,Not this again.
159281,L142092,u4592,m303,JERRY,He's why you punish yourself.
159282,L142091,u4595,m303,LIZA,He was murdered.
159283,L142090,u4592,m303,JERRY,How'd he die?
159284,L142089,u4595,m303,LIZA,Please put it down.
159285,L142088,u4592,m303,JERRY,Is he dead?
159286,L142087,u4595,m303,LIZA,That was him.
159287,L142086,u4592,m303,JERRY,Is this your dad?
159288,L142085,u4595,m303,LIZA,I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
159289,L142083,u4595,m303,LIZA,How is it possible?
159290,L142082,u4592,m303,JERRY,So what's the question?
159291,L142081,u4595,m303,LIZA,It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
159292,L142080,u4592,m303,JERRY,I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
159293,L142079,u4595,m303,LIZA,It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
159294,L142078,u4592,m303,JERRY,Shoot.
159295,L142077,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction."
159296,L142076,u4592,m303,JERRY,You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
159297,L142071,u4592,m303,JERRY,Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
159298,L142070,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Who are you, Jerry?"
159299,L142069,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Never, but I've been practicing."
159300,L142068,u4595,m303,LIZA,Has this happened to you before?
159301,L142067,u4592,m303,JERRY,Uh huh.
159302,L142066,u4595,m303,LIZA,Was that who I thought it was?
159303,L142062,u4592,m303,JERRY,Getting rid of my hub!
159304,L142061,u4595,m303,LIZA,What are you doing?
159305,L142054,u4592,m303,JERRY,I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
159306,L142053,u4595,m303,LIZA,"You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?"
159307,L142052,u4592,m303,JERRY,Never heard of him.
159308,L142051,u4595,m303,LIZA,Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
159309,L142050,u4592,m303,JERRY,Who?
159310,L142049,u4595,m303,LIZA,You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
159311,L142048,u4595,m303,LIZA,You got a list?
159312,L142047,u4592,m303,JERRY,Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
159313,L142046,u4595,m303,LIZA,Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
159314,L142045,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Pretty scary, huh?"
159315,L142044,u4595,m303,LIZA,"'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners.

159318,L142041,u4592,m303,JERRY,Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.

159322,L142037,u4592,m303,JERRY,I've been reading up on it.

159337,L142012,u4595,m303,LIZA,What newsletter?
159338,L142011,u4592,m303,JERRY,I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
159339,L142010,u4595,m303,LIZA,So why are they after you?
159340,L142009,u4592,m303,JERRY,I have no idea.

159343,L142006,u4592,m303,JERRY,Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
159344,L142005,u4592,m303,JERRY,"And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.

159346,L142003,u4592,m303,JERRY,More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
159347,L142002,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo..."

159349,L142000,u4592,m303,JERRY,Yeah.  I think so.
159350,L141999,u4595,m303,LIZA,You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?

159357,L141978,u4595,m303,LIZA,That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.

159374,L141961,u4592,m303,JERRY,Figure of speech.  Could we go?
159375,L141960,u4595,m303,LIZA,Don't tell me you're naked back there.

159378,L141912,u4592,m303,JERRY,Arf... You gotta help me.

159388,L141877,u4592,m303,JERRY,It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
159389,L141876,u4592,m303,JERRY,"Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?"
159390,L141875,u4595,m303,LIZA,People do have heart attacks.

159397,L141857,u4592,m303,JERRY,Switch the charts.

159408,L141787,u4595,m303,LIZA,Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
159409,L141786,u4592,m303,JERRY,What was your horse's name?

159414,L141781,u4595,m303,LIZA,I think you're different.
159415,L141780,u4592,m303,JERRY,You think I'm crazy.

159420,L141775,u4592,m303,JERRY,He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
159421,L141774,u4595,m303,LIZA,Motive?
159422,L141773,u4592,m303,JERRY,The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
159423,L141772,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?"
159424,L141771,u4592,m303,JERRY,So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
159425,L141770,u4595,m303,LIZA,Not for years.

159427,L141768,u4595,m303,LIZA,I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
159428,L141767,u4592,m303,JERRY,Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.

159430,L141765,u4592,m303,JERRY,Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
159431,L141764,u4595,m303,LIZA,I don't see the connection.
159432,L142403,u4592,m303,JERRY,Then I can't be hurt anymore.

159437,L142381,u4593,m303,JONAS,We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
159438,L141803,u4593,m303,JONAS,Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
159439,L141802,u4592,m303,JERRY,What's that?
159440,L141801,u4592,m303,JERRY,Could you be a little more specific?
159441,L141800,u4593,m303,JONAS,"Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?"
159442,L141799,u4592,m303,JERRY,That's great.  Good for you.
159443,L141798,u4593,m303,JONAS,I'm a very patient man.
159444,L141796,u4593,m303,JONAS,"Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well."
159445,L141795,u4592,m303,JERRY,Do I know you?
159446,L142521,u4592,m303,JERRY,Whatever.
159447,L142520,u4596,m303,LOWRY,Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
159448,L142519,u4592,m303,JERRY,Then screw you.  I'll rot.
159449,L142518,u4596,m303,LOWRY,I don't know...
159450,L142517,u4592,m303,JERRY,That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
159451,L142516,u4596,m303,LOWRY,We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
159452,L142515,u4592,m303,JERRY,I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
159453,L142512,u4596,m303,LOWRY,"That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy."
159454,L142511,u4592,m303,JERRY,I'm leaning toward no.
159455,L142510,u4596,m303,LOWRY,You made your decision yet?
159456,L142116,u4596,m303,LOWRY,"Well, I don't know if --"
159457,L142115,u4592,m303,JERRY,"I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?"
159458,L142114,u4596,m303,LOWRY,It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
159459,L142113,u4592,m303,JERRY,You're here because you figured I might show up.
159460,L142112,u4596,m303,LOWRY,That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
159461,L142111,u4592,m303,JERRY,You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
159462,L142110,u4596,m303,LOWRY,I'm not sure what you mean.
159463,L142109,u4592,m303,JERRY,I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
159464,L142108,u4596,m303,LOWRY,You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
159465,L142107,u4592,m303,JERRY,Thank you.
159466,L142282,u4593,m303,JONAS,I want this box rigged with a beacon!
159467,L142281,u4595,m303,LIZA,It's okay.  I'm game.

159471,L142264,u4593,m303,JONAS,Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
159472,L142263,u4595,m303,LIZA,Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
159473,L142262,u4593,m303,JONAS,I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
159474,L142261,u4595,m303,LIZA,It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
159475,L142260,u4593,m303,JONAS,You do recognize it then?
159476,L142259,u4595,m303,LIZA,Where'd you get it?
159477,L142257,u4593,m303,JONAS,So you'll believe what I tell you next.  Because I need to find Jerry.  And I don't think I can do that without you.
159478,L142256,u4595,m303,LIZA,"If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?"
159479,L142255,u4593,m303,JONAS,Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
159480,L142254,u4595,m303,LIZA,I don't believe you.
159481,L142253,u4593,m303,JONAS,Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --

159483,L142248,u4593,m303,JONAS,"Yes, that's right."
159484,L142247,u4595,m303,LIZA,These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
159485,L142246,u4593,m303,JONAS,<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
159486,L142245,u4595,m303,LIZA,A dog.
159487,L142244,u4593,m303,JONAS,And what did I say?
159488,L142243,u4595,m303,LIZA,Jerry told me he bit your nose.
159489,L142242,u4593,m303,JONAS,It was.  It was.
159490,L142241,u4595,m303,LIZA,Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
159491,L142240,u4593,m303,JONAS,"Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance."
159492,L142239,u4595,m303,LIZA,"If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here."
159493,L142238,u4593,m303,JONAS,As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
159494,L142237,u4595,m303,LIZA,Terminal?
159495,L142236,u4593,m303,JONAS,We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
159496,L142235,u4593,m303,JONAS,I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
159497,L142234,u4595,m303,LIZA,As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
159498,L142233,u4593,m303,JONAS,M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.

159500,L142231,u4593,m303,JONAS,"A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal."
159501,L142230,u4595,m303,LIZA,"It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?"

159515,L141937,u4595,m303,LIZA,Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
159516,L141934,u4595,m303,LIZA,A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
159517,L141933,u4593,m303,JONAS,Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?

159522,L141928,u4595,m303,LIZA,I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
159523,L141927,u4593,m303,JONAS,Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
159524,L141926,u4595,m303,LIZA,You've asked me that one three times.
159525,L141925,u4593,m303,JONAS,And you have no idea where he lives?
159526,L141924,u4595,m303,LIZA,You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
159527,L141923,u4593,m303,JONAS,So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
159528,L141905,u4593,m303,JONAS,It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
159529,L141904,u4595,m303,LIZA,And you feel bad for it?
159530,L141903,u4593,m303,JONAS,You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.

159547,L142389,u4597,m303,OPERATOR,Yes.
159548,L142388,u4595,m303,LIZA,Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
159549,L142387,u4597,m303,OPERATOR,The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
159550,L142386,u4595,m303,LIZA,I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
159551,L142385,u4597,m303,OPERATOR,Federal Bureau of Investigation.
159552,L142277,u4598,m303,WILSON,What the hell does that mean?
159553,L142276,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too."
159554,L142138,u4595,m303,LIZA,-- Understood.
159555,L142137,u4598,m303,WILSON,"I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?"
159556,L142136,u4595,m303,LIZA,We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
159557,L142135,u4598,m303,WILSON,Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
159558,L142134,u4595,m303,LIZA,I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
159559,L142133,u4598,m303,WILSON,It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
159560,L142132,u4595,m303,LIZA,This doesn't make sense.
159561,L142131,u4598,m303,WILSON,"I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you."
159562,L141760,u4598,m303,WILSON,I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
159563,L141759,u4595,m303,LIZA,Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
159564,L141758,u4595,m303,LIZA,Not today...
159565,L141757,u4598,m303,WILSON,"Ah, your psychotic is here."
159566,L142430,u4595,m303,LIZA,I don't think so.
159567,L142429,u4596,m303,LOWRY,That you come with me.
159568,L142428,u4595,m303,LIZA,What do you suggest?
159569,L142427,u4596,m303,LOWRY,Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
159570,L142426,u4595,m303,LIZA,I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
159571,L142425,u4596,m303,LOWRY,No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
159572,L142424,u4595,m303,LIZA,Where do you think Jerry is?
159573,L142423,u4596,m303,LOWRY,Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
159574,L142422,u4595,m303,LIZA,He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
159575,L142421,u4596,m303,LOWRY,He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
159576,L142420,u4595,m303,LIZA,And Jonas?
159577,L142419,u4596,m303,LOWRY,"I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile."
159578,L142417,u4595,m303,LIZA,"Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?"
159579,L142416,u4596,m303,LOWRY,What gave me away?
159580,L142414,u4596,m303,LOWRY,You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
159581,L142413,u4595,m303,LIZA,Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
159582,L142412,u4596,m303,LOWRY,What do you mean?
159583,L142411,u4595,m303,LIZA,"I want to believe you, too."
159584,L142410,u4596,m303,LOWRY,"Yeah, I do."
159585,L142409,u4595,m303,LIZA,Do you believe me?
159586,L142408,u4596,m303,LOWRY,Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
159587,L142407,u4595,m303,LIZA,Can I talk to you a second?
159588,L141986,u4596,m303,LOWRY,Your call.  Have a good night.
159589,L141985,u4595,m303,LIZA,"When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know."
159590,L141984,u4596,m303,LOWRY,"It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?"
159591,L141983,u4595,m303,LIZA,Jonas?
159592,L141982,u4596,m303,LOWRY,Wasn't my idea.
159593,L141981,u4595,m303,LIZA,Agent Lowry.
159594,L141953,u4595,m303,LIZA,No.  Not yet.
159595,L141952,u4596,m303,LOWRY,"You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy."
159596,L141947,u4595,m303,LIZA,I was just thinking that.
159597,L141946,u4596,m303,LOWRY,That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
159598,L141915,u4595,m303,LIZA,I don't know.  Didn't see him.
159599,L141914,u4596,m303,LOWRY,Which way did he go?
159600,L141892,u4595,m303,LIZA,You don't understand --
159601,L141891,u4596,m303,LOWRY,Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
159602,L141890,u4595,m303,LIZA,Wait --
159603,L141889,u4596,m303,LOWRY,While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
159604,L141888,u4595,m303,LIZA,Tell me about it.
159605,L141887,u4596,m303,LOWRY,We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
159606,L143230,u4599,m304,A.T.L.,"There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off."
159607,L143229,u4609,m304,PETER,What?
159608,L143228,u4599,m304,A.T.L.,There's no plug to pull.
159609,L143227,u4609,m304,PETER,Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
159610,L143226,u4599,m304,A.T.L.,We've lost contact.
159611,L143224,u4609,m304,PETER,Ellie?
159612,L143223,u4599,m304,A.T.L.,"We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back."
159613,L143218,u4609,m304,PETER,"Anything happening in there, El?"
159614,L143217,u4599,m304,A.T.L.,I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
159615,L143216,u4609,m304,PETER,What?
159616,L143386,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
159617,L143385,u4600,m304,CHAIRMAN,"You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?"
159618,L143380,u4600,m304,CHAIRMAN,"All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?"
159619,L143379,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Is it possible...?
159620,L143378,u4600,m304,CHAIRMAN,"Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode."
159621,L143377,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Yes, sir."
159622,L143376,u4600,m304,CHAIRMAN,He died...  ... in 1972.
159623,L143375,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Yes, sir."
159624,L143374,u4600,m304,CHAIRMAN,... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
159625,L142805,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
159626,L142804,u4607,m304,KITZ,-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
159627,L142797,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,It's a hoax.  I knew it!
159628,L142796,u4607,m304,KITZ,What in the hell...?
159629,L142788,u4607,m304,KITZ,How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
159630,L142787,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Hope there's a cartoon.
159631,L142768,u4607,m304,KITZ,"Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --"
159632,L142767,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements."
159633,L142760,u4607,m304,KITZ,"Dr. Arroway, let me first say --"
159634,L142759,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor."
159635,L142758,u4607,m304,KITZ,Dr. Arroway --
159636,L142677,u4606,m304,KENT,So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
159637,L142676,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,So?
159638,L142675,u4606,m304,KENT,"Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry."
159639,L142674,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Tell me.
159640,L142673,u4606,m304,KENT,"Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but..."
159641,L142670,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?"
159642,L142669,u4606,m304,KENT,"Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?"
159643,L142668,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
159644,L143136,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you."
159645,L143135,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Thank you?
159646,L143134,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
159647,L143133,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"What would you have me say, David?"
159648,L143132,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair..."
159649,L143131,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Good luck, David."
159650,L143130,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Right.  Well.
159651,L143129,u4602,m304,ELLIE,This... seemed best.
159652,L143128,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,You aren't staying?
159653,L143018,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan."
159654,L143017,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications."
159655,L143014,u4602,m304,ELLIE,... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
159656,L143013,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air..."
159657,L142991,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting."
159658,L142990,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You...
159659,L142989,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
159660,L142988,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What?
159661,L142987,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
159662,L142986,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy."
159663,L142985,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,I don't understand.
159664,L142984,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request..."
159665,L142983,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It'll just take a moment.
159666,L142982,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Actually I'm running late --
159667,L142981,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Do you have a minute -- ?
159668,L142980,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Ellie.
159669,L142979,u4602,m304,ELLIE,David --
159670,L142972,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along."
159671,L142971,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You mean --
159672,L142970,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
159673,L142969,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What is it?  What's happened?
159674,L142900,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
159675,L142899,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa."
159676,L142852,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice."
159677,L142851,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Are you threatening me?
159678,L142850,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point."
159679,L142849,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Ellie --
159680,L142848,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad."
159681,L142847,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
159682,L142846,u4602,m304,ELLIE,With me.
159683,L142845,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
159684,L142844,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What?  Why?
159685,L142843,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders..."
159686,L142793,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
159687,L142792,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
159688,L142780,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
159689,L142779,u4602,m304,ELLIE,... could it be a nested code of some sort?
159690,L142757,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
159691,L142756,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?"
159692,L142755,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention."
159693,L142704,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
159694,L142703,u4602,m304,ELLIE,David --
159695,L142702,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then."
159696,L142701,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Goddamnit, they are out there, David --"
159697,L142700,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
159698,L142699,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not."
159699,L142698,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession."
159700,L142697,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --"
159701,L142696,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
159702,L142695,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Meaning...
159703,L142694,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,It's not like you've given me much choice.
159704,L142693,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"You can't just pull the plug, David."
159705,L142692,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --"
159706,L142691,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
159707,L142690,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,You know why I'm here.
159708,L142689,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi..."
159709,L142688,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Ellie...
159710,L142687,u4602,m304,ELLIE,No doubt.
159711,L142686,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
159712,L142685,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?"
159713,L142684,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
159714,L142683,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Really?  Congratulations, by the way."
159715,L142682,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
159716,L142681,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Oh?  How's he doing?
159717,L142680,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Peter sends his regards.
159718,L142679,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"No, thanks."
159719,L142678,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Pepsi?  Tequila?
159720,L142609,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
159721,L142608,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,I disagree.
159722,L142607,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
159723,L142606,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
159724,L142605,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You're --
159725,L142604,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
159726,L142603,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --"
159727,L142602,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
159728,L142601,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I'm willing to take that risk.
159729,L142600,u4601,m304,DRUMLIN,"I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide."
159730,L142914,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Well --
159731,L142913,u4610,m304,PRESIDENT LASKER,What's the status of the decryption effort?
159732,L142908,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky..."
159733,L142907,u4610,m304,PRESIDENT LASKER,"Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today."
159734,L142896,u4610,m304,PRESIDENT LASKER,A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
159735,L142895,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind."
159736,L142831,u4610,m304,PRESIDENT LASKER,How soon will you be able to decode it?
159737,L142830,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
159738,L142820,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
159739,L142819,u4610,m304,PRESIDENT LASKER,What does it say?
159740,L142859,u4608,m304,LUNACHARSKY,"I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it."
159741,L142858,u4602,m304,ELLIE,How can that be?
159742,L142857,u4608,m304,LUNACHARSKY,No primer.
159743,L142856,u4602,m304,ELLIE,And?
159744,L142855,u4608,m304,LUNACHARSKY,We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
159745,L142854,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What?
159746,L142833,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
159747,L142832,u4608,m304,LUNACHARSKY,"There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never."
159748,L142814,u4602,m304,ELLIE,A third layer.
159749,L142813,u4608,m304,LUNACHARSKY,In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
159750,L142812,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What...
159751,L142782,u4608,m304,LUNACHARSKY,Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
159752,L142781,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Dr. Lunacharsky...?
159753,L142728,u4613,m304,WILLIE,NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
159754,L142727,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"How's the spying tonight, guys?"
159755,L142723,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always."
159756,L142722,u4613,m304,WILLIE,That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
159757,L142718,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Put it on speakers.
159758,L142717,u4613,m304,WILLIE,Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
159759,L142713,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?"
159760,L142712,u4613,m304,WILLIE,"Got a bogey, boss?"
159761,L142665,u4602,m304,ELLIE,VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
159762,L142664,u4613,m304,WILLIE,"Been there, done that, got the T-shirt."
159763,L142663,u4602,m304,ELLIE,J39 Z186...?
159764,L142818,u4606,m304,KENT,"It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413."
159765,L142817,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
159766,L142774,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It's a civilian facility.
159767,L142773,u4606,m304,KENT,Can't we get rid of them?
159768,L142736,u4606,m304,KENT,"It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young."
159769,L142735,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin."
159770,L142667,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something..."
159771,L142666,u4606,m304,KENT,"You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally."
159772,L142655,u4606,m304,KENT,"Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too."
159773,L142654,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It's beautiful.
159774,L142653,u4606,m304,KENT,It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
159775,L142652,u4602,m304,ELLIE,This is how you see the sky?
159776,L142651,u4606,m304,KENT,"Here, right around Centaurus A."
159777,L142650,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Nice.  Where?
159778,L142649,u4606,m304,KENT,1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
159779,L142648,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Ellie.  Pulsar?
159780,L142647,u4606,m304,KENT,"Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor."
159781,L142646,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Dr. Cullers?
159782,L143391,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Because I can't.
159783,L143390,u4607,m304,KITZ,So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
159784,L143384,u4602,m304,ELLIE,-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
159785,L143383,u4607,m304,KITZ,"Thank you, Doctor.  Now --"
159786,L143382,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
159787,L143381,u4607,m304,KITZ,"Please answer the question, Doctor."
159788,L143373,u4602,m304,ELLIE,By our standards... yes.
159789,L143372,u4607,m304,KITZ,"In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible."
159790,L143371,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right."
159791,L143370,u4607,m304,KITZ,"And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?"
159792,L143369,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"There is no direct evidence, no."
159793,L143334,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have."
159794,L143333,u4607,m304,KITZ,Is that your official response?
159795,L143332,u4602,m304,ELLIE,... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
159796,L142826,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own."
159797,L142825,u4607,m304,KITZ,"If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --"
159798,L142824,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Pardon me, but you can't do -- !"
159799,L142777,u4607,m304,KITZ,And a hundred mile airspace.
159800,L142776,u4602,m304,ELLIE,And a hundred mile airspace.
159801,L142775,u4607,m304,KITZ,"Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately."
159802,L142770,u4607,m304,KITZ,You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
159803,L142769,u4602,m304,ELLIE,-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
159804,L142766,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You want to classify prime numbers?
159805,L142765,u4607,m304,KITZ,I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
159806,L142764,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans."
159807,L142763,u4607,m304,KITZ,"I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security."
159808,L143310,u4612,m304,TED,"Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up."
159809,L143309,u4602,m304,ELLIE,No.  Please.
159810,L143308,u4612,m304,TED,It's time to go home now.
159811,L143306,u4612,m304,TED,Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
159812,L143305,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --"
159813,L143304,u4612,m304,TED,"No more stalling, Captain."
159814,L143303,u4602,m304,ELLIE,But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
159815,L143302,u4612,m304,TED,That isn't the way it works.
159816,L143301,u4602,m304,ELLIE,But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
159817,L143300,u4612,m304,TED,Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
159818,L143299,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean."
159819,L143298,u4612,m304,TED,"If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense."
159820,L143297,u4602,m304,ELLIE,No!  I mean... why so soon?
159821,L143296,u4612,m304,TED,Now... you go home.
159822,L143295,u4602,m304,ELLIE,So.  What happens now?
159823,L143294,u4612,m304,TED,"You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms."
159824,L143293,u4602,m304,ELLIE,... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
159825,L143292,u4602,m304,ELLIE,The librarian... or the library...?
159826,L143291,u4612,m304,TED,Am I one... or many?
159827,L143282,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Can you help us?
159828,L143281,u4612,m304,TED,"... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to."
159829,L143279,u4612,m304,TED,"You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation..."
159830,L143278,u4602,m304,ELLIE,So we passed some kind of test?
159831,L143277,u4612,m304,TED,Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
159832,L143276,u4602,m304,ELLIE,The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
159833,L143275,u4612,m304,TED,"We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here."
159834,L143274,u4602,m304,ELLIE,So who...?
159835,L143273,u4612,m304,TED,"Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers."
159836,L143272,u4602,m304,ELLIE,And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
159837,L143271,u4612,m304,TED,Many others.
159838,L143270,u4602,m304,ELLIE,And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
159839,L143269,u4612,m304,TED,You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
159840,L143268,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Why did you contact us?
159841,L143267,u4612,m304,TED,"Small moves, Captain, small moves."
159842,L143266,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Can you show me?

159844,L143264,u4602,m304,ELLIE,So who -- what -- are you?
159845,L143262,u4612,m304,TED,We thought this might make things a little easier.
159846,L143261,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola."
159847,L143260,u4612,m304,TED,Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
159848,L143259,u4602,m304,ELLIE,So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
159849,L143258,u4612,m304,TED,That's my scientist.
159850,L143257,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You're not real.  None of this is.
159851,L143256,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?"
159852,L143255,u4612,m304,TED,"I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart."
159853,L143254,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
159854,L142562,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Okay.
159855,L142561,u4612,m304,TED,"Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?"
159856,L142558,u4612,m304,TED,"That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep."
159857,L142557,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Pensacola.
159858,L142556,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Okay, okay... there."
159859,L142555,u4612,m304,TED,"Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling."
159860,L142554,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Could we hear God?

159864,L142550,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Could we hear to China?

159866,L142544,u4602,m304,ELLIE,But what do I say?
159867,L142543,u4612,m304,TED,Talk to him.
159868,L142540,u4612,m304,TED,Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
159869,L142539,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I can't move any smaller.

159871,L143162,u4603,m304,HADDEN,Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
159872,L143161,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Why don't you come back with me?
159873,L143159,u4602,m304,ELLIE,-- of Hadden Industries.
159874,L143158,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --"
159875,L143157,u4603,m304,HADDEN,Mmm.  Look closer.
159876,L143156,u4602,m304,ELLIE,The systems integration site.
159877,L143155,u4603,m304,HADDEN,Hokkaido Island.
159878,L143154,u4603,m304,HADDEN,Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
159879,L143153,u4602,m304,ELLIE,The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
159880,L143152,u4603,m304,HADDEN,I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
159881,L143151,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
159882,L143150,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time."
159883,L143149,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What are you talking about?  It's over.
159884,L143148,u4603,m304,HADDEN,Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
159885,L143147,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too."
159886,L143146,u4603,m304,HADDEN,Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
159887,L143145,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What's that?
159888,L143144,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed."
159889,L143143,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It's so... small.
159890,L143142,u4603,m304,HADDEN,A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
159891,L142894,u4603,m304,HADDEN,That's my girl.  Done.
159892,L142893,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment."
159893,L142892,u4603,m304,HADDEN,In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
159894,L142891,u4602,m304,ELLIE,And in return?
159895,L142890,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside."
159896,L142889,u4602,m304,ELLIE,A machine.  But a machine that does what?
159897,L142888,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something."
159898,L142887,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Some kind of circuitry...?
159899,L142884,u4603,m304,HADDEN,-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
159900,L142883,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
159901,L142882,u4603,m304,HADDEN,Not if you think like a Vegan.
159902,L142881,u4602,m304,ELLIE,A page-break signal.  A period.
159903,L142880,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each..."
159904,L142878,u4603,m304,HADDEN,That's my girl...  Lights.
159905,L142877,u4602,m304,ELLIE,If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
159906,L142876,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much."
159907,L142875,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?"
159908,L142874,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it."
159909,L142873,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I didn't realize I was out.
159910,L142872,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in."
159911,L142871,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What kind of deal?
159912,L142870,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal."
159913,L142869,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?"
159914,L142868,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth."
159915,L142867,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You live here.
159916,L142866,u4603,m304,HADDEN,"Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said..."
159917,L142865,u4602,m304,ELLIE,S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
159918,L143122,u4604,m304,JEAN-CLAUDE,"I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way."
159919,L143121,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
159920,L143120,u4604,m304,JEAN-CLAUDE,"I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home."
159921,L143119,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I thought you were here because you want to go.
159922,L143118,u4604,m304,JEAN-CLAUDE,"Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated."
159923,L143117,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I'd say this is slightly different.
159924,L143020,u4602,m304,ELLIE,We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
159925,L143019,u4604,m304,JEAN-CLAUDE,Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
159926,L143331,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape..."
159927,L143330,u4609,m304,PETER,"That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --"
159928,L143329,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
159929,L143321,u4602,m304,ELLIE,How long was I gone?
159930,L143320,u4609,m304,PETER,What day?
159931,L143319,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?"
159932,L143318,u4609,m304,PETER,"It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --"
159933,L143317,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Wait -- hold on a minute --
159934,L143316,u4609,m304,PETER,"Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --"
159935,L143315,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I'm -- I'm fine.
159936,L143314,u4609,m304,PETER,Ellie -- are you okay?
159937,L143211,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Like it.  Almost there.
159938,L143210,u4609,m304,PETER,Like it or not.
159939,L143209,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"That you, Valerian?"
159940,L143208,u4609,m304,PETER,It's really happening.
159941,L143207,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Someone tell me this is really happening.
159942,L142929,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You too.
159943,L142928,u4609,m304,PETER,"It's good to see you, Ellie."
159944,L142921,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Peter.
159945,L142920,u4609,m304,PETER,Ellie.
159946,L142644,u4609,m304,PETER,"That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry."
159947,L142643,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You sonofabitch.
159948,L142642,u4609,m304,PETER,Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
159949,L142641,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I'm serious about this, Peter --"
159950,L142640,u4609,m304,PETER,Ellie --
159951,L142639,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
159952,L142638,u4609,m304,PETER,Jesus --
159953,L142637,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married."
159954,L142636,u4609,m304,PETER,"Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want."
159955,L142635,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --"
159956,L142634,u4609,m304,PETER,"'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --"
159957,L142633,u4602,m304,ELLIE,But the work --
159958,L142632,u4609,m304,PETER,This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
159959,L142631,u4602,m304,ELLIE,But what about your research -- ?
159960,L142630,u4609,m304,PETER,I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
159961,L142629,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Greenbank?
159962,L142628,u4609,m304,PETER,-- I'm moving to Washington.
159963,L142627,u4602,m304,ELLIE,We could be together again --
159964,L142626,u4609,m304,PETER,Actually --
159965,L142625,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
159966,L142624,u4609,m304,PETER,Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
159967,L142623,u4602,m304,ELLIE,The V.L.A.?
159968,L142622,u4609,m304,PETER,What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
159969,L142621,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
159970,L142620,u4609,m304,PETER,How close are you to getting this funding put together?
159971,L142619,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now."
159972,L142618,u4609,m304,PETER,"Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all."
159973,L142617,u4602,m304,ELLIE,... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
159974,L142616,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started..."
159975,L142615,u4609,m304,PETER,And?
159976,L142614,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
159977,L142613,u4609,m304,PETER,Any luck on the grant money?
159978,L142612,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you."
159979,L142596,u4602,m304,ELLIE,'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
159980,L142595,u4609,m304,PETER,'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
159981,L142594,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist..."
159982,L142593,u4609,m304,PETER,They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
159983,L142592,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts..."
159984,L142590,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
159985,L142589,u4609,m304,PETER,"Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence."
159986,L142588,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
159987,L142586,u4609,m304,PETER,Yavol.
159988,L142585,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Sounds like a Russian general.
159989,L142584,u4609,m304,PETER,Peter Valerian.
159990,L142583,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Ellie.  Arroway.
159991,L142582,u4609,m304,PETER,That's what they all say.
159992,L142581,u4602,m304,ELLIE,He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
159993,L142580,u4609,m304,PETER,It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
159994,L142579,u4602,m304,ELLIE,... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
159995,L143408,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love."
159996,L143407,u4605,m304,JOSS,Meaning...
159997,L143406,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
159998,L143405,u4605,m304,JOSS,Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
159999,L143404,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning..."
160000,L143403,u4605,m304,JOSS,In other words.
160001,L143402,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"In other words, God works in mysterious ways..."
160002,L143401,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology."
160003,L143400,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?"
160004,L143362,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened."
160005,L143361,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true."
160006,L143360,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!"
160007,L143359,u4602,m304,ELLIE,But --
160008,L143358,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!"
160009,L143357,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real."
160010,L143356,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you."
160011,L143355,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I don't have any proof, Palmer."
160012,L143354,u4605,m304,JOSS,"It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's."
160013,L143353,u4602,m304,ELLIE,You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
160014,L143352,u4605,m304,JOSS,I do.
160015,L143351,u4602,m304,ELLIE,They don't believe me.
160016,L143350,u4605,m304,JOSS,I'm not sure it's come to that.
160017,L143349,u4602,m304,ELLIE,So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
160018,L143348,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you."
160019,L143347,u4605,m304,JOSS,It was quite a page turner.
160020,L143346,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I'm assuming you read my deposition.
160021,L143345,u4605,m304,JOSS,Hi.
160022,L143344,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Hi.
160023,L143196,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please."
160024,L143195,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone."
160025,L143194,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I can't hear this now --
160026,L143193,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?"
160027,L143192,u4602,m304,ELLIE,-- I don't know --
160028,L143191,u4605,m304,JOSS,And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
160029,L143190,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
160030,L143189,u4605,m304,JOSS,"I'm in love with you, Ellie."
160031,L143188,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Please --
160032,L143187,u4605,m304,JOSS,What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
160033,L143186,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --"
160034,L143185,u4605,m304,JOSS,What are you so afraid of?
160035,L143184,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I can't do this --
160036,L143183,u4605,m304,JOSS,What?
160037,L143182,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I'm sorry -- I can't --
160038,L143181,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Ellie, what is it?"
160039,L143180,u4605,m304,JOSS,What is it?
160040,L143179,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I'm sorry.
160041,L143178,u4605,m304,JOSS,What...?
160042,L143177,u4605,m304,JOSS,Maybe that's okay.
160043,L143176,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
160044,L143175,u4605,m304,JOSS,You're trembling.
160045,L143174,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Thank you.
160046,L143173,u4605,m304,JOSS,"During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so..."
160047,L143172,u4605,m304,JOSS,Oh.  I brought you something.
160048,L143171,u4602,m304,ELLIE,The final countdown.
160049,L143170,u4605,m304,JOSS,So.  The final countdown.
160050,L143169,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?"
160051,L143168,u4605,m304,JOSS,Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
160052,L143103,u4605,m304,JOSS,"What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'"
160053,L143102,u4602,m304,ELLIE,How do you mean?
160054,L143101,u4605,m304,JOSS,"An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?"
160055,L143100,u4602,m304,ELLIE,... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
160056,L143098,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It's late.  We should go back.
160057,L143097,u4605,m304,JOSS,Ellie --
160058,L143095,u4605,m304,JOSS,"What are you so afraid of, Ellie?"
160059,L143094,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It's getting late...
160060,L143093,u4605,m304,JOSS,"And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?"
160061,L143092,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
160062,L143091,u4605,m304,JOSS,Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
160063,L143090,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
160064,L143089,u4605,m304,JOSS,I don't follow.
160065,L143088,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?"
160066,L143087,u4605,m304,JOSS,"I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science."
160067,L143086,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
160068,L143085,u4605,m304,JOSS,I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
160069,L143084,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
160070,L143083,u4605,m304,JOSS,What'd you think?
160071,L143082,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
160072,L143081,u4605,m304,JOSS,Really.
160073,L143080,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I read your book.
160074,L143079,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
160075,L143078,u4605,m304,JOSS,You're willing to die for this.
160076,L143077,u4602,m304,ELLIE,If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
160077,L143076,u4605,m304,JOSS,And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
160078,L143075,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Something like that.
160079,L143074,u4605,m304,JOSS,If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
160080,L143073,u4602,m304,ELLIE,If you came back.
160081,L143072,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --"
160082,L143071,u4602,m304,ELLIE,In other words.
160083,L143070,u4605,m304,JOSS,"In other words, God is one hell of an engineer."
160084,L143069,u4602,m304,ELLIE,It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
160085,L143068,u4605,m304,JOSS,Why?
160086,L143067,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I don't think so.
160087,L143066,u4605,m304,JOSS,Maybe you're creating a monster.
160088,L143065,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems."
160089,L143064,u4605,m304,JOSS,Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
160090,L143063,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
160091,L143062,u4605,m304,JOSS,Some of my best friends are scientists.
160092,L143061,u4602,m304,ELLIE,So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
160093,L142968,u4605,m304,JOSS,Prove it.
160094,L142967,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Yes.  Very much.
160095,L142966,u4605,m304,JOSS,Did you love him?
160096,L142965,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
160097,L142964,u4605,m304,JOSS,Do you love your parents?
160098,L142963,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?"
160099,L142962,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with."
160100,L142961,u4602,m304,ELLIE,And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
160101,L142960,u4605,m304,JOSS,"I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone."
160102,L142959,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Can you try?
160103,L142958,u4605,m304,JOSS,"... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go."
160104,L142957,u4605,m304,JOSS,Now you know.
160105,L142956,u4602,m304,ELLIE,That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
160106,L142955,u4605,m304,JOSS,Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
160107,L142954,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I flinched.
160108,L142951,u4605,m304,JOSS,"So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch."
160109,L142950,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"And mind, yes.  What are you --"
160110,L142949,u4605,m304,JOSS,And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
160111,L142948,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics."
160112,L142947,u4605,m304,JOSS,"Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller."
160113,L142943,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small."
160114,L142942,u4605,m304,JOSS,'My father's house has many mansions.'
160115,L142941,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations."
160116,L142940,u4605,m304,JOSS,How do you mean?
160117,L142939,u4602,m304,ELLIE,What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
160118,L142938,u4605,m304,JOSS,Spoken like a true believer.
160119,L142937,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
160120,L142936,u4605,m304,JOSS,And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
160121,L142935,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
160122,L142934,u4605,m304,JOSS,"... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith."
160123,L142931,u4605,m304,JOSS,Make that two.
160124,L142930,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Champagne please.
160125,L142912,u4605,m304,JOSS,I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
160126,L142911,u4602,m304,ELLIE,And where exactly does that put your position...?
160127,L142910,u4605,m304,JOSS,"I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent."
160128,L143109,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try."
160129,L143108,u4611,m304,PROJECT OFFICIAL,"Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --"
160130,L143107,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --"
160131,L143106,u4611,m304,PROJECT OFFICIAL,"How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?"
160132,L143105,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it."
160133,L143050,u4602,m304,ELLIE,Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
160134,L143049,u4611,m304,PROJECT OFFICIAL,"Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless."
160135,L143048,u4602,m304,ELLIE,"Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --"
160136,L143047,u4611,m304,PROJECT OFFICIAL,It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
160137,L143046,u4602,m304,ELLIE,I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
160138,L143045,u4611,m304,PROJECT OFFICIAL,"You have a question, Dr. Arroway?"
160139,L143342,u4610,m304,PRESIDENT LASKER,Have your department make a full report.
160140,L143341,u4607,m304,KITZ,I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
160141,L143340,u4610,m304,PRESIDENT LASKER,Recommendations?
160142,L143339,u4607,m304,KITZ,"... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable."
160143,L142836,u4610,m304,PRESIDENT LASKER,"That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet."
160144,L142835,u4607,m304,KITZ,But --
160145,L142834,u4610,m304,PRESIDENT LASKER,"Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together."
160146,L142816,u4607,m304,KITZ,What is it?
160147,L142815,u4610,m304,PRESIDENT LASKER,Oh my God...
160148,L143543,u4617,m305,BOSS PAUL,Cut that backsass!
160149,L143542,u4614,m305,ALIBI,But I made this arrangement --
160150,L143541,u4617,m305,BOSS PAUL,"Git movin', I said."
160151,L143540,u4614,m305,ALIBI,I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
160152,L143539,u4617,m305,BOSS PAUL,Git your shovel and git to work.
160153,L143538,u4614,m305,ALIBI,"Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom."
160154,L143572,u4614,m305,ALIBI,I got two years.
160155,L143571,u4622,m305,KOKO,"Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made."
160156,L143526,u4614,m305,ALIBI,"I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else."
160157,L143525,u4622,m305,KOKO,Buck is a deal.
160158,L143524,u4614,m305,ALIBI,I'll make it a dollar.
160159,L143523,u4622,m305,KOKO,Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
160160,L143510,u4614,m305,ALIBI,We work down in the ditch?
160161,L143509,u4622,m305,KOKO,"I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch."
160162,L143473,u4614,m305,ALIBI,It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --

160497,L144461,u4626,m306,ANDY,"No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face."
160498,L144460,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible."
160499,L144368,u4626,m306,ANDY,Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
160500,L144367,u4630,m306,HELEN,"But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy."
160501,L144366,u4626,m306,ANDY,Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
160502,L144365,u4630,m306,HELEN,"You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look."
160503,L144363,u4630,m306,HELEN,Andy?
160504,L144362,u4626,m306,ANDY,Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
160505,L144361,u4626,m306,ANDY,Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
160506,L144360,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?"
160507,L144359,u4626,m306,ANDY,When was the last time you washed your hair?
160508,L144358,u4630,m306,HELEN,Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
160509,L144357,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison."
160510,L144356,u4626,m306,ANDY,He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
160511,L144355,u4630,m306,HELEN,"He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!"
160512,L144354,u4626,m306,ANDY,A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
160513,L144353,u4630,m306,HELEN,"I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said ""You and me, you and me."""
160514,L144352,u4626,m306,ANDY,Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
160515,L144351,u4630,m306,HELEN,I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
160516,L144350,u4626,m306,ANDY,"Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?"
160517,L144349,u4630,m306,HELEN,I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
160518,L144348,u4626,m306,ANDY,"Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?"
160519,L144347,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh..."
160520,L144572,u4626,m306,ANDY,"Gaahhd!  What a <u>cop</u>!  You busted me!  The new one, in the Marina.  She has a police radio scanner. It's always on.  She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again.  She's obsessed.  She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it."
160521,L144571,u4631,m306,M.J.,Tell her about <u>what</u>?
160522,L144570,u4626,m306,ANDY,She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
160523,L144411,u4626,m306,ANDY,"Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe..."
160524,L144410,u4631,m306,M.J.,Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
160525,L144409,u4626,m306,ANDY,"Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this."
160526,L144408,u4631,m306,M.J.,We'll get the paramedics...
160527,L144385,u4631,m306,M.J.,You talked to me.  Do you remember?
160528,L144384,u4626,m306,ANDY,Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
160529,L144377,u4626,m306,ANDY,I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
160530,L144376,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog."
160531,L144444,u4630,m306,HELEN,Yes.  I believed him.
160532,L144443,u4627,m306,ATTORNEY,And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
160533,L144442,u4630,m306,HELEN,When he was seventeen.
160534,L144441,u4627,m306,ATTORNEY,When was that?
160535,L144440,u4630,m306,HELEN,He told me he had done two others just like it.
160536,L144439,u4627,m306,ATTORNEY,"What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?"
160537,L144438,u4630,m306,HELEN,The first two murders.
160538,L144435,u4630,m306,HELEN,The same as the first time...
160539,L144434,u4627,m306,ATTORNEY,What pattern was that?
160540,L144433,u4630,m306,HELEN,He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
160541,L144432,u4630,m306,HELEN,Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
160542,L144431,u4627,m306,ATTORNEY,"You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?"
160543,L144430,u4630,m306,HELEN,I thought he was lying.
160544,L144429,u4627,m306,ATTORNEY,"'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did."
160545,L144428,u4630,m306,HELEN,He was lying.
160546,L144427,u4627,m306,ATTORNEY,Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
160547,L144426,u4630,m306,HELEN,The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
160548,L144425,u4627,m306,ATTORNEY,"Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?"
160549,L144424,u4630,m306,HELEN,Yes.  Without question.
160550,L144976,u4628,m306,CONRAD,What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
160551,L144975,u4631,m306,M.J.,What Friday?
160552,L144974,u4628,m306,CONRAD,"No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks."
160553,L144973,u4631,m306,M.J.,You already made the delivery?
160554,L144972,u4628,m306,CONRAD,"Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away."
160555,L144971,u4628,m306,CONRAD,I don't have it...
160556,L144970,u4631,m306,M.J.,You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
160557,L144969,u4628,m306,CONRAD,Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
160558,L144968,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself..."
160559,L144967,u4628,m306,CONRAD,You get me out first.
160560,L144966,u4631,m306,M.J.,"You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten."
160561,L144965,u4628,m306,CONRAD,I never carried a gun!
160562,L144964,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious..."
160563,L144963,u4628,m306,CONRAD,I never hurt nobody...
160564,L144962,u4631,m306,M.J.,Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
160565,L144961,u4628,m306,CONRAD,I was?  How you spell that?
160566,L144960,u4631,m306,M.J.,Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
160567,L144959,u4628,m306,CONRAD,Who are you?
160568,L144822,u4636,m306,RUBEN,She don't want it.
160569,L144821,u4628,m306,CONRAD,She's supposed to have it.
160570,L144820,u4636,m306,RUBEN,We know...  Send the book to evidence...
160571,L144819,u4628,m306,CONRAD,The door was already open...
160572,L144818,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering."
160573,L144817,u4628,m306,CONRAD,"Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her."
160574,L144816,u4628,m306,CONRAD,I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
160575,L144815,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Where is it?
160576,L144814,u4628,m306,CONRAD,"The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs..."
160577,L144813,u4636,m306,RUBEN,You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
160578,L144812,u4628,m306,CONRAD,"I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present..."
160579,L144811,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again..."
160580,L144930,u4629,m306,DARYLL,"That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good."
160581,L144929,u4630,m306,HELEN,In jail.
160582,L144928,u4629,m306,DARYLL,"Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?"
160583,L144927,u4630,m306,HELEN,How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
160584,L144926,u4629,m306,DARYLL,"Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you."
160585,L144925,u4630,m306,HELEN,Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
160586,L144924,u4629,m306,DARYLL,You come and visit.
160587,L144923,u4630,m306,HELEN,"I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place."
160588,L144922,u4629,m306,DARYLL,"Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?"
160589,L144921,u4630,m306,HELEN,I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
160590,L144920,u4629,m306,DARYLL,Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
160591,L144919,u4630,m306,HELEN,Ah ha.  What did he want?
160592,L144918,u4629,m306,DARYLL,Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
160593,L144917,u4630,m306,HELEN,"I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten."
160594,L144916,u4629,m306,DARYLL,Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
160595,L144915,u4630,m306,HELEN,"I'll look for it, Daryll Lee."
160596,L144914,u4629,m306,DARYLL,"I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!"
160597,L144913,u4630,m306,HELEN,What book?
160598,L144912,u4629,m306,DARYLL,"You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet."
160599,L144911,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Hello, Daryll Lee."
160600,L145195,u4634,m306,PETER,"Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor?  That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick.  So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you?  Death is the only cure for people like me."
160601,L145194,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness..."
160602,L145193,u4634,m306,PETER,"Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  ""Let me help you..."""
160603,L145190,u4634,m306,PETER,"I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument."
160604,L145189,u4630,m306,HELEN,"That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers..."
160605,L145188,u4634,m306,PETER,"Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you."
160606,L145187,u4630,m306,HELEN,"I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it."
160607,L145186,u4634,m306,PETER,We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then...
160608,L145181,u4634,m306,PETER,"Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you."
160609,L145180,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it."
160610,L145179,u4634,m306,PETER,No.  Not yet.
160611,L145178,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Kill me, Peter, do it, now."
160612,L145141,u4630,m306,HELEN,Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
160613,L145140,u4634,m306,PETER,You know where.
160614,L145139,u4630,m306,HELEN,Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
160615,L145136,u4634,m306,PETER,"I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good."
160616,L145135,u4630,m306,HELEN,You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
160617,L145134,u4634,m306,PETER,"I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then..."
160618,L145133,u4630,m306,HELEN,"For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me."
160619,L145131,u4634,m306,PETER,"Oh, I think you will."
160620,L145130,u4630,m306,HELEN,You know I can't do that.
160621,L145129,u4634,m306,PETER,Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
160622,L145128,u4630,m306,HELEN,"It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?"
160623,L145127,u4634,m306,PETER,"What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?"
160624,L145126,u4634,m306,PETER,"<u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner..."
160625,L145125,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Where are you, Peter?"
160626,L145124,u4634,m306,PETER,"You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart."
160627,L145123,u4630,m306,HELEN,Who was the man in the basement?
160628,L145122,u4634,m306,PETER,"Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?"
160629,L145224,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Well, thanks."
160630,L145223,u4630,m306,HELEN,Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
160631,L145100,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous."
160632,L145099,u4630,m306,HELEN,"If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?"
160633,L145098,u4631,m306,M.J.,This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
160634,L145097,u4630,m306,HELEN,"He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape."
160635,L145096,u4631,m306,M.J.,Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
160636,L145095,u4630,m306,HELEN,They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
160637,L145094,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top."
160638,L145036,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out."
160639,L145035,u4630,m306,HELEN,W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
160640,L145034,u4631,m306,M.J.,How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
160641,L145033,u4631,m306,M.J.,I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.

Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him."
160643,L145026,u4630,m306,HELEN,Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere. What does he do?  Nothing.

It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!"
160655,L145014,u4630,m306,HELEN,He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
160656,L145013,u4631,m306,M.J.,I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!

He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba."
160666,L144867,u4630,m306,HELEN,They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!

160669,L144864,u4631,m306,M.J.,He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
160670,L144863,u4630,m306,HELEN,They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
160671,L144774,u4630,m306,HELEN,Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
160672,L144773,u4631,m306,M.J.,Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
160673,L144772,u4630,m306,HELEN,One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...

160677,L144741,u4631,m306,M.J.,Because I'm all you've got.

160679,L144739,u4631,m306,M.J.,I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
160680,L144738,u4630,m306,HELEN,You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!

160687,L144727,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't."
160688,L144726,u4631,m306,M.J.,Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
160689,L144725,u4630,m306,HELEN,It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
160690,L144724,u4631,m306,M.J.,"I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows..."

160694,L144718,u4630,m306,HELEN,Is that it?
160695,L144717,u4631,m306,M.J.,So far nothing they test for comes up positive.

160702,L144706,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate."
160703,L144705,u4630,m306,HELEN,Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
160704,L144704,u4631,m306,M.J.,"He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?"
160705,L144703,u4630,m306,HELEN,I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
160706,L144702,u4631,m306,M.J.,Who turned off the Internet computer...
160707,L144701,u4630,m306,HELEN,"You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure..."
160708,L144700,u4631,m306,M.J.,"She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says ""no dumping.""  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it."
160709,L144699,u4630,m306,HELEN,Then what do you need me for?
160710,L144698,u4631,m306,M.J.,But it's a different m.o.
160711,L144697,u4630,m306,HELEN,That's no surprise.
160712,L144696,u4631,m306,M.J.,We've got another one.
160713,L144592,u4631,m306,M.J.,I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
160714,L144591,u4630,m306,HELEN,He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
160715,L144590,u4631,m306,M.J.,"That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?"
160716,L144581,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this."
160717,L144580,u4631,m306,M.J.,Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
160718,L144579,u4630,m306,HELEN,"It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught."
160719,L144578,u4631,m306,M.J.,Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
160720,L144577,u4630,m306,HELEN,She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
160721,L144576,u4631,m306,M.J.,I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
160722,L144575,u4630,m306,HELEN,Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
160723,L144574,u4631,m306,M.J.,I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
160724,L144573,u4630,m306,HELEN,I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
160725,L144560,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?"
160726,L144559,u4631,m306,M.J.,We'll show that to...
160727,L144553,u4631,m306,M.J.,<u>He</u> won't.
160728,L144552,u4630,m306,HELEN,"One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone."
160729,L144551,u4631,m306,M.J.,I'm going to put a guard on your door.
160730,L144546,u4630,m306,HELEN,It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
160731,L144545,u4631,m306,M.J.,Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
160732,L144539,u4630,m306,HELEN,Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
160733,L144538,u4631,m306,M.J.,How do you know that?
160734,L144513,u4631,m306,M.J.,Work with me.
160735,L144512,u4630,m306,HELEN,"If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me."
160736,L144511,u4631,m306,M.J.,Why imitate a dead serial killer?
160737,L144507,u4630,m306,HELEN,"I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot."
160738,L144506,u4631,m306,M.J.,How did you know they were stockings?
160739,L144505,u4630,m306,HELEN,Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
160740,L144504,u4631,m306,M.J.,Nothing.
160741,L144503,u4630,m306,HELEN,"The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?"
160742,L144502,u4630,m306,HELEN,He felt remorse.  He covered her.
160743,L144501,u4631,m306,M.J.,How do you know that?
160744,L144500,u4630,m306,HELEN,It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
160745,L144499,u4631,m306,M.J.,For months... last October.
160746,L144498,u4630,m306,HELEN,Is it an ongoing case?

160749,L144398,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good."
160750,L144397,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown."
160751,L144396,u4631,m306,M.J.,"I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours."

I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent."
160753,L144394,u4631,m306,M.J.,Would you want to work with us on this?
160754,L144393,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then."
160755,L144392,u4631,m306,M.J.,Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
160756,L144391,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way."
160757,L144390,u4631,m306,M.J.,"<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson."
160758,L144389,u4630,m306,HELEN,You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?

160761,L144382,u4631,m306,M.J.,Because of your phone calls.

160786,L144759,u4636,m306,RUBEN,<u>What</u>?...
160787,L144758,u4630,m306,HELEN,Don't hang up!
160788,L144753,u4630,m306,HELEN,She on the passenger side?
160789,L144752,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Yes.  I have to go...
160790,L144751,u4630,m306,HELEN,It's a woman shot in a car?
160791,L144617,u4630,m306,HELEN,Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
160792,L144616,u4636,m306,RUBEN,I'll get a locksmith.
160793,L144615,u4630,m306,HELEN,The lock...
160794,L144613,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
160795,L144612,u4630,m306,HELEN,Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
160796,L144609,u4630,m306,HELEN,I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
160797,L144608,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Tell me what to do!
160798,L144602,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben."
160799,L144601,u4636,m306,RUBEN,The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
160800,L144600,u4636,m306,RUBEN,No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
160801,L144599,u4630,m306,HELEN,Are you always so bold?
160802,L144598,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Not yet.
160803,L144597,u4630,m306,HELEN,You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
160804,L144594,u4630,m306,HELEN,That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
160805,L144593,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"We're through for the night, aren't we?  You go on.  Get some sleep. I'll stay until we can get a man out here and maybe catch a cab home."
160806,L144589,u4630,m306,HELEN,"MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?"
160807,L144588,u4636,m306,RUBEN,MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
160808,L144587,u4630,m306,HELEN,I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
160809,L144558,u4630,m306,HELEN,He's brilliant.  This one is brilliant.
160810,L144557,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that..."
160811,L144556,u4630,m306,HELEN,It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
160812,L144550,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Let me get a little action started here.
160813,L144549,u4630,m306,HELEN,"It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- ""Son of Sam"" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you."
160814,L144544,u4630,m306,HELEN,He can get into my computer any time he likes!  This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
160815,L144543,u4636,m306,RUBEN,He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
160816,L144542,u4630,m306,HELEN,That computer's wired into INTERNET.
160817,L144510,u4630,m306,HELEN,In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
160818,L144509,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"The Boston Strangler, when was that...?"
160819,L144508,u4630,m306,HELEN,Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
160820,L144402,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down..."
160821,L144401,u4630,m306,HELEN,I don't want this.  What are they?
160822,L144387,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door."
160823,L144386,u4630,m306,HELEN,"You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison."
160824,L145160,u4630,m306,HELEN,"He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me..."
160825,L145159,u4637,m306,SAKS,"You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over..."
160826,L145158,u4630,m306,HELEN,He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
160827,L145157,u4637,m306,SAKS,Just get out of your vehicle...
160828,L145156,u4630,m306,HELEN,"Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped."
160829,L145155,u4637,m306,SAKS,"Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle..."
160830,L144851,u4637,m306,SAKS,We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
160831,L144850,u4631,m306,M.J.,Okay.
160832,L144849,u4637,m306,SAKS,"She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement."
160833,L144848,u4631,m306,M.J.,How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
160834,L144847,u4637,m306,SAKS,Who prescribes the brandy?
160835,L144846,u4631,m306,M.J.,She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
160836,L144845,u4637,m306,SAKS,We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
160837,L144844,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop..."
160838,L144843,u4637,m306,SAKS,I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
160839,L144842,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't..."
160840,L144841,u4637,m306,SAKS,We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
160841,L144840,u4631,m306,M.J.,Over here.
160842,L144839,u4637,m306,SAKS,"Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called ""Murder By Numbers.""  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?"
160843,L144294,u4632,m306,MIKE,Lieutenant  Quinn.
160844,L144293,u4631,m306,M.J.,Who came in after you?
160845,L144292,u4632,m306,MIKE,"Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now."
160846,L144291,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later."
160847,L144277,u4632,m306,MIKE,No.  I didn't.
160848,L144276,u4631,m306,M.J.,"You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me."
160849,L144275,u4632,m306,MIKE,Michael Johnson.
160850,L144274,u4631,m306,M.J.,"I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?"
160851,L144273,u4632,m306,MIKE,I was.
160852,L145090,u4633,m306,NIKKO,Don't ever forget how good you are.
160853,L145089,u4631,m306,M.J.,Just horseshit luck.
160854,L145088,u4633,m306,NIKKO,I heard. Good police work.
160855,L144996,u4633,m306,NIKKO,Who gives a fuck?  In all the years I never seen you cry.  You loved him.
160856,L144995,u4631,m306,M.J.,"You're in terrible trouble, Nikko."
160857,L144994,u4633,m306,NIKKO,"Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back."
160858,L144993,u4631,m306,M.J.,Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
160859,L144645,u4633,m306,NIKKO,Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
160860,L144644,u4631,m306,M.J.,"If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?"
160861,L144485,u4631,m306,M.J.,"God, you're cute when you're mad."
160862,L144484,u4633,m306,NIKKO,"Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying."
160863,L144483,u4631,m306,M.J.,Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
160864,L144482,u4633,m306,NIKKO,Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
160865,L144481,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko."
160866,L144480,u4633,m306,NIKKO,You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
160867,L144479,u4631,m306,M.J.,"You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business."
160868,L144478,u4633,m306,NIKKO,It's none of my business anymore...
160869,L144475,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Oh, I know."
160870,L144474,u4633,m306,NIKKO,Working late.  You're a damn fool.
160871,L144328,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko..."
160872,L144327,u4633,m306,NIKKO,Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
160873,L144326,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Because it's your job, that's all."
160874,L144325,u4633,m306,NIKKO,What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
160875,L144956,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day."
160876,L144955,u4631,m306,M.J.,I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
160877,L144938,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Talk to Nikko...!
160878,L144937,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place..."
160879,L144936,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room."
160880,L144766,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Helen... excuse me, we..."
160881,L144765,u4636,m306,RUBEN,She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
160882,L144757,u4631,m306,M.J.,Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
160883,L144756,u4636,m306,RUBEN,What's Abba?
160884,L144664,u4631,m306,M.J.,The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
160885,L144663,u4636,m306,RUBEN,It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
160886,L144662,u4631,m306,M.J.,You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
160887,L144661,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
160888,L144660,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!"
160889,L144652,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"Look at him, grandstanding..."
160890,L144651,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Get the pictures, and casts of footprints."
160891,L144650,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Yeah, everything's different."
160892,L144649,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure."
160893,L144648,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report."
160894,L144641,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
160895,L144640,u4631,m306,M.J.,Look at her legs.
160896,L144639,u4636,m306,RUBEN,She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
160897,L144637,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this..."
160898,L144636,u4631,m306,M.J.,What about her arms?
160899,L144635,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions..."
160900,L144632,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here."
160901,L144631,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
160902,L144583,u4631,m306,M.J.,My promise.
160903,L144582,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Absolutely.
160904,L144548,u4631,m306,M.J.,Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
160905,L144547,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape..."
160906,L144521,u4631,m306,M.J.,Let's get out of here...
160907,L144520,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?"
160908,L144492,u4631,m306,M.J.,Tell it to your shrink.
160909,L144491,u4636,m306,RUBEN,I like women like that!
160910,L144490,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Honest to God, Ruben!"
160911,L144489,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Nada.  Lemme make the call.
160912,L144488,u4631,m306,M.J.,He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
160913,L144487,u4636,m306,RUBEN,What's wrong with him?
160914,L144417,u4631,m306,M.J.,Order Chinese for us and meet me the library?  Anything but beef.
160915,L144416,u4636,m306,RUBEN,You came in there with this attitude...
160916,L144415,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me."
160917,L144414,u4636,m306,RUBEN,Classy madonna.
160918,L144413,u4631,m306,M.J.,Snotty neurotic bitch...
160919,L144331,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody."
160920,L144330,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers..."
160921,L144258,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?"
160922,L144257,u4631,m306,M.J.,"You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them."
160923,L144254,u4636,m306,RUBEN,I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
160924,L144253,u4631,m306,M.J.,Answer it.
160925,L144246,u4636,m306,RUBEN,"Yeah, but she had divine guidance."
160926,L144245,u4631,m306,M.J.,My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
160927,L145218,u4635,m306,QUINN,"No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things..."
160928,L145217,u4631,m306,M.J.,She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
160929,L145047,u4635,m306,QUINN,"""Spokes<u>person</u>."""
160930,L145046,u4631,m306,M.J.,"That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?"
160931,L145001,u4635,m306,QUINN,"So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am."
160932,L145000,u4631,m306,M.J.,"You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up..."
160933,L144953,u4635,m306,QUINN,Nikko?
160934,L144952,u4631,m306,M.J.,Give me Ruben back...
160935,L144951,u4635,m306,QUINN,"Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is."
160936,L144950,u4631,m306,M.J.,Or the F.B.I.?
160937,L144949,u4635,m306,QUINN,You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
160938,L144948,u4631,m306,M.J.,I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
160939,L144947,u4635,m306,QUINN,How'd you get in on the deal?
160940,L144946,u4635,m306,QUINN,You got a suspect...
160941,L144945,u4631,m306,M.J.,The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
160942,L144941,u4631,m306,M.J.,"I gotta have Ruben, and a..."
160943,L144940,u4635,m306,QUINN,"I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here..."
160944,L144858,u4631,m306,M.J.,Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
160945,L144857,u4635,m306,QUINN,"Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?"
160946,L144856,u4631,m306,M.J.,"If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic."
160947,L144855,u4635,m306,QUINN,Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
160948,L144854,u4631,m306,M.J.,"What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together..."
160949,L144853,u4635,m306,QUINN,"M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko."
160950,L144690,u4631,m306,M.J.,Because I think I'm wrong.
160951,L144689,u4635,m306,QUINN,What the hell you need her for?
160952,L144688,u4631,m306,M.J.,Helen Hudson...
160953,L144687,u4635,m306,QUINN,Where you going?
160954,L144686,u4631,m306,M.J.,I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
160955,L144685,u4635,m306,QUINN,"Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation."
160956,L144684,u4631,m306,M.J.,You're damn right I do.
160957,L144683,u4635,m306,QUINN,Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
160958,L144682,u4631,m306,M.J.,"It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests..."
160959,L144681,u4635,m306,QUINN,So what have we got?
160960,L144566,u4635,m306,QUINN,"With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures."
160961,L144565,u4631,m306,M.J.,We could use a little help.
160962,L144564,u4635,m306,QUINN,"What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. ""Let me help you!"""
160963,L144563,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Oh, maaaaan?!"
160964,L144529,u4635,m306,QUINN,Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
160965,L144528,u4631,m306,M.J.,So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
160966,L144527,u4635,m306,QUINN,I know.  Get out here.
160967,L144526,u4631,m306,M.J.,"I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon."
160968,L144525,u4635,m306,QUINN,Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
160969,L144524,u4631,m306,M.J.,Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
160970,L144458,u4631,m306,M.J.,"Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir."
160971,L144457,u4635,m306,QUINN,You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
160972,L144456,u4631,m306,M.J.,Yessir.
160973,L144455,u4635,m306,QUINN,Sergeant?
160974,L144454,u4631,m306,M.J.,"That's always your privilege, sir."
160975,L144453,u4635,m306,QUINN,How about I put Nikko on it?
160976,L144452,u4631,m306,M.J.,Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
160977,L144451,u4635,m306,QUINN,I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
160978,L144450,u4635,m306,QUINN,"Would you step outside, Sergeant?"
160979,L144449,u4631,m306,M.J.,What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
160980,L144448,u4635,m306,QUINN,What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
160981,L144447,u4631,m306,M.J.,The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
160982,L144446,u4635,m306,QUINN,There was no sperm.
160983,L144317,u4631,m306,M.J.,Good.
160984,L144316,u4635,m306,QUINN,"We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass."
160985,L144315,u4631,m306,M.J.,Right.
160986,L144314,u4635,m306,QUINN,This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
160987,L144313,u4631,m306,M.J.,Right.
160988,L144312,u4635,m306,QUINN,You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
160989,L144308,u4635,m306,QUINN,I said you were...
160990,L144307,u4631,m306,M.J.,Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
160991,L144306,u4635,m306,QUINN,I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
160992,L144303,u4635,m306,QUINN,Shut up.
160993,L144302,u4631,m306,M.J.,You messed with the scene.
160994,L144658,u4631,m306,M.J.,We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
160995,L144657,u4638,m306,SUSAN,"Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?"
160996,L144655,u4638,m306,SUSAN,"What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?"
160997,L144654,u4631,m306,M.J.,Detective Niccoletti?
160998,L144305,u4631,m306,M.J.,You messed with the evidence.
160999,L144304,u4638,m306,SUSAN,"... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence..."
161000,L144268,u4631,m306,M.J.,I just got here.  Talk to you later...
161001,L144267,u4638,m306,SUSAN,...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
161002,L144266,u4631,m306,M.J.,"I just got here myself, Susan."
161003,L144678,u4635,m306,QUINN,What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
161004,L144677,u4633,m306,NIKKO,I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
161005,L144676,u4635,m306,QUINN,"Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?"
161006,L144675,u4633,m306,NIKKO,She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
161007,L144674,u4635,m306,QUINN,"Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?"
161008,L144673,u4633,m306,NIKKO,"We were together six years, sir!"
161009,L144672,u4635,m306,QUINN,"She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it."
161010,L144671,u4633,m306,NIKKO,He's not treating her right...
161011,L144626,u4639,m306,WOMAN,That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
161012,L144625,u4634,m306,PETER,She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
161013,L144624,u4639,m306,WOMAN,She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
161014,L144623,u4634,m306,PETER,"Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again."
161015,L144622,u4639,m306,WOMAN,"See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?"
161016,L144621,u4639,m306,WOMAN,You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself.  Where're you?
161017,L144620,u4634,m306,PETER,Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
161018,L144619,u4639,m306,WOMAN,Put in the Kevin Costner.
161019,L145685,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,James.
161020,L145684,u4642,m307,JAMES,I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
161021,L145679,u4642,m307,JAMES,Not yet. It's only beginning.
161022,L145678,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,I'd like to go back. James...
161023,L145677,u4642,m307,JAMES,The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
161024,L145675,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,One of my suitors.
161025,L145674,u4642,m307,JAMES,One of your suitors?
161026,L145673,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
161027,L145671,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
161028,L145670,u4642,m307,JAMES,"I thought that was you, up there."
161029,L145649,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?"
161030,L145648,u4642,m307,JAMES,At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
161031,L145647,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
161032,L145646,u4642,m307,JAMES,Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
161033,L145645,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
161034,L145618,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty..."
161035,L145617,u4642,m307,JAMES,I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
161036,L145616,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,Have you seen his penis?
161037,L145615,u4642,m307,JAMES,No. But when he's in that car...
161038,L145614,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?"
161039,L145613,u4642,m307,JAMES,He's very pale. Covered with scars.
161040,L145612,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,Do you find him attractive?
161041,L145611,u4642,m307,JAMES,It does.
161042,L145610,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
161043,L145520,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?"
161044,L145519,u4642,m307,JAMES,You're not envious?
161045,L145518,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
161046,L145517,u4642,m307,JAMES,I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
161047,L145516,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
161048,L145515,u4642,m307,JAMES,Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
161049,L145514,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
161050,L145513,u4642,m307,JAMES,I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
161051,L145512,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
161052,L145511,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her."
161053,L145510,u4642,m307,JAMES,What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
161054,L145509,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
161055,L145508,u4642,m307,JAMES,You should have gone to the funeral.
161056,L145507,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids."
161057,L145499,u4642,m307,JAMES,"After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident."
161058,L145498,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,It is?
161059,L145497,u4642,m307,JAMES,It's about time.
161060,L145496,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
161061,L145495,u4642,m307,JAMES,Have you seen it?
161062,L145494,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station."
161063,L145493,u4642,m307,JAMES,What!? They brought the car here?
161064,L145492,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"Outside in the visitors, car park."
161065,L145491,u4642,m307,JAMES,Where's the car?
161066,L145485,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
161067,L145484,u4642,m307,JAMES,And her husband? What was he?
161068,L145483,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk."
161069,L145482,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk."
161070,L145481,u4642,m307,JAMES,"That's going well, then."
161071,L145480,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you."
161072,L145479,u4642,m307,JAMES,Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
161073,L145478,u4642,m307,JAMES,I'll listen for you buzzing over.
161074,L145477,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
161075,L145476,u4642,m307,JAMES,They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
161076,L145475,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,Not a lot of action here.
161077,L145474,u4642,m307,JAMES,Thank you.
161078,L145473,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,"There, that's better."
161079,L145472,u4642,m307,JAMES,"I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen."
161080,L145471,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
161081,L145470,u4642,m307,JAMES,We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
161082,L145469,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
161083,L145468,u4642,m307,JAMES,Did you come?
161084,L145467,u4640,m307,CATHERINE,In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
161085,L145466,u4642,m307,JAMES,Where were you?
161086,L145625,u4641,m307,HELEN,Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
161087,L145624,u4642,m307,JAMES,And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
161088,L145623,u4641,m307,HELEN,Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
161089,L145622,u4642,m307,JAMES,And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
161090,L145621,u4641,m307,HELEN,"The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage."
161091,L145620,u4642,m307,JAMES,Please finish your story.
161092,L145585,u4641,m307,HELEN,I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
161093,L145584,u4642,m307,JAMES,Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
161094,L145579,u4641,m307,HELEN,"When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now."
161095,L145578,u4642,m307,JAMES,"Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash."
161096,L145577,u4641,m307,HELEN,That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
161097,L145576,u4642,m307,JAMES,Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
161098,L145562,u4641,m307,HELEN,"That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment."
161099,L145561,u4642,m307,JAMES,Isn't that rather too close...?
161100,L145560,u4641,m307,HELEN,Yes.
161101,L145559,u4642,m307,JAMES,The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
161102,L145558,u4641,m307,HELEN,"We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case."
161103,L145557,u4641,m307,HELEN,"I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. ""Anywhere"", I said."
161104,L145554,u4642,m307,JAMES,Are we imagining it?
161105,L145553,u4641,m307,HELEN,"It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic."
161106,L145552,u4642,m307,JAMES,Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
161107,L145551,u4641,m307,HELEN,Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
161108,L145550,u4641,m307,HELEN,I work in the immigration department there.
161109,L145549,u4642,m307,JAMES,So - why the airport?
161110,L145548,u4641,m307,HELEN,I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
161111,L145547,u4642,m307,JAMES,I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
161112,L145546,u4641,m307,HELEN,"Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy."
161113,L145545,u4642,m307,JAMES,The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
161114,L145544,u4641,m307,HELEN,"Haven't I? To the airport, if you could."
161115,L145543,u4642,m307,JAMES,You haven't told me where we're going.
161116,L145542,u4642,m307,JAMES,Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again.
161117,L145541,u4641,m307,HELEN,"Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped."
161118,L145540,u4642,m307,JAMES,I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
161119,L145537,u4641,m307,HELEN,They said it was here. They told me this morning.
161120,L145536,u4642,m307,JAMES,It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
161121,L145535,u4641,m307,HELEN,"After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car."
161122,L145644,u4642,m307,JAMES,"No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan."
161123,L145643,u4643,m307,RENATA,I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
161124,L145642,u4642,m307,JAMES,Hard to say.
161125,L145641,u4643,m307,RENATA,What does he want from you?
161126,L145570,u4642,m307,JAMES,"You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together."
161127,L145569,u4643,m307,RENATA,"Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you."
161128,L145568,u4642,m307,JAMES,You're kidding.
161129,L145567,u4643,m307,RENATA,"I suspect it involves reenactments of famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert Camus..."
161130,L145566,u4642,m307,JAMES,Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
161131,L145565,u4643,m307,RENATA,A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
161132,L145564,u4642,m307,JAMES,What is it?
161133,L145530,u4642,m307,JAMES,I can drive.
161134,L145529,u4643,m307,RENATA,Can you drive?
161135,L145527,u4643,m307,RENATA,Are you still involving me in your crash?
161136,L145526,u4642,m307,JAMES,You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
161137,L145525,u4643,m307,RENATA,I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
161138,L145524,u4642,m307,JAMES,There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
161139,L145523,u4643,m307,RENATA,I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
161140,L145522,u4642,m307,JAMES,No.
161141,L145521,u4643,m307,RENATA,Are we allowed to park here?
161142,L145662,u4642,m307,JAMES,Where are you?
161143,L145661,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,"I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project."
161144,L145654,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,"You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area."
161145,L145653,u4642,m307,JAMES,"He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood."
161146,L145637,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
161147,L145636,u4642,m307,JAMES,What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
161148,L145635,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,"It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project."
161149,L145634,u4642,m307,JAMES,It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
161150,L145632,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,The case could be made.
161151,L145631,u4642,m307,JAMES,Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
161152,L145630,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,"No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else."
161153,L145629,u4642,m307,JAMES,You could get your wish at any moment.
161154,L145628,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
161155,L145607,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
161156,L145606,u4642,m307,JAMES,"What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?"
161157,L145602,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,I live in my car. This is my workshop.
161158,L145601,u4642,m307,JAMES,Do you live here? With Seagrave?
161159,L145593,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
161160,L145592,u4642,m307,JAMES,Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
161161,L145503,u4642,m307,JAMES,Yes.
161162,L145502,u4644,m307,VAUGHAN,Crash victim?
161163,L146393,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,Oh?
161164,L146392,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I have a going-away gesture for you, too."
161165,L146391,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,It was just a little going-away gesture.
161166,L146390,u4646,m308,LETTY,"OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off."
161167,L146389,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me."
161168,L146377,u4646,m308,LETTY,Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
161169,L146376,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well."
161170,L146375,u4646,m308,LETTY,What?
161171,L146374,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"Then, you should call."
161172,L146373,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out."
161173,L146372,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
161174,L146371,u4646,m308,LETTY,But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
161175,L146196,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
161176,L146195,u4646,m308,LETTY,"First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop."
161177,L146194,u4646,m308,LETTY,I don't want to hear anymore.
161178,L146193,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of..."
161179,L146192,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication."
161180,L146191,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes."
161181,L146190,u4646,m308,LETTY,I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
161182,L146189,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with."
161183,L146188,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur."
161184,L146187,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
161185,L146186,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself."
161186,L146185,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital."
161187,L146184,u4646,m308,LETTY,I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
161188,L146117,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I miss Beast a lot, too."
161189,L146116,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?"
161190,L146115,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
161191,L146114,u4646,m308,LETTY,The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
161192,L146037,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others."
161193,L146036,u4646,m308,LETTY,Do we have to talk about this?
161194,L145954,u4646,m308,LETTY,I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
161195,L145953,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
161196,L145952,u4646,m308,LETTY,I want to see my mother immediately.
161197,L145951,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some..."
161198,L145950,u4646,m308,LETTY,What kind of place is this?
161199,L145949,u4646,m308,LETTY,What?
161200,L145948,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,Patient.
161201,L145947,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Psychologist, therapist, whatever."
161202,L145946,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
161203,L145945,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Yeah, and a dimple."
161204,L145944,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?"
161205,L145943,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest."
161206,L145942,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
161207,L145941,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,It's hospital policy...
161208,L145940,u4646,m308,LETTY,I did this already.
161209,L145939,u4645,m308,DR. EMLEE,"Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you..."
161210,L146586,u4653,m308,RUTH,I know.    I know.
161211,L146585,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth."
161212,L146584,u4646,m308,LETTY,I can't.    I can't see him there.
161213,L146583,u4653,m308,RUTH,Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
161214,L146582,u4646,m308,LETTY,But what am I going to do?
161215,L146581,u4653,m308,RUTH,You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
161216,L146580,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?"
161217,L146577,u4646,m308,LETTY,I ruined your wedding night.
161218,L146576,u4653,m308,RUTH,You did the right thing.
161219,L146533,u4653,m308,RUTH,That's thanks to all your help.
161220,L146532,u4646,m308,LETTY,I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
161221,L146140,u4646,m308,LETTY,I didn't say...
161222,L146139,u4653,m308,RUTH,"What's his name, Letty?"
161223,L146135,u4653,m308,RUTH,"Oh, no, of course not."
161224,L146134,u4646,m308,LETTY,Do we have to talk wedding details?
161225,L146133,u4653,m308,RUTH,And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
161226,L146132,u4646,m308,LETTY,Ecru.
161227,L146131,u4653,m308,RUTH,What do you think?
161228,L146130,u4653,m308,RUTH,Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
161229,L146129,u4646,m308,LETTY,You're slowing.
161230,L146128,u4653,m308,RUTH,I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
161231,L146127,u4646,m308,LETTY,That settles it. I'm never leaving.
161232,L146126,u4653,m308,RUTH,Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
161233,L146125,u4646,m308,LETTY,I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
161234,L145896,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'll be back before you can say souffle.
161235,L145895,u4653,m308,RUTH,"Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle..."
161236,L145887,u4646,m308,LETTY,"No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate."
161237,L145886,u4653,m308,RUTH,It'll be fine.
161238,L145885,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes."
161239,L145884,u4653,m308,RUTH,What's all the dreck?
161240,L145881,u4653,m308,RUTH,What's the matter?
161241,L145880,u4646,m308,LETTY,Fuck me.
161242,L145877,u4653,m308,RUTH,What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
161243,L145876,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?"
161244,L145875,u4653,m308,RUTH,How can I help?
161245,L145855,u4646,m308,LETTY,Do you think I should?
161246,L145854,u4653,m308,RUTH,"Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you."
161247,L145845,u4653,m308,RUTH,"Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress."
161248,L145844,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Hi, Mom."
161249,L145843,u4646,m308,LETTY,Truly.
161250,L145842,u4653,m308,RUTH,Really?
161251,L145841,u4646,m308,LETTY,You look beautiful.
161252,L145840,u4653,m308,RUTH,What about this one?
161253,L145838,u4653,m308,RUTH,"Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it."
161254,L145837,u4646,m308,LETTY,Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
161255,L145836,u4653,m308,RUTH,What about the engagement party?
161256,L145835,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Yeah, everything's under control."
161257,L145834,u4653,m308,RUTH,But everything's OK?
161258,L145833,u4646,m308,LETTY,Things have been kind of stressful lately.
161259,L145831,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'd have to see it on.
161260,L145830,u4653,m308,RUTH,What do you think of this one?
161261,L145829,u4646,m308,LETTY,She said she'd be here at 10.
161262,L145828,u4653,m308,RUTH,Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
161263,L145778,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Yeah, it'll be fun."
161264,L145777,u4653,m308,RUTH,And the party?
161265,L145776,u4646,m308,LETTY,"You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?"
161266,L145775,u4653,m308,RUTH,Really?
161267,L145774,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe."
161268,L145773,u4646,m308,LETTY,Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
161269,L145772,u4653,m308,RUTH,"Please, Letty."
161270,L145771,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going."
161271,L145770,u4653,m308,RUTH,"You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty."
161272,L145769,u4646,m308,LETTY,Maybe.
161273,L145768,u4653,m308,RUTH,Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
161274,L145767,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours."
161275,L145766,u4653,m308,RUTH,How?
161276,L145765,u4646,m308,LETTY,Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
161277,L145764,u4653,m308,RUTH,She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
161278,L145729,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest..."
161279,L145728,u4653,m308,RUTH,"No, really. Tell me about the promotion."
161280,L145725,u4653,m308,RUTH,There's nothing to tell.
161281,L145724,u4646,m308,LETTY,Just go ahead and tell us.
161282,L145720,u4653,m308,RUTH,Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
161283,L145719,u4646,m308,LETTY,What's up with you?
161284,L146522,u4646,m308,LETTY,Just remember that I love him.
161285,L146521,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Don't be fresh.
161286,L146520,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
161287,L146518,u4646,m308,LETTY,"He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away."
161288,L146517,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?"
161289,L146516,u4646,m308,LETTY,Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
161290,L146386,u4646,m308,LETTY,A deal's a deal.
161291,L146385,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"Honestly, Letty."
161292,L146383,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Not even if it's something positive?
161293,L146382,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael."
161294,L146381,u4646,m308,LETTY,I've already made arrangements.
161295,L146380,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will."
161296,L146379,u4646,m308,LETTY,"It's good exercise, Mom."
161297,L146378,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Must you walk so quickly?
161298,L146259,u4646,m308,LETTY,"And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke."
161299,L146258,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,I'm only looking out for you.
161300,L146257,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that."
161301,L146256,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
161302,L146255,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Mom, please."
161303,L146254,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
161304,L146251,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,When did you start smoking?
161305,L146250,u4646,m308,LETTY,I haven't had a crush since I was
161306,L146249,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here."
161307,L146248,u4646,m308,LETTY,"We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom."
161308,L146246,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
161309,L146245,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway."
161310,L146244,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too."
161311,L146243,u4646,m308,LETTY,Which flowers did you order?
161312,L146241,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"You're looking good.    A little thin, but good."
161313,L146240,u4646,m308,LETTY,"You too, Mom."
161314,L146239,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"It's so good to see you, Sweetheart."
161315,L146007,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
161316,L146006,u4646,m308,LETTY,Tomorrow?
161317,L146005,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,I'll see you soon.
161318,L146001,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Paul said he'd call the school.  And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
161319,L146000,u4646,m308,LETTY,And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
161320,L145999,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Ruth's already taken him home.
161321,L145998,u4646,m308,LETTY,But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
161322,L145997,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Yes.
161323,L145996,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while."
161324,L145995,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul."
161325,L145994,u4646,m308,LETTY,I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
161326,L145993,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
161327,L145992,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
161328,L145991,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says..."
161329,L145990,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened."
161330,L145989,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"Oh, Letty, what happened?"
161331,L145988,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
161332,L145987,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK."
161333,L145859,u4646,m308,LETTY,Can I get you a glass of champagne?
161334,L145858,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,I gather he's late as usual.
161335,L145853,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Especially with a promotion in the offing.
161336,L145852,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Mom, please."
161337,L145851,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Paul could pop the question at any time.
161338,L145850,u4646,m308,LETTY,Oh no.
161339,L145848,u4646,m308,LETTY,"No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it."
161340,L145847,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Has Paul heard about his promotion?
161341,L145736,u4646,m308,LETTY,You've only known Jake a few months.
161342,L145735,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Tell us every detail.
161343,L145733,u4646,m308,LETTY,Wow.   Congratulations.
161344,L145732,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
161345,L145727,u4646,m308,LETTY,Come on.
161346,L145726,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"Are you sure, Dear?"
161347,L145718,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program."
161348,L145717,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,Will you get time off to do that?
161349,L145716,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I'll be running it three days a week, and..."
161350,L145715,u4649,m308,MRS. MAYER,"How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?"
161351,L146175,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,I'm glad.
161352,L146174,u4646,m308,LETTY,You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
161353,L146173,u4646,m308,LETTY,I guess so. I think that's right.
161354,L146172,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,You can only do what feels best to you now.
161355,L146168,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
161356,L146167,u4646,m308,LETTY,I don't mean to go on and on like this.
161357,L146162,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
161358,L146161,u4646,m308,LETTY,"To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good."
161359,L146160,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,"If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so."
161360,L146159,u4646,m308,LETTY,Lie?
161361,L146158,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,"I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty."
161362,L146157,u4646,m308,LETTY,Mottled really.   Green and red.
161363,L146156,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,Green spot.
161364,L146155,u4646,m308,LETTY,It had this red spot on its back.
161365,L146153,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
161366,L146152,u4646,m308,LETTY,It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
161367,L146151,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,Yeah?
161368,L146150,u4646,m308,LETTY,There's a spider in my room.
161369,L146149,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,"Letty, you should be in bed."
161370,L145972,u4650,m308,NURSE GATES,Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
161371,L145971,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm really not that hungry.
161372,L146642,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,You should go.
161373,L146641,u4646,m308,LETTY,I guess I should go now.
161374,L146639,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
161375,L146638,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?"
161376,L146637,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
161377,L146636,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,How about something better?   Like a kiss.
161378,L146635,u4646,m308,LETTY,Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
161379,L146634,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
161380,L146633,u4646,m308,LETTY,Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
161381,L146632,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too."
161382,L146631,u4646,m308,LETTY,I love you so much.
161383,L146628,u4646,m308,LETTY,I know I don't want to lose you.     I don't think I could stand it.
161384,L146627,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,What do you want to do?
161385,L146626,u4646,m308,LETTY,What are we going to do?
161386,L146625,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?"
161387,L146624,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
161388,L146623,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
161389,L146622,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I don't know. I don't fucking know.
161390,L146621,u4646,m308,LETTY,Well then why'd it happen?
161391,L146620,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
161392,L146619,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications."
161393,L146618,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
161394,L146617,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Letty, please."
161395,L146616,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see..."
161396,L146615,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Yeah, the plans."
161397,L146614,u4646,m308,LETTY,And all the plans we have.
161398,L146613,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I sure know what that feels like.
161399,L146611,u4646,m308,LETTY,It's hard to know where to start.
161400,L146610,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I guess so.
161401,L146609,u4646,m308,LETTY,I guess we need to talk.
161402,L146569,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK."
161403,L146568,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
161404,L146567,u4646,m308,LETTY,I think I should call someone.
161405,L146566,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Silly, silly, silly."
161406,L146565,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Michael, take it easy."
161407,L146564,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Silly?   Silly am I?
161408,L146563,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly."
161409,L146562,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Why'd you tell?
161410,L146561,u4646,m308,LETTY,What do you mean not taking your meds?
161411,L146560,u4646,m308,LETTY,"We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad."
161412,L146559,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I saw you talking to my Mom.
161413,L146558,u4646,m308,LETTY,What?
161414,L146557,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Always the drugs.
161415,L146556,u4646,m308,LETTY,What is it? Are you OK?
161416,L146549,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,It wasn't exactly a lie.
161417,L146548,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?"
161418,L146546,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,How about a dance?
161419,L146545,u4646,m308,LETTY,When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
161420,L146544,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Something like that.
161421,L146530,u4646,m308,LETTY,Bingo.
161422,L146529,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Aunt Lily?
161423,L146527,u4646,m308,LETTY,You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
161424,L146526,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?"
161425,L146525,u4646,m308,LETTY,"No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker."
161426,L146524,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
161427,L146514,u4646,m308,LETTY,Congratulations.
161428,L146513,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,How may I help you?
161429,L146512,u4646,m308,LETTY,I got worried. Are you OK?
161430,L146511,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer."
161431,L146501,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Coming.
161432,L146500,u4646,m308,LETTY,You're going to miss the Top Ten.
161433,L146499,u4646,m308,LETTY,I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
161434,L146498,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
161435,L146496,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"You don't have to take care of me, you know."
161436,L146495,u4646,m308,LETTY,That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
161437,L146494,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I couldn't even face that one.
161438,L146493,u4646,m308,LETTY,"The restaurant, too?"
161439,L146492,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Four interviews. Four no-gos.
161440,L146480,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
161441,L146479,u4646,m308,LETTY,Are you OK?
161442,L146478,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I think I should go home.
161443,L146477,u4646,m308,LETTY,You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
161444,L146476,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
161445,L146475,u4646,m308,LETTY,You got wine. That's great.
161446,L146474,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,The store was busy.
161447,L146469,u4646,m308,LETTY,Steak?
161448,L146468,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Promise.  As long as we have steak.
161449,L146467,u4646,m308,LETTY,Promise?
161450,L146466,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
161451,L146465,u4646,m308,LETTY,Who ever said sanity was fun?
161452,L146464,u4646,m308,LETTY,Yeah.    How was the job search?
161453,L146463,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Sounds grim.
161454,L146462,u4646,m308,LETTY,I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
161455,L146461,u4646,m308,LETTY,That's Mr. Beast to you.
161456,L146460,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,This must be Beast.
161457,L146459,u4646,m308,LETTY,Thanks.
161458,L146458,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Gosh, Letty, this is a great place."
161459,L146439,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,You've got one hell of a great body.
161460,L146438,u4646,m308,LETTY,Yeah?
161461,L146437,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?"
161462,L146435,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"You, too. Kick ass today."
161463,L146434,u4646,m308,LETTY,Good luck.
161464,L146433,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I'll see you tonight.
161465,L146432,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
161466,L146430,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I'll be forced to tickle you.
161467,L146429,u4646,m308,LETTY,Not yet.
161468,L146427,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Shhhh.
161469,L146426,u4646,m308,LETTY,Michael.
161470,L146425,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,No.
161471,L146424,u4646,m308,LETTY,Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
161472,L146422,u4646,m308,LETTY,It's sex time.
161473,L146421,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Hey.
161474,L146420,u4646,m308,LETTY,You're so wrong.
161475,L146419,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I like it.     But Headlines are better.
161476,L146418,u4646,m308,LETTY,How can you not like the Top 10 List?
161477,L146417,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
161478,L146416,u4646,m308,LETTY,What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
161479,L146415,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Really?
161480,L146414,u4646,m308,LETTY,I love your apartment.
161481,L146413,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Do you like it?
161482,L146412,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,You've got to see the kitchen first.
161483,L146411,u4646,m308,LETTY,Let's try out the bed.
161484,L146410,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
161485,L146409,u4646,m308,LETTY,It's TV heaven.
161486,L146408,u4646,m308,LETTY,Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
161487,L146407,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing."
161488,L146406,u4646,m308,LETTY,I love the pillows.
161489,L146405,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,You like it?
161490,L146404,u4646,m308,LETTY,Wow.
161491,L146402,u4646,m308,LETTY,Open up.    I want to see.
161492,L146401,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
161493,L146400,u4646,m308,LETTY,I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
161494,L146399,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Where to?
161495,L146398,u4646,m308,LETTY,Aren't you ever quiet?
161496,L146397,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
161497,L146362,u4646,m308,LETTY,List schmist. You'll remember.
161498,L146361,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I better make a list.
161499,L146360,u4646,m308,LETTY,"First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?"
161500,L146359,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"No, I need some serious household advice."
161501,L146358,u4646,m308,LETTY,Furnished?
161502,L146357,u4646,m308,LETTY,All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
161503,L146356,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"So, it's over?"
161504,L146355,u4646,m308,LETTY,Yeah.
161505,L146354,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
161506,L146353,u4646,m308,LETTY,Just checking.
161507,L146352,u4646,m308,LETTY,And did you go to the mission?
161508,L146351,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Not a one.
161509,L146350,u4646,m308,LETTY,So there were no problems?
161510,L146349,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane."
161511,L146348,u4646,m308,LETTY,Tell me all.
161512,L146346,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Home free.
161513,L146345,u4646,m308,LETTY,Well?
161514,L146309,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck."
161515,L146308,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?"
161516,L146307,u4646,m308,LETTY,John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
161517,L146305,u4646,m308,LETTY,"But I do.     I love you, too."
161518,L146304,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
161519,L146303,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Michael, I..."
161520,L146302,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I do.
161521,L146301,u4646,m308,LETTY,Do you?
161522,L146300,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, ""It's a good thing I love you."""
161523,L146299,u4646,m308,LETTY,Your family just met me.
161524,L146298,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,It's a good thing my family loves you.
161525,L146297,u4646,m308,LETTY,Lie down.
161526,L146296,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Then it's over.
161527,L146295,u4646,m308,LETTY,I don't like lamb.
161528,L146294,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Tell the doctor.
161529,L146293,u4646,m308,LETTY,I have a terrible confession.
161530,L146292,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
161531,L146291,u4646,m308,LETTY,And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
161532,L146290,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
161533,L146289,u4646,m308,LETTY,What else would you do?
161534,L146287,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,That's where I always go when I get out.
161535,L146286,u4646,m308,LETTY,No way.
161536,L146285,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,The mission up in Santa Barbara.
161537,L146284,u4646,m308,LETTY,I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
161538,L146283,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
161539,L146216,u4646,m308,LETTY,Break up?    They wish.
161540,L146215,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
161541,L146214,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones."
161542,L146213,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
161543,L146212,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I wish I could have seen that.
161544,L146211,u4646,m308,LETTY,Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
161545,L146210,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Shocking, huh?"
161546,L146209,u4646,m308,LETTY,What are the delusions like?
161547,L146208,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes."
161548,L146207,u4646,m308,LETTY,Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
161549,L146206,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,What's my rap?
161550,L146205,u4646,m308,LETTY,Wow.    I'm bad news.
161551,L146204,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery."
161552,L146203,u4646,m308,LETTY,Really?    Me too.
161553,L146202,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
161554,L146201,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
161555,L146200,u4646,m308,LETTY,Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
161556,L146199,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,A rose is a rose.
161557,L146198,u4646,m308,LETTY,The lady knows this is a dandelion.
161558,L146197,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,A daisy for the lady.
161559,L146148,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
161560,L146147,u4646,m308,LETTY,Don't be ridiculous.
161561,L146146,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
161562,L146145,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,No rounds for another three hours.
161563,L146144,u4646,m308,LETTY,We'll get caught.
161564,L146143,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Exactly.
161565,L146142,u4646,m308,LETTY,We're supposed to be asleep.
161566,L146109,u4646,m308,LETTY,And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
161567,L146108,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,No.
161568,L146107,u4646,m308,LETTY,I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
161569,L146106,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,A small price.
161570,L146105,u4646,m308,LETTY,Good God.
161571,L146104,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,For a price.
161572,L146103,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"OK, OK, I'll give it back."
161573,L146102,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Really, this isn't funny."
161574,L146098,u4646,m308,LETTY,The left one.
161575,L146097,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Guess.
161576,L146096,u4646,m308,LETTY,Enough with the abracadabra.
161577,L146095,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Guess which hand.
161578,L146093,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,It's magic.
161579,L146092,u4646,m308,LETTY,What have you done with the ring?
161580,L146091,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"So are you engaged, or what?"
161581,L146090,u4646,m308,LETTY,It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
161582,L146089,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Very romantic setting.
161583,L146088,u4646,m308,LETTY,He asked me to marry him.
161584,L146087,u4646,m308,LETTY,Paul.
161585,L146086,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
161586,L146085,u4646,m308,LETTY,Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
161587,L146084,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
161588,L146083,u4646,m308,LETTY,I wasn't hungry.
161589,L146082,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
161590,L146044,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I've already checked it out 17 times.
161591,L146043,u4646,m308,LETTY,But you're checking it out.
161592,L146042,u4646,m308,LETTY,Anything interesting.
161593,L146041,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,What are you looking to read?
161594,L146019,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's..."
161595,L146018,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
161596,L146017,u4646,m308,LETTY,"You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game."
161597,L146016,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Don't take it personally.
161598,L146015,u4646,m308,LETTY,Who do you think you are?
161599,L146014,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,It's no big deal.   We all compare.
161600,L146013,u4646,m308,LETTY,You took bets on my diagnosis?
161601,L146012,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Hey there. They're showing ""Groundhog Day"" if you..."
161602,L145937,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,That must be really difficult.
161603,L145936,u4646,m308,LETTY,"A while, I guess."
161604,L145935,u4646,m308,LETTY,Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
161605,L145934,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,What if it's got a pattern?
161606,L145933,u4646,m308,LETTY,By color.
161607,L145932,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
161608,L145931,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear."
161609,L145930,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Yes?   Go right ahead.
161610,L145928,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
161611,L145927,u4646,m308,LETTY,No.
161612,L145926,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
161613,L145925,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Terrific.
161614,L145924,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Chair, cup and ball."
161615,L145923,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
161616,L145922,u4646,m308,LETTY,"No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous."
161617,L145918,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night."
161618,L145917,u4646,m308,LETTY,I answered these questions last night.
161619,L145916,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?"
161620,L145915,u4646,m308,LETTY,Letty.
161621,L145914,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
161622,L146602,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Sure, I understand."
161623,L146601,u4651,m308,PAUL,"I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind..."
161624,L146600,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm really sorry.
161625,L146599,u4651,m308,PAUL,I think I've heard this speech before.
161626,L146598,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things."
161627,L146597,u4646,m308,LETTY,Michael.   Yes.
161628,L146596,u4651,m308,PAUL,I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
161629,L146595,u4646,m308,LETTY,What?
161630,L146594,u4651,m308,PAUL,I heard about your friend.
161631,L146593,u4646,m308,LETTY,Getting back.
161632,L146592,u4646,m308,LETTY,I start on Monday.
161633,L146591,u4651,m308,PAUL,How's work going?    Are you back at school?
161634,L146590,u4646,m308,LETTY,Oh.
161635,L146589,u4651,m308,PAUL,"Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on."
161636,L146588,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
161637,L146587,u4651,m308,PAUL,I'm glad you agreed to see me.
161638,L146342,u4651,m308,PAUL,No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
161639,L146341,u4646,m308,LETTY,Here's the ring.
161640,L146340,u4651,m308,PAUL,You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
161641,L146339,u4646,m308,LETTY,I love him.
161642,L146338,u4651,m308,PAUL,"Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?"
161643,L146337,u4646,m308,LETTY,He's a patient here.
161644,L146336,u4651,m308,PAUL,"It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin."
161645,L146335,u4646,m308,LETTY,No.
161646,L146334,u4651,m308,PAUL,Have you been seeing another teacher?
161647,L146333,u4646,m308,LETTY,It doesn't matter who.
161648,L146332,u4651,m308,PAUL,Who?
161649,L146331,u4646,m308,LETTY,I've met someone else.
161650,L146330,u4651,m308,PAUL,"Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems."
161651,L146329,u4646,m308,LETTY,I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
161652,L146328,u4651,m308,PAUL,You what?
161653,L146327,u4651,m308,PAUL,That's a load off my mind.
161654,L146326,u4646,m308,LETTY,No...
161655,L146325,u4651,m308,PAUL,You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
161656,L146324,u4646,m308,LETTY,"I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how."
161657,L146323,u4651,m308,PAUL,What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
161658,L146081,u4646,m308,LETTY,Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
161659,L146080,u4651,m308,PAUL,So will you?
161660,L146079,u4646,m308,LETTY,"No, no."
161661,L146078,u4651,m308,PAUL,Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
161662,L146077,u4651,m308,PAUL,"So, what do you say, Let?"
161663,L146076,u4646,m308,LETTY,"No, you've done a perfect job."
161664,L146075,u4646,m308,LETTY,"It's, it's really nice, Paul."
161665,L146074,u4651,m308,PAUL,"I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?"
161666,L146073,u4646,m308,LETTY,Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
161667,L146072,u4651,m308,PAUL,I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
161668,L146070,u4651,m308,PAUL,I just wish we'd done it sooner.
161669,L146069,u4646,m308,LETTY,You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
161670,L146068,u4651,m308,PAUL,Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
161671,L146067,u4646,m308,LETTY,I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
161672,L146066,u4651,m308,PAUL,"I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time..."
161673,L146065,u4651,m308,PAUL,"So, I've been thinking a lot..."
161674,L146064,u4646,m308,LETTY,Especially now.
161675,L146063,u4651,m308,PAUL,Especially this last year.
161676,L146062,u4646,m308,LETTY,No.
161677,L146061,u4651,m308,PAUL,"This has been really difficult, this whole thing."
161678,L146060,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Yes, I suppose so."
161679,L146059,u4651,m308,PAUL,I think we need to talk about some things.
161680,L146058,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?"
161681,L146057,u4646,m308,LETTY,Something you did?
161682,L146056,u4651,m308,PAUL,I hope it wasn't something I did.
161683,L146055,u4646,m308,LETTY,That's a big question.
161684,L146054,u4651,m308,PAUL,Are you all right?
161685,L146053,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Yeah, I guess it's all right."
161686,L146052,u4651,m308,PAUL,It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
161687,L145894,u4651,m308,PAUL,I think you're overreacting.
161688,L145893,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm going to the store.
161689,L145892,u4651,m308,PAUL,Sure. Why?
161690,L145891,u4646,m308,LETTY,Can you loan me a 20?
161691,L145890,u4651,m308,PAUL,What are you doing?
161692,L145872,u4651,m308,PAUL,Yes.
161693,L145871,u4646,m308,LETTY,You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
161694,L145811,u4651,m308,PAUL,You just need to get more organized. L
161695,L145810,u4646,m308,LETTY,Yeah.
161696,L145809,u4651,m308,PAUL,Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
161697,L145808,u4646,m308,LETTY,I don't think so.
161698,L145807,u4651,m308,PAUL,"Come on, Letty.   It'll get done."
161699,L145806,u4646,m308,LETTY,"No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come."
161700,L145805,u4651,m308,PAUL,You can get out of the dinner.
161701,L145804,u4646,m308,LETTY,"It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner."
161702,L145803,u4646,m308,LETTY,"No, it's not like that."
161703,L145802,u4651,m308,PAUL,Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
161704,L145801,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
161705,L145800,u4651,m308,PAUL,Forget I asked.
161706,L145799,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?"
161707,L145798,u4651,m308,PAUL,But what about that math project?
161708,L145797,u4651,m308,PAUL,Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
161709,L145796,u4646,m308,LETTY,I don't feel like going to work today.
161710,L145795,u4651,m308,PAUL,You don't have a fever.
161711,L145794,u4646,m308,LETTY,I'm calling in sick.
161712,L145793,u4651,m308,PAUL,What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
161713,L145756,u4646,m308,LETTY,Sure. Of course.
161714,L145755,u4651,m308,PAUL,"But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?"
161715,L145754,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Oh, ok.   Maybe."
161716,L145753,u4651,m308,PAUL,"Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?"
161717,L145752,u4646,m308,LETTY,I mean tonight.
161718,L145751,u4651,m308,PAUL,I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
161719,L145750,u4651,m308,PAUL,"Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate."
161720,L145749,u4646,m308,LETTY,Yeah?
161721,L145748,u4651,m308,PAUL,Good going. I knew you could do it.
161722,L145747,u4646,m308,LETTY,My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
161723,L145746,u4651,m308,PAUL,The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
161724,L145745,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter."
161725,L145744,u4651,m308,PAUL,I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
161726,L145743,u4646,m308,LETTY,"In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?"
161727,L145742,u4651,m308,PAUL,Can I put these here for tonight?
161728,L145741,u4651,m308,PAUL,She's only known the guy a few months.
161729,L145740,u4646,m308,LETTY,It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
161730,L145739,u4651,m308,PAUL,"So, another one bites the dust."
161731,L146452,u4652,m308,PRINCIPAL GAIL,"Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year."
161732,L146451,u4646,m308,LETTY,Office work?
161733,L146450,u4652,m308,PRINCIPAL GAIL,I need someone to work on budget projections.
161734,L146449,u4646,m308,LETTY,What does that mean?
161735,L146448,u4652,m308,PRINCIPAL GAIL,It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
161736,L146446,u4646,m308,LETTY,I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
161737,L146445,u4652,m308,PRINCIPAL GAIL,I'm glad you're doing well.
161738,L146444,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better."
161739,L146443,u4652,m308,PRINCIPAL GAIL,"I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on..."
161740,L146442,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher."
161741,L146441,u4652,m308,PRINCIPAL GAIL,"So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet."
161742,L146440,u4646,m308,LETTY,"Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor."
161743,L145701,u4646,m308,LETTY,I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
161744,L145700,u4652,m308,PRINCIPAL GAIL,The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
161745,L146266,u4648,m308,MRS. HALLSTROM,"That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do."
161746,L146265,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,"Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa."
161747,L146182,u4648,m308,MRS. HALLSTROM,"Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too."
161748,L146181,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I like those sapphire earrings myself.
161749,L146180,u4648,m308,MRS. HALLSTROM,Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
161750,L146179,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,How's it look?
161751,L145967,u4647,m308,MICHAEL,I'll float you.
161752,L145966,u4648,m308,MRS. HALLSTROM,All tapped out.
161753,L147567,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
161754,L147566,u4667,m309,SAMI,You didn't have to kill Sophie.
161755,L147565,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
161756,L147564,u4667,m309,SAMI,You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
161757,L147544,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,"Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?"
161758,L147543,u4667,m309,SAMI,What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
161759,L147394,u4667,m309,SAMI,And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
161760,L147393,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,"When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook."
161761,L147392,u4667,m309,SAMI,What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
161762,L147391,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
161763,L147390,u4667,m309,SAMI,You didn't have to kill Sophie.
161764,L147389,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
161765,L147388,u4667,m309,SAMI,You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
161766,L147386,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
161767,L147385,u4667,m309,SAMI,They don't have a murder weapon?
161768,L147384,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
161769,L147383,u4667,m309,SAMI,A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
161770,L147382,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,A pass.
161771,L147381,u4667,m309,SAMI,I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
161772,L147380,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Where are the tapes?
161773,L147379,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted."
161774,L147378,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,"You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here."
161775,L147377,u4667,m309,SAMI,Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
161776,L147376,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
161777,L147375,u4667,m309,SAMI,You killed her!
161778,L147374,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
161779,L147373,u4667,m309,SAMI,Wired?    I ain't wired.
161780,L147372,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
161781,L147371,u4667,m309,SAMI,What are you doing?
161782,L147360,u4667,m309,SAMI,"If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue."
161783,L147359,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
161784,L147358,u4667,m309,SAMI,Do you know who this is?
161785,L147357,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Agent Hadley.
161786,L147161,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
161787,L147160,u4667,m309,SAMI,So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
161788,L147159,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,"We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's ""Vase with twelve sunflowers"" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it."
161789,L147185,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
161790,L147184,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Too many people know about my involvement in this.
161791,L147183,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
161792,L147182,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,I thought you wanted Zammito?
161793,L147181,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
161794,L147180,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
161795,L147179,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
161796,L147178,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,"Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI."
161797,L147177,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
161798,L147166,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,You'll never get out of the city.
161799,L147165,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Zero.   That's all I know.
161800,L147218,u4671,m309,WAYNE,"I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris."
161801,L147217,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,"I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?"
161802,L147216,u4671,m309,WAYNE,Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
161803,L147214,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,What?   This?
161804,L147213,u4671,m309,WAYNE,"Hey man, you can't do that!"
161805,L147212,u4671,m309,WAYNE,I dunno.
161806,L147211,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Where did they go?
161807,L147210,u4671,m309,WAYNE,They left about a half hour ago.
161808,L147209,u4654,m309,AGENT HADLEY,Not today.   Where are your friends?
161809,L147208,u4671,m309,WAYNE,"Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?"
161810,L146994,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,Take what you've got and get out of there.
161811,L146993,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Oui.
161812,L146992,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,You've already robbed the safe?
161813,L146991,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Should I call you back?
161814,L146990,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,My number's going to show up on his bill!
161815,L146989,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Oui.
161816,L146988,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,You're calling me on is phone?
161817,L146987,u4663,m309,MARCEL,No.
161818,L146986,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,"You're calling me on your cell phone, right?"
161819,L146985,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Oui.
161820,L146984,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,You're there now?
161821,L146983,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
161822,L146982,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,Marcel?
161823,L146981,u4663,m309,MARCEL,It's me...
161824,L146980,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,Who?
161825,L146979,u4663,m309,MARCEL,It's Elvis...
161826,L146978,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,Hello?
161827,L147640,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes."
161828,L147639,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
161829,L147638,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh."
161830,L147637,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,A million! I don't have that kind of money.
161831,L147636,u4658,m309,DANIEL,-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
161832,L147635,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
161833,L147634,u4658,m309,DANIEL,It's Daniel.
161834,L147633,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,Hello?
161835,L146743,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,"I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment."
161836,L146742,u4658,m309,DANIEL,You don't trust me?
161837,L146741,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,"This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you."
161838,L146740,u4658,m309,DANIEL,What?
161839,L146739,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
161840,L146701,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,"The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow."
161841,L146700,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"C'mon, Laurant, America?"
161842,L146699,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,"Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation."
161843,L146694,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,Good.   I have a job for you in America.
161844,L146693,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"Uh, yeah."
161845,L146692,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
161846,L146682,u4655,m309,BASTALDI,Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
161847,L146681,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Where's your brother?
161848,L146860,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Yeah -- you do that.
161849,L146859,u4656,m309,BOBBY BEANS,I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
161850,L146858,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
161851,L146857,u4656,m309,BOBBY BEANS,To tell you that we're interested in the property.
161852,L146856,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Why are you here?
161853,L146855,u4656,m309,BOBBY BEANS,I'm not here to negotiate.
161854,L146854,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Okay.   How much?
161855,L146853,u4656,m309,BOBBY BEANS,I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
161856,L146852,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
161857,L146851,u4656,m309,BOBBY BEANS,Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
161858,L146850,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,-- Super what?
161859,L146849,u4656,m309,BOBBY BEANS,Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
161860,L146848,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
161861,L146847,u4656,m309,BOBBY BEANS,I'm good.   Really.
161862,L146846,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
161863,L146845,u4656,m309,BOBBY BEANS,No thank you.
161864,L146844,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
161865,L146843,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
161866,L146842,u4656,m309,BOBBY BEANS,Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
161867,L146841,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Good.   I'm good.
161868,L146840,u4656,m309,BOBBY BEANS,"Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?"
161869,L147292,u4657,m309,BONANNO,We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
161870,L147291,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her."
161871,L147290,u4657,m309,BONANNO,What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
161872,L147289,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Yes.
161873,L147288,u4657,m309,BONANNO,They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
161874,L147286,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems."
161875,L147285,u4657,m309,BONANNO,Why didn't you tell me about this?
161876,L146945,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage."
161877,L146944,u4657,m309,BONANNO,But you were there?
161878,L146943,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"I did. Joey ""Two Tons"" and Nicky ""The Rake"" did the deed."
161879,L146942,u4657,m309,BONANNO,Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
161880,L146941,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,He missed three weeks.
161881,L146940,u4657,m309,BONANNO,"Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?"
161882,L146938,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you."
161883,L146937,u4657,m309,BONANNO,You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
161884,L146936,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"Uh, no --"
161885,L146935,u4657,m309,BONANNO,"Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?"
161886,L146934,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Someone else coming?
161887,L146932,u4657,m309,BONANNO,Good word.
161888,L146931,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
161889,L146930,u4657,m309,BONANNO,They're gonna be what?
161890,L146929,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
161891,L146928,u4657,m309,BONANNO,Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
161892,L146927,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off."
161893,L146926,u4657,m309,BONANNO,He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
161894,L146925,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
161895,L146924,u4657,m309,BONANNO,And?
161896,L146923,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
161897,L146922,u4657,m309,BONANNO,I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
161898,L146921,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"No, I'm good, Angelo."
161899,L146920,u4657,m309,BONANNO,"Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?"
161900,L147596,u4657,m309,BONANNO,You have something for me?
161901,L147595,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Thank you.
161902,L147594,u4657,m309,BONANNO,This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
161903,L147541,u4658,m309,DANIEL,How about if I call you?
161904,L147540,u4657,m309,BONANNO,I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
161905,L147539,u4657,m309,BONANNO,Where are you staying?
161906,L147538,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
161907,L147537,u4657,m309,BONANNO,I only have your word for that.
161908,L147536,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
161909,L147535,u4657,m309,BONANNO,And the other half?
161910,L147534,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Half the tapes.
161911,L147533,u4657,m309,BONANNO,And for my help I would get what?
161912,L147532,u4657,m309,BONANNO,You want me to help you get out of the country?
161913,L147531,u4658,m309,DANIEL,We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
161914,L147530,u4657,m309,BONANNO,I assume you want something?
161915,L147529,u4658,m309,DANIEL,He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
161916,L147528,u4657,m309,BONANNO,I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
161917,L147527,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery."
161918,L147522,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
161919,L147521,u4657,m309,BONANNO,You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
161920,L147520,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I guess we're going to find out.
161921,L147519,u4657,m309,BONANNO,"Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?"
161922,L147158,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,"Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors."
161923,L147157,u4658,m309,DANIEL,What kind of business?
161924,L147156,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
161925,L147155,u4658,m309,DANIEL,For what?
161926,L147129,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again."
161927,L147128,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,I don't know.
161928,L146820,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,I know they won't be home tonight.
161929,L146819,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Tonight?
161930,L147464,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Jesus!
161931,L147463,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
161932,L147462,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!"
161933,L147459,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I'm just setting my boundaries.
161934,L147458,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Why is everything an argument with you?
161935,L147457,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I'm not any closer than you are.
161936,L147456,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Because you're the closest.
161937,L147455,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,Why do I always have to answer the phone?
161938,L147454,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"Get that, will you?"
161939,L147278,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
161940,L147277,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,Why not just steal another one?
161941,L147174,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
161942,L147173,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
161943,L147163,u4658,m309,DANIEL,We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
161944,L147162,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
161945,L147106,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
161946,L147105,u4658,m309,DANIEL,We can't.
161947,L147104,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,Yeah.   We just go home.
161948,L146816,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,No problem.
161949,L146815,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one."
161950,L146671,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
161951,L146670,u4658,m309,DANIEL,You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
161952,L147475,u4673,m309,ZERO,And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
161953,L147474,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
161954,L147473,u4673,m309,ZERO,And the Vodka.
161955,L147472,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Bring me the scissors.
161956,L147170,u4673,m309,ZERO,What about the money?
161957,L147169,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I'm going to kill him myself!
161958,L147168,u4673,m309,ZERO,You want Zero to kill him?
161959,L147167,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
161960,L147002,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Cops?
161961,L147001,u4673,m309,ZERO,We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
161962,L146760,u4673,m309,ZERO,"We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass."
161963,L146759,u4658,m309,DANIEL,He said to go fuck yourself.
161964,L146738,u4658,m309,DANIEL,We'll see.
161965,L146737,u4673,m309,ZERO,"And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?"
161966,L146736,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I just want you there in case there's trouble.
161967,L146733,u4673,m309,ZERO,No one? Then why is Zero here?
161968,L146732,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Hopefully no one.
161969,L146727,u4673,m309,ZERO,Where are you from?
161970,L146726,u4658,m309,DANIEL,In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
161971,L147284,u4658,m309,DANIEL,We'll think of something.
161972,L147283,u4661,m309,JULIEN,That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
161973,L147276,u4658,m309,DANIEL,We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
161974,L147275,u4661,m309,JULIEN,What for?
161975,L147274,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us."
161976,L146660,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
161977,L146659,u4661,m309,JULIEN,I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
161978,L146658,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I can't believe you didn't check.
161979,L146657,u4661,m309,JULIEN,I thought they came with batteries.
161980,L146656,u4658,m309,DANIEL,You didn't buy batteries?
161981,L146655,u4661,m309,JULIEN,Do they come with batteries?
161982,L146654,u4661,m309,JULIEN,I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
161983,L146653,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Turn on the flashlight.
161984,L147416,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
161985,L147415,u4658,m309,DANIEL,We still have to get out of here.
161986,L147410,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
161987,L147409,u4663,m309,MARCEL,We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
161988,L147408,u4658,m309,DANIEL,We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
161989,L147239,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?"
161990,L147238,u4663,m309,MARCEL,I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
161991,L147235,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
161992,L147234,u4658,m309,DANIEL,You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
161993,L147231,u4663,m309,MARCEL,This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
161994,L147230,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Do I?
161995,L147229,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
161996,L147224,u4663,m309,MARCEL,"I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's ""Sunflowers in a vase"" I would remember it."
161997,L147223,u4658,m309,DANIEL,You're sure?
161998,L147222,u4663,m309,MARCEL,No.
161999,L147221,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
162000,L147099,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you."
162001,L147098,u4663,m309,MARCEL,The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
162002,L147022,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.
162003,L147021,u4663,m309,MARCEL,It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
162004,L147020,u4658,m309,DANIEL,That moron.
162005,L147000,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I think he's already figured that out.
162006,L146999,u4663,m309,MARCEL,You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
162007,L146698,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
162008,L146697,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"Besides, we don't know the city and--"
162009,L147648,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
162010,L147647,u4667,m309,SAMI,Did you have to use that much explosive?
162011,L147513,u4658,m309,DANIEL,You better.
162012,L147512,u4667,m309,SAMI,I will.
162013,L147511,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
162014,L147510,u4667,m309,SAMI,Does it really matter what I say?
162015,L147509,u4658,m309,DANIEL,You haven't answered my question.
162016,L147508,u4667,m309,SAMI,"No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead."
162017,L147507,u4658,m309,DANIEL,If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
162018,L147506,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?"
162019,L147505,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"Can I trust you, Sami?"
162020,L147504,u4667,m309,SAMI,What?
162021,L147480,u4667,m309,SAMI,Some bread and...
162022,L147479,u4658,m309,DANIEL,What'd you get?
162023,L147478,u4667,m309,SAMI,Anybody hungry?
162024,L147477,u4658,m309,DANIEL,He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
162025,L147476,u4667,m309,SAMI,What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
162026,L147461,u4667,m309,SAMI,Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
162027,L147460,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Hello?
162028,L147435,u4667,m309,SAMI,Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
162029,L147434,u4658,m309,DANIEL,"Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond."
162030,L147407,u4658,m309,DANIEL,No?
162031,L147406,u4667,m309,SAMI,"It's not your fault, Daniel."
162032,L147257,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Has to be.
162033,L147256,u4667,m309,SAMI,Hadley --
162034,L147237,u4658,m309,DANIEL,All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
162035,L147236,u4667,m309,SAMI,"All right, knock it off."
162036,L147228,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
162037,L147227,u4667,m309,SAMI,"It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?"
162038,L147109,u4667,m309,SAMI,We have to find Sophie.
162039,L147108,u4658,m309,DANIEL,You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
162040,L147107,u4667,m309,SAMI,They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
162041,L147088,u4667,m309,SAMI,No.   Chicks dig me.
162042,L147087,u4658,m309,DANIEL,You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
162043,L147086,u4667,m309,SAMI,What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
162044,L147014,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
162045,L147013,u4667,m309,SAMI,"How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?"
162046,L146973,u4667,m309,SAMI,That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
162047,L146972,u4658,m309,DANIEL,It's not?
162048,L146953,u4667,m309,SAMI,I'll be Elvis and you--
162049,L146952,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Good idea.
162050,L146951,u4667,m309,SAMI,We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
162051,L146812,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
162052,L146811,u4667,m309,SAMI,After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
162053,L146723,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five."
162054,L146722,u4658,m309,DANIEL,This is Zero.
162055,L147559,u4658,m309,DANIEL,There's just one more thing I need you to do.
162056,L147558,u4662,m309,LAMAR,"Okay, we're square now, right?"
162057,L147325,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I'll tell you when it's time.
162058,L147324,u4662,m309,LAMAR,What?
162059,L147323,u4658,m309,DANIEL,There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
162060,L147273,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Fine.     Ten o'clock.
162061,L147272,u4662,m309,LAMAR,We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
162062,L147271,u4658,m309,DANIEL,We had a deal.
162063,L147270,u4662,m309,LAMAR,"Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred."
162064,L147269,u4658,m309,DANIEL,-- Did you set it up?
162065,L147268,u4662,m309,LAMAR,Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
162066,L147267,u4658,m309,DANIEL,It's me.
162067,L147266,u4662,m309,LAMAR,Yeah?
162068,L147204,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Fine.
162069,L147203,u4662,m309,LAMAR,A thousand dollars?
162070,L147202,u4658,m309,DANIEL,How much?
162071,L147201,u4662,m309,LAMAR,"And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee."
162072,L147200,u4662,m309,LAMAR,"I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?"
162073,L147199,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Why haven't you turned us in?
162074,L147198,u4662,m309,LAMAR,"Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you."
162075,L147197,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I'm from Belgium.
162076,L147196,u4662,m309,LAMAR,I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
162077,L147195,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I've got a way with people.
162078,L147194,u4662,m309,LAMAR,I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
162079,L147193,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Don't bullshit me.
162080,L147192,u4662,m309,LAMAR,"Man, I can get anything."
162081,L147191,u4658,m309,DANIEL,Guns.   Can you get them?
162082,L147190,u4662,m309,LAMAR,What do you want now?
162083,L147189,u4658,m309,DANIEL,I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
162084,L147114,u4659,m309,HECTOR,Hard to say.
162085,L147113,u4665,m309,RAPHAEL,Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
162086,L147041,u4665,m309,RAPHAEL,"I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?"
162087,L147040,u4659,m309,HECTOR,He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
162088,L147039,u4665,m309,RAPHAEL,"Hector, don't interrupt me."
162089,L147038,u4659,m309,HECTOR,-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
162090,L146905,u4665,m309,RAPHAEL,-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
162091,L146904,u4659,m309,HECTOR,I just thought that--
162092,L146903,u4665,m309,RAPHAEL,"Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car."
162093,L146902,u4659,m309,HECTOR,Maybe you should call the police.
162094,L147593,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Great fuckin' song.

162135,L147004,u4661,m309,JULIEN,What do we do?
162136,L146967,u4663,m309,MARCEL,There must be half a million dollars here though.
162137,L146966,u4661,m309,JULIEN,I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
162138,L146965,u4663,m309,MARCEL,There has to be.
162139,L146919,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Oh yeah.
162140,L146918,u4661,m309,JULIEN,Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.

162144,L147017,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Yes.
162145,L147016,u4661,m309,JULIEN,"Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?"
162146,L147015,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,"No, I didn't."
162147,L146814,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,You can use my car.
162148,L146813,u4661,m309,JULIEN,What about transportation?
162149,L146810,u4661,m309,JULIEN,"I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem."
162150,L146809,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.

162152,L146784,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,They don't have a wine list.
162153,L147280,u4667,m309,SAMI,It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
162154,L147279,u4661,m309,JULIEN,"Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago."
162155,L147262,u4661,m309,JULIEN,That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
162156,L147261,u4667,m309,SAMI,We've got to get out of here.
162157,L147260,u4661,m309,JULIEN,"Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!"

162160,L147101,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that."
162161,L147100,u4661,m309,JULIEN,"I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, ""don't do it! Don't you do it!"" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?"
162162,L147097,u4661,m309,JULIEN,"This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war."
162163,L147096,u4667,m309,SAMI,No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
162164,L147009,u4667,m309,SAMI,"C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money."
162165,L147008,u4661,m309,JULIEN,I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
162166,L146791,u4661,m309,JULIEN,Okay.    I will have a beer.
162167,L146790,u4667,m309,SAMI,This kind.
162168,L146789,u4661,m309,JULIEN,What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
162169,L146788,u4667,m309,SAMI,They don't serve wine here.
162170,L146721,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave."
162171,L146720,u4661,m309,JULIEN,I see.   A master criminal.
162172,L146719,u4667,m309,SAMI,"You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing."
162173,L146718,u4661,m309,JULIEN,"What is it you do, Sami?"
162174,L146717,u4667,m309,SAMI,I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
162175,L147402,u4661,m309,JULIEN,We both know I'm already dead.
162176,L147401,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I'm not going to leave you.
162177,L147400,u4661,m309,JULIEN,When we get to the next corner jump out.
162178,L147398,u4661,m309,JULIEN,Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
162179,L147397,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I knew I should have driven.
162180,L147369,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,This is the only American car you've ever driven.
162181,L147368,u4661,m309,JULIEN,This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
162182,L147367,u4661,m309,JULIEN,I've never driven a Cadillac before.
162183,L147366,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I'm the driver.
162184,L147365,u4661,m309,JULIEN,I'll drive.
162185,L147327,u4661,m309,JULIEN,Relax. It will be fine.
162186,L147326,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
162187,L147079,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
162188,L147078,u4661,m309,JULIEN,"Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days."
162189,L147437,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,"What are we going to do, take a taxi?"
162190,L147436,u4663,m309,MARCEL,How about Canada?
162191,L147414,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
162192,L147413,u4663,m309,MARCEL,No.   How much?
162193,L146679,u4663,m309,MARCEL,How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
162194,L146678,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
162195,L146677,u4663,m309,MARCEL,What the hell is he talking about?
162196,L146676,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
162197,L146675,u4663,m309,MARCEL,"Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd."
162198,L146674,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,"A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther."
162199,L147661,u4667,m309,SAMI,No!
162200,L147660,u4663,m309,MARCEL,"Give it to me, Sami."
162201,L147659,u4667,m309,SAMI,No.
162202,L147658,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
162203,L147653,u4667,m309,SAMI,No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
162204,L147652,u4663,m309,MARCEL,The baseball is mine.
162205,L147651,u4667,m309,SAMI,This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
162206,L147485,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Hey, you know you can't this in France."
162207,L147484,u4663,m309,MARCEL,"God, I want to go home."
162208,L147483,u4667,m309,SAMI,It's good.
162209,L147233,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
162210,L147232,u4667,m309,SAMI,You guys used to work together?
162211,L147226,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
162212,L147225,u4667,m309,SAMI,"""Vase with twelve Sunflowers."""
162213,L146975,u4667,m309,SAMI,
162214,L146974,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
162215,L146971,u4667,m309,SAMI,"No, that's not Mr. Taylor."
162216,L146970,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Mr. Taylor?
162217,L146969,u4667,m309,SAMI,We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
162218,L146957,u4667,m309,SAMI,Okay.   You can be Elvis.
162219,L146956,u4663,m309,MARCEL,"C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do."
162220,L146955,u4667,m309,SAMI,It's my idea.
162221,L146954,u4663,m309,MARCEL,-- I want to be Elvis.
162222,L146712,u4667,m309,SAMI,I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
162223,L146711,u4663,m309,MARCEL,You lived there. You know the city.
162224,L146710,u4667,m309,SAMI,Me?
162225,L146709,u4663,m309,MARCEL,"Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them."
162226,L146708,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Yeah, I can see that."
162227,L146707,u4663,m309,MARCEL,"Today's your lucky day, Sami."
162228,L146704,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run."
162229,L146703,u4663,m309,MARCEL,Going somewhere?
162230,L147490,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I ""sort of"" kill you."
162231,L147489,u4664,m309,"NICKY ""THE RAKE""",They sort of got away.
162232,L147488,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,What happened?
162233,L147298,u4664,m309,"NICKY ""THE RAKE""",Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
162234,L147297,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Get in the car.
162235,L147296,u4664,m309,"NICKY ""THE RAKE""","Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?"
162236,L146864,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,I said a clean break.
162237,L146863,u4664,m309,"NICKY ""THE RAKE""",He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
162238,L146862,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,How's my brother?
162239,L147619,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Fuck me?   Fuck you!
162240,L147618,u4665,m309,RAPHAEL,"Fuck you, grease-ball!"
162241,L147617,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here."
162242,L147616,u4665,m309,RAPHAEL,I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
162243,L147615,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,The hell it is.
162244,L147614,u4665,m309,RAPHAEL,No.   It's mine.
162245,L147613,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Yeah.   It's mine.
162246,L147612,u4665,m309,RAPHAEL,Anybody know about that car outside?
162247,L147581,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
162248,L147580,u4670,m309,VINNY,No shit?
162249,L147579,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
162250,L147578,u4670,m309,VINNY,Yeah.
162251,L147577,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,You see that car?
162252,L147576,u4670,m309,VINNY,How?
162253,L147575,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
162254,L147574,u4670,m309,VINNY,I don't know what you're talking about.
162255,L147573,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,"I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother."
162256,L147572,u4670,m309,VINNY,Uh huh.
162257,L147571,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,Mr. Zammito?
162258,L147188,u4671,m309,WAYNE,Cool.
162259,L147187,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
162260,L147111,u4671,m309,WAYNE,I know where she went.
162261,L147110,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,How are we going to do that?
162262,L146778,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
162263,L146777,u4671,m309,WAYNE,"Yeah, I dig him."
162264,L146776,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,"Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France."
162265,L146775,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,No thank you.
162266,L146774,u4671,m309,WAYNE,"No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?"
162267,L146773,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
162268,L147501,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,Glenmorangie is very good.
162269,L147500,u4667,m309,SAMI,Glenmorangie.
162270,L147499,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,J&amp;B?
162271,L147498,u4667,m309,SAMI,I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
162272,L147497,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
162273,L147412,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,"He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's ""Vase with twelve Sunflowers"" is worth?"
162274,L147411,u4667,m309,SAMI,I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
162275,L147264,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,"Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us."
162276,L147263,u4667,m309,SAMI,You're not helping.
162277,L147241,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
162278,L147240,u4667,m309,SAMI,"I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on."
162279,L147127,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Where is it, Sophie?"
162280,L147126,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,The money isn't here.
162281,L147116,u4667,m309,SAMI,Wait here.
162282,L147115,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,How do we know what room she's in?
162283,L147093,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,What?
162284,L147092,u4667,m309,SAMI,Holy shit.
162285,L146916,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Oh, you think?"
162286,L146915,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,I think we went the wrong way.
162287,L146901,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,Watch this.
162288,L146900,u4667,m309,SAMI,I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
162289,L146735,u4666,m309,RAYMOND,Feel free to correct him if you want.
162290,L146734,u4667,m309,SAMI,He speaks about himself in the third person?
162291,L147419,u4667,m309,SAMI,He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
162292,L147418,u4673,m309,ZERO,"They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key."
162293,L147282,u4667,m309,SAMI,I don't know.
162294,L147281,u4673,m309,ZERO,And how do we do that?
162295,L147172,u4673,m309,ZERO,We don't know that for sure.
162296,L147171,u4667,m309,SAMI,It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
162297,L147138,u4667,m309,SAMI,You wanna tell him?
162298,L147137,u4673,m309,ZERO,What does arresting us get them?
162299,L147136,u4667,m309,SAMI,"They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us."
162300,L146826,u4673,m309,ZERO,How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
162301,L146825,u4667,m309,SAMI,I can't even hear myself think.
162302,L146767,u4673,m309,ZERO,Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
162303,L146766,u4667,m309,SAMI,You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
162304,L146731,u4673,m309,ZERO,-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
162305,L146730,u4667,m309,SAMI,"Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --"
162306,L146729,u4673,m309,ZERO,And you don't speak French?
162307,L146728,u4667,m309,SAMI,Algeria.
162308,L147154,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
162309,L147153,u4667,m309,SAMI,Why?
162310,L147131,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Stick around and find out.
162311,L147130,u4667,m309,SAMI,Who are you waiting for?
162312,L147125,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,After last night I could say the same for you.
162313,L147124,u4667,m309,SAMI,I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
162314,L147071,u4667,m309,SAMI,It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
162315,L147070,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Sounds boring.
162316,L147069,u4667,m309,SAMI,I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
162317,L147068,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,What are you doing?
162318,L147067,u4667,m309,SAMI,It's not your fault.
162319,L147066,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
162320,L147065,u4667,m309,SAMI,No.
162321,L147064,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Can't sleep?
162322,L146891,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,The lucky ones.
162323,L146890,u4667,m309,SAMI,Who's gonna see it there?
162324,L146889,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,"I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass."
162325,L146888,u4667,m309,SAMI,It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
162326,L146887,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
162327,L146886,u4667,m309,SAMI,No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
162328,L146885,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,You got it in a bar?
162329,L146884,u4667,m309,SAMI,I don't remember.    I was drunk.
162330,L146883,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
162331,L146882,u4667,m309,SAMI,You ask a lot of questions.
162332,L146881,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
162333,L146880,u4667,m309,SAMI,Something like that.
162334,L146879,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Did she break your heart?
162335,L146878,u4667,m309,SAMI,Something like that.
162336,L146877,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Casandra. Old girlfriend?
162337,L146875,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,They're not nice people.
162338,L146874,u4667,m309,SAMI,So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
162339,L146873,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
162340,L146872,u4667,m309,SAMI,Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
162341,L146871,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,"So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?"
162342,L146870,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
162343,L146869,u4667,m309,SAMI,"No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight."
162344,L146868,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,You like shoes?
162345,L146822,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Take a nap.
162346,L146821,u4667,m309,SAMI,You ever hear of jet lag?
162347,L146818,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,Tonight.
162348,L146817,u4667,m309,SAMI,When do we go?
162349,L146771,u4667,m309,SAMI,Thanks.
162350,L146770,u4668,m309,SOPHIE,I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
162351,L147607,u4670,m309,VINNY,I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
162352,L147606,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Okay.    Okay.
162353,L147605,u4670,m309,VINNY,"I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here."
162354,L147604,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
162355,L147603,u4670,m309,VINNY,It's for you.
162356,L147602,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
162357,L147601,u4670,m309,VINNY,A car.
162358,L147600,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,What's this?
162359,L147351,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that."
162360,L147350,u4670,m309,VINNY,You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
162361,L147349,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you."
162362,L147348,u4670,m309,VINNY,A little?
162363,L147347,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
162364,L147346,u4670,m309,VINNY,"Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?"
162365,L147345,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
162366,L147344,u4670,m309,VINNY,You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
162367,L147343,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?"
162368,L147342,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
162369,L147341,u4670,m309,VINNY,She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
162370,L147340,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,She seems pleasant enough.
162371,L146808,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,That's why we're only breaking one arm.
162372,L146807,u4670,m309,VINNY,"Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!"
162373,L146806,u4672,m309,ZAMMITO,"-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm."
162374,L146805,u4670,m309,VINNY,"Frankie, I --"
162375,L148159,u4674,m310,AUNT WU,"Well, Li Mu Bai can do it."
162376,L148158,u4688,m310,YU,I didn't have the heart.
162377,L148157,u4674,m310,AUNT WU,She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
162378,L148116,u4674,m310,AUNT WU,I'll go and make up his room!
162379,L148115,u4688,m310,YU,Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
162380,L148114,u4674,m310,AUNT WU,Much better.  You've been gone so long.
162381,L148113,u4688,m310,YU,How's the arm?  Still sore?
162382,L148112,u4674,m310,AUNT WU,You're back!
162383,L147832,u4687,m310,TSAI,"Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me."
162384,L147831,u4675,m310,BO,Then leave her to me.
162385,L147830,u4687,m310,TSAI,Yes.
162386,L147829,u4675,m310,BO,This Jade Fox is a woman?
162387,L147828,u4687,m310,TSAI,"I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her."
162388,L147827,u4675,m310,BO,Why were you spying on the Yus?
162389,L147826,u4687,m310,TSAI,I don't care about your sword.
162390,L147825,u4675,m310,BO,Wait!  I'm a friend!
162391,L147824,u4687,m310,TSAI,Who are you?
162392,L147945,u4682,m310,LI,"That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you."
162393,L147944,u4676,m310,FIGURE,And if I use them to kill you?
162394,L147943,u4682,m310,LI,I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
162395,L147942,u4676,m310,FIGURE,Why do you want to teach me?
162396,L147941,u4682,m310,LI,"Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness."
162397,L147940,u4676,m310,FIGURE,Go ahead.
162398,L147938,u4682,m310,LI,Real sharpness comes without effort.
162399,L147937,u4676,m310,FIGURE,On guard!
162400,L147936,u4682,m310,LI,Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
162401,L147935,u4676,m310,FIGURE,Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
162402,L147934,u4682,m310,LI,"Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind."
162403,L147933,u4676,m310,FIGURE,Do you think you are a real master?
162404,L147931,u4676,m310,FIGURE,What's it to you?
162405,L147930,u4682,m310,LI,Where's your master?
162406,L147929,u4676,m310,FIGURE,I do as I please.
162407,L147928,u4682,m310,LI,Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
162408,L147888,u4677,m310,FIGURE IN BLACK,Let's go!
162409,L147887,u4682,m310,LI,"Tell me, who is your master?"
162410,L147886,u4677,m310,FIGURE IN BLACK,I'm just playing around.
162411,L147885,u4682,m310,LI,"My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that ""Xuan Piu"" move?"
162412,L147884,u4677,m310,FIGURE IN BLACK,What's it to you?
162413,L147883,u4682,m310,LI,Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
162414,L147963,u4678,m310,FOX,"Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you!"
162415,L147962,u4681,m310,JEN,"Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from."
162416,L147961,u4678,m310,FOX,"If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me."
162417,L147960,u4681,m310,JEN,"You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you."
162418,L147959,u4678,m310,FOX,I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
162419,L147958,u4681,m310,JEN,You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
162420,L147957,u4678,m310,FOX,"Yes, you do!  You are still my disciple."
162421,L147956,u4681,m310,JEN,I owe you nothing.
162422,L147955,u4678,m310,FOX,"It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?"
162423,L147954,u4681,m310,JEN,Shut up!
162424,L147953,u4678,m310,FOX,Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
162425,L147952,u4681,m310,JEN,That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
162426,L147951,u4678,m310,FOX,You're already a thief.
162427,L147950,u4681,m310,JEN,I'll never live as a thief!
162428,L147949,u4678,m310,FOX,"They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule."
162429,L147948,u4681,m310,JEN,Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
162430,L147947,u4678,m310,FOX,You're home late... or should I say early?
162431,L148067,u4681,m310,JEN,He is my defeated foe!
162432,L148066,u4679,m310,GANGSTER A,Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
162433,L148064,u4681,m310,JEN,So what if I don't?
162434,L148063,u4679,m310,GANGSTER A,You don't seem to understand.
162435,L148062,u4681,m310,JEN,Don't bother.
162436,L148061,u4679,m310,GANGSTER A,"In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance."
162437,L148058,u4681,m310,JEN,Long.
162438,L148057,u4679,m310,GANGSTER A,Hello.  What is your name?
162439,L147798,u4681,m310,JEN,I have a guest.
162440,L147797,u4680,m310,GOVERNESS,This spells trouble.
162441,L147763,u4680,m310,GOVERNESS,Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
162442,L147762,u4681,m310,JEN,It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
162443,L147761,u4680,m310,GOVERNESS,"Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring."
162444,L147760,u4681,m310,JEN,I'm tired now.
162445,L147759,u4680,m310,GOVERNESS,Don't invite danger into your father's house.
162446,L147758,u4681,m310,JEN,I'll socialize with whomever I please.
162447,L147757,u4680,m310,GOVERNESS,She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
162448,L147756,u4681,m310,JEN,Do you know her?
162449,L147755,u4680,m310,GOVERNESS,I heard you met Shu Lien today.
162450,L147754,u4681,m310,JEN,Put them down.
162451,L147753,u4680,m310,GOVERNESS,I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
162452,L147752,u4681,m310,JEN,Please sit.
162453,L148177,u4681,m310,JEN,Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
162454,L148176,u4688,m310,YU,Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
162455,L148171,u4681,m310,JEN,She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
162456,L148170,u4688,m310,YU,You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
162457,L148140,u4681,m310,JEN,Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
162458,L148139,u4688,m310,YU,"Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing."
162459,L148138,u4681,m310,JEN,Come and get it if you can.
162460,L148137,u4688,m310,YU,Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
162461,L148132,u4681,m310,JEN,"What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?"
162462,L148131,u4688,m310,YU,"How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!"
162463,L148130,u4681,m310,JEN,You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
162464,L148129,u4688,m310,YU,Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
162465,L148128,u4681,m310,JEN,Where is he now?
162466,L148127,u4688,m310,YU,He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
162467,L148126,u4681,m310,JEN,You know about Lo?
162468,L148125,u4688,m310,YU,Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
162469,L148124,u4681,m310,JEN,They forced me to marry!
162470,L148123,u4688,m310,YU,"Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents."
162471,L148122,u4681,m310,JEN,"You, sister..."
162472,L148121,u4681,m310,JEN,I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
162473,L148120,u4688,m310,YU,I'll give them to you.
162474,L148119,u4681,m310,JEN,I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
162475,L148118,u4688,m310,YU,Here you must be in proper attire.
162476,L147915,u4688,m310,YU,"Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,"
162477,L147914,u4681,m310,JEN,You say she killed a policeman?
162478,L147821,u4688,m310,YU,"Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage."
162479,L147820,u4681,m310,JEN,"Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters."
162480,L147819,u4688,m310,YU,"I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties."
162481,L147818,u4681,m310,JEN,"Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's."
162482,L147817,u4688,m310,YU,"His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it."
162483,L147816,u4681,m310,JEN,"No, really?"
162484,L147815,u4688,m310,YU,Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
162485,L147814,u4681,m310,JEN,About you and Li Mu Bai?
162486,L147813,u4688,m310,YU,Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
162487,L147812,u4681,m310,JEN,"Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness."
162488,L147811,u4688,m310,YU,You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
162489,L147810,u4681,m310,JEN,I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
162490,L147809,u4688,m310,YU,Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
162491,L147808,u4681,m310,JEN,Please.
162492,L147807,u4681,m310,JEN,Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
162493,L147806,u4688,m310,YU,You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
162494,L147804,u4681,m310,JEN,I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
162495,L147803,u4688,m310,YU,You're doing calligraphy?
162496,L147802,u4681,m310,JEN,I'm bored.
162497,L147801,u4688,m310,YU,How so?
162498,L147800,u4681,m310,JEN,I've missed you.
162499,L147743,u4688,m310,YU,You're probably right.
162500,L147742,u4681,m310,JEN,No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
162501,L147741,u4688,m310,YU,What do you think?
162502,L147740,u4681,m310,JEN,"You're not married, are you?"
162503,L147739,u4688,m310,YU,"So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?"
162504,L147738,u4681,m310,JEN,"You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want."
162505,L147737,u4688,m310,YU,"Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?"
162506,L147736,u4681,m310,JEN,But you're just like the characters in the stories.
162507,L147735,u4688,m310,YU,Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
162508,L147734,u4681,m310,JEN,"I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!"
162509,L147733,u4688,m310,YU,"Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long."
162510,L147732,u4681,m310,JEN,"It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!"
162511,L147731,u4681,m310,JEN,Really?
162512,L147730,u4688,m310,YU,"Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword."
162513,L147729,u4681,m310,JEN,You're a sword fighter too?
162514,L147728,u4688,m310,YU,You're too young to understand.
162515,L147727,u4681,m310,JEN,Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
162516,L147726,u4688,m310,YU,My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
162517,L147725,u4681,m310,JEN,Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
162518,L147724,u4688,m310,YU,"Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old."
162519,L147723,u4681,m310,JEN,"But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful."
162520,L147722,u4688,m310,YU,"The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it."
162521,L147721,u4681,m310,JEN,It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
162522,L148175,u4682,m310,LI,All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
162523,L148174,u4681,m310,JEN,"The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you."
162524,L148155,u4682,m310,LI,Then you have no use for the sword.
162525,L148154,u4681,m310,JEN,Never!
162526,L148153,u4682,m310,LI,Kneel!
162527,L148152,u4681,m310,JEN,Give it back!
162528,L148151,u4681,m310,JEN,"All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you."
162529,L148150,u4682,m310,LI,"What I've always wanted, to teach you."
162530,L148149,u4681,m310,JEN,What do you want?
162531,L148146,u4681,m310,JEN,Only the sword will settle this.
162532,L148145,u4682,m310,LI,Let's end this here.
162533,L148144,u4681,m310,JEN,Not another lecture!  On guard!
162534,L148143,u4682,m310,LI,Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
162535,L148193,u4681,m310,JEN,"Make a wish, Lo."
162536,L148192,u4683,m310,LO,"""A faithful heart makes wishes come true."""
162537,L148191,u4681,m310,JEN,Do you remember the legend of the young man?
162538,L148032,u4681,m310,JEN,Don't ever come back.
162539,L148031,u4683,m310,LO,Jen...
162540,L148030,u4681,m310,JEN,Go.
162541,L148028,u4681,m310,JEN,"If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy."
162542,L148027,u4683,m310,LO,I will.
162543,L148026,u4681,m310,JEN,Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
162544,L148025,u4683,m310,LO,"You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, ""A faithful heart makes wishes come true."""
162545,L148024,u4681,m310,JEN,Don't send me back!
162546,L148023,u4683,m310,LO,It is trouble for me.
162547,L148022,u4681,m310,JEN,Let them look.
162548,L148021,u4683,m310,LO,"Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer."
162549,L148019,u4683,m310,LO,I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
162550,L148018,u4681,m310,JEN,So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
162551,L148017,u4683,m310,LO,"Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier."
162552,L148016,u4681,m310,JEN,"And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb."
162553,L148015,u4683,m310,LO,"When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since."
162554,L148014,u4681,m310,JEN,Give it back.
162555,L148013,u4683,m310,LO,I don't take orders from anyone.
162556,L148012,u4681,m310,JEN,Give me back my comb.
162557,L148011,u4683,m310,LO,I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
162558,L148010,u4681,m310,JEN,"By the way, I'm a real Manchurian."
162559,L148009,u4683,m310,LO,Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
162560,L148008,u4681,m310,JEN,It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
162561,L148007,u4683,m310,LO,No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
162562,L148004,u4683,m310,LO,Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name?
162563,L148003,u4681,m310,JEN,You coward!
162564,L148002,u4683,m310,LO,You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
162565,L147998,u4681,m310,JEN,My comb!
162566,L147997,u4683,m310,LO,"Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning."
162567,L147996,u4683,m310,LO,You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
162568,L147995,u4681,m310,JEN,Give it back!
162569,L147994,u4683,m310,LO,Let's stop a moment.
162570,L147983,u4683,m310,LO,With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
162571,L147982,u4681,m310,JEN,You shouldn't have come.
162572,L147981,u4683,m310,LO,Jen!
162573,L147980,u4681,m310,JEN,Lo?
162574,L148187,u4682,m310,LI,"I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit."
162575,L148186,u4688,m310,YU,Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
162576,L148185,u4682,m310,LI,My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
162577,L148184,u4688,m310,YU,Save your strength.
162578,L148183,u4682,m310,LI,Shu Lien...
162579,L148182,u4688,m310,YU,"Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope..."
162580,L148173,u4688,m310,YU,That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
162581,L148172,u4682,m310,LI,My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
162582,L148165,u4688,m310,YU,We followed Jade Fox.
162583,L148164,u4682,m310,LI,Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
162584,L148163,u4688,m310,YU,What happened?
162585,L148103,u4688,m310,YU,Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
162586,L148102,u4682,m310,LI,I'll look around and catch up later.
162587,L148101,u4688,m310,YU,What about you?
162588,L148100,u4682,m310,LI,We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
162589,L148074,u4682,m310,LI,"You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace."
162590,L148073,u4688,m310,YU,To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
162591,L148072,u4682,m310,LI,"Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble."
162592,L148071,u4682,m310,LI,"Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it."
162593,L148070,u4688,m310,YU,Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
162594,L148069,u4682,m310,LI,Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
162595,L148049,u4682,m310,LI,All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
162596,L148048,u4688,m310,YU,Don't you want to see her again.
162597,L148038,u4682,m310,LI,"She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl."
162598,L148037,u4688,m310,YU,You think Jade Fox will show up?
162599,L147979,u4682,m310,LI,"Just be patient with me, Shu Lien."
162600,L147978,u4688,m310,YU,I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
162601,L147977,u4682,m310,LI,"I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues."
162602,L147976,u4688,m310,YU,"It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object."
162603,L147975,u4682,m310,LI,"For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon."
162604,L147974,u4688,m310,YU,But Wudan does not accept women.
162605,L147973,u4682,m310,LI,That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
162606,L147972,u4688,m310,YU,"She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry."
162607,L147971,u4682,m310,LI,She needs direction... and training.
162608,L147970,u4688,m310,YU,I knew she would intrigue you.
162609,L147969,u4682,m310,LI,"You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night."
162610,L147968,u4688,m310,YU,"My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's."
162611,L147967,u4682,m310,LI,True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
162612,L147966,u4688,m310,YU,But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
162613,L147965,u4682,m310,LI,"I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it."
162614,L147861,u4682,m310,LI,"Well, we had talked..."
162615,L147860,u4688,m310,YU,"Then, why did you come?"
162616,L147859,u4682,m310,LI,I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
162617,L147858,u4688,m310,YU,What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
162618,L147857,u4682,m310,LI,That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
162619,L147856,u4688,m310,YU,"No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods."
162620,L147855,u4682,m310,LI,But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
162621,L147854,u4688,m310,YU,"No, not yet..."
162622,L147853,u4682,m310,LI,Have you questioned him yet?
162623,L147852,u4688,m310,YU,"It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'."
162624,L147851,u4682,m310,LI,It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
162625,L147850,u4688,m310,YU,No.
162626,L147849,u4682,m310,LI,Did you see who posted it?
162627,L147848,u4688,m310,YU,Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
162628,L147847,u4682,m310,LI,So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
162629,L147846,u4688,m310,YU,Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
162630,L147845,u4682,m310,LI,I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
162631,L147844,u4688,m310,YU,You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
162632,L147843,u4682,m310,LI,Jade Fox?  Impossible.
162633,L147842,u4682,m310,LI,What have you discovered?
162634,L147841,u4688,m310,YU,But something is going on at the Yu household.
162635,L147840,u4682,m310,LI,Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
162636,L147694,u4682,m310,LI,Perhaps.
162637,L147693,u4688,m310,YU,Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
162638,L147692,u4682,m310,LI,First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
162639,L147691,u4688,m310,YU,Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
162640,L147690,u4688,m310,YU,So what will you do now?
162641,L147689,u4682,m310,LI,It's time for me to leave it behind.
162642,L147688,u4688,m310,YU,"You use it justly, you're worthy of it."
162643,L147687,u4682,m310,LI,Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
162644,L147686,u4688,m310,YU,I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
162645,L147685,u4682,m310,LI,I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
162646,L147684,u4688,m310,YU,The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
162647,L147683,u4682,m310,LI,Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
162648,L147682,u4688,m310,YU,We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
162649,L147681,u4682,m310,LI,Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
162650,L147680,u4688,m310,YU,What was it?
162651,L147679,u4682,m310,LI,No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
162652,L147678,u4688,m310,YU,You were enlightened?
162653,L147677,u4682,m310,LI,During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
162654,L147676,u4688,m310,YU,Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
162655,L147675,u4682,m310,LI,I left the training early.
162656,L147674,u4688,m310,YU,"The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest."
162657,L147673,u4682,m310,LI,Yes.
162658,L147672,u4688,m310,YU,Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
162659,L147671,u4682,m310,LI,Fine.
162660,L147670,u4688,m310,YU,Good.  And how are you?
162661,L147669,u4682,m310,LI,It has.  How's business?
162662,L147668,u4688,m310,YU,Mu Bai...It's been too long.
162663,L147917,u4688,m310,YU,I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
162664,L147916,u4684,m310,MADAM YU,Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
162665,L147913,u4684,m310,MADAM YU,A female criminal!  Now that's news!
162666,L147912,u4688,m310,YU,"Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down."
162667,L147911,u4684,m310,MADAM YU,A murderer?
162668,L147910,u4688,m310,YU,No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
162669,L147909,u4684,m310,MADAM YU,But don't be too lenient.
162670,L147908,u4688,m310,YU,Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
162671,L147907,u4684,m310,MADAM YU,That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
162672,L147906,u4688,m310,YU,"We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further."
162673,L147905,u4684,m310,MADAM YU,I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
162674,L147904,u4688,m310,YU,I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
162675,L147903,u4684,m310,MADAM YU,Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
162676,L147869,u4685,m310,MAY,Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
162677,L147868,u4687,m310,TSAI,"If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead."

162681,L147773,u4685,m310,MAY,Father!
162682,L147772,u4687,m310,TSAI,You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.

162686,L147901,u4686,m310,SIR TE,What do you have in mind?
162687,L147900,u4688,m310,YU,"Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?"
162688,L147899,u4686,m310,SIR TE,This is a delicate matter.
162689,L147898,u4688,m310,YU,"We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble."
162690,L147786,u4686,m310,SIR TE,Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
162691,L147785,u4688,m310,YU,But the sword could be in his compound.
162692,L147784,u4686,m310,SIR TE,"Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this."
162693,L147783,u4688,m310,YU,Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
162694,L147714,u4686,m310,SIR TE,"When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!"
162695,L147713,u4688,m310,YU,I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
162696,L147712,u4686,m310,SIR TE,"Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time."
162697,L147711,u4688,m310,YU,I don't know...
162698,L147710,u4686,m310,SIR TE,Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?

162700,L147708,u4686,m310,SIR TE,"Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter."
162701,L147707,u4688,m310,YU,You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
162702,L147704,u4686,m310,SIR TE,All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
162703,L147703,u4688,m310,YU,"Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew."
162704,L147702,u4686,m310,SIR TE,"This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it."

162856,L149179,u4695,m311,GIDEON,"Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar."
162857,L149178,u4693,m311,ERIC,T-Bird?
162858,L149177,u4695,m311,GIDEON,"You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar."
162859,L149176,u4693,m311,ERIC,Another jolly nickname?
162860,L149175,u4695,m311,GIDEON,Top Dollar.
162861,L149170,u4693,m311,ERIC,Wrong answer.
162862,L149169,u4695,m311,GIDEON,I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
162863,L149168,u4693,m311,ERIC,"Cute nickname, don't you think?"
162864,L149535,u4697,m311,LAO,"I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine."
162865,L149534,u4693,m311,ERIC,And how many lives have you destroyed?
162866,L149512,u4697,m311,LAO,I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
162867,L149511,u4693,m311,ERIC,You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
162868,L149510,u4697,m311,LAO,"Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them."
162869,L149509,u4697,m311,LAO,I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
162870,L149508,u4693,m311,ERIC,I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
162871,L149507,u4697,m311,LAO,I wish to possess what you have now.
162872,L149501,u4697,m311,LAO,"Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light."
162873,L149500,u4693,m311,ERIC,I can see her.
162874,L149499,u4697,m311,LAO,I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
162875,L149293,u4693,m311,ERIC,Your pain ends now.

162879,L149288,u4694,m311,FUNBOY,"Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!"
162880,L149285,u4694,m311,FUNBOY,"Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself."
162881,L149284,u4693,m311,ERIC,Neither.
162882,L149282,u4693,m311,ERIC,Magic.

162884,L149497,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,"Very well, it's your ass."
162885,L149496,u4693,m311,ERIC,Don't waste my time.
162886,L149492,u4693,m311,ERIC,I'm already alone.
162887,L149491,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,You'll be alone.
162888,L149490,u4693,m311,ERIC,Fine with me.
162889,L149489,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
162890,L149488,u4693,m311,ERIC,Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
162891,L149487,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
162892,L149299,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,Maybe I was wrong about you.
162893,L149298,u4693,m311,ERIC,Shut up.
162894,L149297,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
162895,L149296,u4693,m311,ERIC,Go away.
162896,L149295,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,"Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?"
162897,L149143,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,"You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all."
162898,L149142,u4693,m311,ERIC,"Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy."
162899,L149141,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,Glad to see you're finally with the program.

162902,L149111,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,"Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion."
162903,L149110,u4693,m311,ERIC,Yes.
162904,L149109,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,Miss her?
162905,L149108,u4693,m311,ERIC,Shelly?
162906,L149107,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
162907,L149034,u4699,m311,SKULL COWBOY,Interested?  Follow the crow.
162908,L149033,u4693,m311,ERIC,What the hell are you?
162909,L149079,u4700,m311,T-BIRD,"Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile."

162911,L149077,u4700,m311,T-BIRD,Leather purse...
162912,L149076,u4695,m311,GIDEON,"Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,"
162913,L149075,u4700,m311,T-BIRD,...necklace... pearls...
162914,L149074,u4695,m311,GIDEON,18k.  Crap.
162915,L149073,u4700,m311,T-BIRD,Coupla more rings... 24k.
162916,L149071,u4700,m311,T-BIRD,"Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business."
162917,L149070,u4695,m311,GIDEON,"Blow yourself, bigmouth."
162918,L149506,u4696,m311,GRANGE,"Move in, guys."
162919,L149505,u4697,m311,LAO,No shooting.
162920,L149504,u4696,m311,GRANGE,I've got him if you want him.
162921,L149494,u4697,m311,LAO,Is he inside?
162922,L149493,u4696,m311,GRANGE,We've got company.
162923,L149453,u4696,m311,GRANGE,Kill a dead guy?
162924,L149452,u4697,m311,LAO,"Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me."
162925,L149450,u4696,m311,GRANGE,Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
162926,L149449,u4697,m311,LAO,Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
162927,L149448,u4696,m311,GRANGE,Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
162928,L149447,u4697,m311,LAO,"Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course."
162929,L149446,u4696,m311,GRANGE,"Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet."
162930,L149445,u4697,m311,LAO,"I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury."
162931,L149444,u4696,m311,GRANGE,Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
162932,L149443,u4697,m311,LAO,"Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow."
162933,L149442,u4696,m311,GRANGE,That thing is poisonous.
162934,L149441,u4697,m311,LAO,"This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real."
162935,L149440,u4696,m311,GRANGE,What... the hell is that?
162936,L149327,u4696,m311,GRANGE,"No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood."
162937,L149326,u4697,m311,LAO,Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
162938,L149389,u4697,m311,LAO,"Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table."
162939,L149388,u4702,m311,TOP DOLLAR,Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
162940,L149387,u4697,m311,LAO,"Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time."
162941,L149382,u4702,m311,TOP DOLLAR,The night is young.
162942,L149381,u4697,m311,LAO,"Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet."
162943,L149380,u4702,m311,TOP DOLLAR,"""Our"" Crow...?"
162944,L149379,u4697,m311,LAO,"Sounds like our ""Crow"" is out-maneuvering you."
162945,L149226,u4697,m311,LAO,To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
162946,L149225,u4702,m311,TOP DOLLAR,Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
162947,L149224,u4697,m311,LAO,"I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?"
162948,L149223,u4702,m311,TOP DOLLAR,I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
162949,L149222,u4697,m311,LAO,"I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The ""hit""."
162950,L149221,u4702,m311,TOP DOLLAR,One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
162951,L149220,u4697,m311,LAO,Who got himself what?
162952,L149219,u4702,m311,TOP DOLLAR,"Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked."
162953,L149218,u4697,m311,LAO,An unexpected pleasure.
162954,L150516,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I know.
162955,L150515,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
162956,L150514,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?"
162957,L150513,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,You didn't show it to anybody?
162958,L150512,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there."
162959,L150511,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,You what?
162960,L150510,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I have his journal.
162961,L150509,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
162962,L150508,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian."
162963,L150507,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect."
162964,L150506,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You heard me.
162965,L150505,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Excuse me?
162966,L150504,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Oh cut the shit, Kathryn."
162967,L150503,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -"
162968,L150502,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Thank you.
162969,L150501,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine."
162970,L150500,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I'll be fine.
162971,L150499,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Are you okay?
162972,L150498,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'm sure you're going to love it there.
162973,L150497,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,That's right.
162974,L150496,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
162975,L150495,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You might say that.
162976,L150494,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Did you know Sebastian well?
162977,L150493,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I don't think so.
162978,L150492,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Have we met?
162979,L150491,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Annette Harrison.
162980,L150490,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'm Kathryn.
162981,L149942,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Okay...
162982,L149941,u4709,m312,GREG,On my mother's life.
162983,L149940,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You promise not to say anything?
162984,L149939,u4709,m312,GREG,Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
162985,L149938,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Forever.
162986,L149937,u4709,m312,GREG,"Annette, how long have we known each other?"
162987,L149936,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
162988,L149935,u4709,m312,GREG,From who?
162989,L149934,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
162990,L149933,u4709,m312,GREG,"Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded."
162991,L149932,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,What do you mean?
162992,L149931,u4709,m312,GREG,"Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit."
162993,L149930,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
162994,L149929,u4709,m312,GREG,Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
162995,L149928,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Nothing.
162996,L149927,u4709,m312,GREG,That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
162997,L149926,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Really? I thought he said it all the time.
162998,L149925,u4709,m312,GREG,He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
162999,L150375,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"What, your virginity? Well that's over now."
163000,L150374,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,But you knew this was important to me.
163001,L150373,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive."
163002,L150372,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You don't know how to love.
163003,L150371,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
163004,L150370,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Why are you trying to hurt me?
163005,L150369,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up."
163006,L150368,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I love you.
163007,L150367,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Why aren't you understanding?
163008,L150366,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,What are you saying?
163009,L150365,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up."
163010,L150364,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Yeah, me neither."
163011,L150363,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,This isn't working out for me anymore.
163012,L150361,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Sure.
163013,L150360,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Would you like a tour?
163014,L150358,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Hi.
163015,L150357,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Hi.
163016,L150304,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It was perfect.
163017,L150303,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
163018,L150302,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Hi.
163019,L150301,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Hi.
163020,L150266,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Get off me.
163021,L150265,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Please don't go.
163022,L150264,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite."
163023,L150263,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,How am I a hypocrite?
163024,L150262,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites."
163025,L150261,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms."
163026,L150260,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Good for you.
163027,L150259,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I think that's for the best.
163028,L150258,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
163029,L150257,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Where are you going?
163030,L150256,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I just came to say goodbye.
163031,L150234,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
163032,L150233,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Yes.
163033,L150232,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You really want to know?
163034,L150231,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Why can't we be together?
163035,L150230,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,That's not fair.
163036,L150229,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus."
163037,L150228,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I have feelings for you.
163038,L150227,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
163039,L150226,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I thought you said we were going to be friends.
163040,L150225,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Because I'm in love with you.
163041,L150224,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Why are you doing this?
163042,L150223,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You know what? I don't take it back.
163043,L150219,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
163044,L150218,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
163045,L150217,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
163046,L150216,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Who's Monsieur Philipe?
163047,L150215,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
163048,L150212,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Not at all. Have a seat.
163049,L150211,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Am I bothering you?
163050,L150157,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,No?
163051,L150156,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,No.
163052,L150155,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Oh dear, are you actually laughing?"
163053,L150153,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Fine.
163054,L150152,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I am lighten. Can we drop this?
163055,L150151,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Lighten up.
163056,L150150,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I do not.
163057,L150149,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
163058,L150148,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I can't win with you.
163059,L150147,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me."
163060,L150146,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Yes it does.
163061,L150145,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
163062,L150144,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
163063,L150143,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
163064,L150142,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I don't.
163065,L150141,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You must take me for a real idiot.
163066,L150140,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I do.
163067,L150139,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"""I actually feel good about myself?"""
163068,L150138,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What?
163069,L150137,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Oh please.
163070,L150136,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
163071,L150118,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa."
163072,L150117,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Okay.
163073,L150116,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
163074,L150115,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
163075,L150114,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Need any company?
163076,L150113,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I'm doing some volunteer work.
163077,L150112,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Alone again.  What are you up to today?
163078,L150008,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I will.
163079,L150007,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Sure. Have a good night.
163080,L150005,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You're not gonna start that again.
163081,L150004,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation."
163082,L150003,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Somerset Maugham.
163083,L150002,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Of Human Bondage.
163084,L150001,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,What are you reading?
163085,L150000,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Reading.
163086,L149999,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,What are you doing?
163087,L149998,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Okay?
163088,L149997,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Wait, don't hang up."
163089,L149996,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go."
163090,L149995,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
163091,L149994,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,How was your date?
163092,L149993,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I'm... I'm alright.
163093,L149992,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing."
163094,L149991,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"No, not at all."
163095,L149924,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
163096,L149923,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
163097,L149922,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends."
163098,L149921,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What?
163099,L149920,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
163100,L149919,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Without question.
163101,L149918,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,And you promise to abide by it?
163102,L149917,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Yes.
163103,L149916,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You truly want to do something to make me happy?
163104,L149915,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind."
163105,L149914,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,That's also none of your business.
163106,L149913,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Doing what?
163107,L149912,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I'm busy.
163108,L149911,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,How about tonight?
163109,L149910,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,That's none of your business.
163110,L149909,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Who?
163111,L149908,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
163112,L149907,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
163113,L149906,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual."
163114,L149905,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Don't you believe in love at first sight?
163115,L149904,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You don't even know me.
163116,L149903,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
163117,L149902,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior."
163118,L149901,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away."
163119,L149900,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,And that's a bad thing?
163120,L149899,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the ""on"" button to ""off."" The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me."
163121,L149898,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
163122,L149897,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
163123,L149896,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,It was fine.
163124,L149895,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I said I was sorry.
163125,L149894,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
163126,L149893,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology."
163127,L149892,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Give it up.
163128,L149891,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,How are you today?
163129,L149890,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,No thank you.
163130,L149889,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Need a lift?
163131,L149861,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
163132,L149860,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,That's repulsive.
163133,L149859,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It's my house.
163134,L149858,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You're naked.
163135,L149857,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
163136,L149856,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"I'm sorry, but you're not my type."
163137,L149855,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles."
163138,L149854,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
163139,L149853,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
163140,L149852,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Because you act like a pig.
163141,L149851,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Why not?
163142,L149850,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work."
163143,L149849,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
163144,L149848,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Shut up.
163145,L149847,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend."
163146,L149846,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Thank you.
163147,L149845,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit."
163148,L149844,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time."
163149,L149843,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You implied it.
163150,L149842,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I never said that.
163151,L149841,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
163152,L149840,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,About what?
163153,L149839,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Refreshing.
163154,L149838,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,How's the water?
163155,L149837,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
163156,L149836,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
163157,L149835,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Give me the fucking letter.
163158,L149834,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I sincerely doubt it.
163159,L149833,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
163160,L149832,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
163161,L149831,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What? Another letter from your friend?
163162,L149830,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
163163,L149820,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Thank you.
163164,L149819,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
163165,L149818,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Please.
163166,L149817,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse."
163167,L149816,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
163168,L149815,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,At this hour? I don't think so.
163169,L149814,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
163170,L149813,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You need help.
163171,L149812,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,That's a matter of opinion.
163172,L149811,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Romantic? He rapes her.
163173,L149810,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature."
163174,L149809,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You've read The Fountainhead?
163175,L149808,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Great book.
163176,L149807,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,The Fountainhead.
163177,L149806,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What'cha reading?
163178,L149805,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read."
163179,L149804,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You talking to me?
163180,L149803,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Excuse me. Excuse me!
163181,L149727,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot."
163182,L149726,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me."
163183,L149725,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Why are you being so dramatic?
163184,L149724,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends."
163185,L149723,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,It's not really important.
163186,L149722,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?"
163187,L149721,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
163188,L149720,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
163189,L149719,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,A friend wrote me.
163190,L149718,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,How do you know I've been with several women?
163191,L149717,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
163192,L149716,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Oh really?
163193,L149715,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
163194,L149714,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
163195,L149713,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
163196,L149712,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I must say I found it rather appalling.
163197,L149711,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,You did?
163198,L149710,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I read your teen beat manifesto.
163199,L149709,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
163200,L149708,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
163201,L149706,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,No.
163202,L149705,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You a lesbo?
163203,L149704,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
163204,L149703,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Why not?
163205,L149702,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,No.
163206,L149701,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Got a boyfriend back home?
163207,L149700,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Junior.
163208,L149699,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,So what year are you going into?
163209,L149688,u4705,m312,AUNT HELEN,Doesn't ring a bell.
163210,L149687,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,German.
163211,L149686,u4705,m312,AUNT HELEN,Schwarz. Jewish?
163212,L149685,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,Ben Schwarz.
163213,L149684,u4705,m312,AUNT HELEN,I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
163214,L149683,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time."
163215,L149682,u4705,m312,AUNT HELEN,I'm sorry about that.
163216,L149681,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,"My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick."
163217,L149680,u4705,m312,AUNT HELEN,"Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?"
163218,L149679,u4704,m312,ANNETTE,It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
163219,L149885,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me."
163220,L149884,u4706,m312,BLAINE,I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
163221,L149762,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the ""stroke of midnight"" no pun intended?"
163222,L149761,u4706,m312,BLAINE,Don't think it's not going to cost you.
163223,L149760,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Outstanding.
163224,L149759,u4706,m312,BLAINE,Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
163225,L149758,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
163226,L149757,u4706,m312,BLAINE,Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
163227,L149756,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
163228,L149755,u4706,m312,BLAINE,"I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  ""What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything.""  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover."
163229,L149754,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Are you shitting me?
163230,L149753,u4706,m312,BLAINE,Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
163231,L149752,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What do you mean?
163232,L149751,u4706,m312,BLAINE,I don't think that bothered him.
163233,L149750,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
163234,L149749,u4706,m312,BLAINE,He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
163235,L149748,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,The football stud?
163236,L149747,u4706,m312,BLAINE,Greg McConnell.
163237,L149746,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
163238,L149745,u4706,m312,BLAINE,Where did you say she's from?
163239,L149744,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now."
163240,L149743,u4706,m312,BLAINE,Any ideas who it could be?
163241,L149742,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
163242,L149741,u4706,m312,BLAINE,- none taken -
163243,L149740,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -"
163244,L149965,u4716,m312,RONALD,Absolutely.
163245,L149964,u4707,m312,CECILE,I'll see you tomorrow.
163246,L149963,u4716,m312,RONALD,"Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway."
163247,L149738,u4707,m312,CECILE,Doctor King is my favorite.
163248,L149737,u4716,m312,RONALD,It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
163249,L149736,u4707,m312,CECILE,Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
163250,L149731,u4716,m312,RONALD,Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
163251,L149730,u4707,m312,CECILE,"Oh, I suck. I suck."
163252,L150103,u4707,m312,CECILE,Okay.
163253,L150102,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
163254,L150101,u4707,m312,CECILE,"I'm in the bath, mom."
163255,L150048,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,"Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now."
163256,L150047,u4707,m312,CECILE,Those are my letters!
163257,L150046,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
163258,L150045,u4707,m312,CECILE,Where did you find those?
163259,L149604,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,"Cecile, is that the best you can do?  You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before."
163260,L149603,u4707,m312,CECILE,What are the boys like?
163261,L150194,u4707,m312,CECILE,Cool.
163262,L150193,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,That's one way of looking at it.
163263,L150192,u4707,m312,CECILE,It's like a secret society.
163264,L150191,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it."
163265,L150190,u4707,m312,CECILE,But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
163266,L150189,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible."
163267,L150188,u4707,m312,CECILE,I don't love him. I love Ronald.
163268,L150187,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you."
163269,L150186,u4707,m312,CECILE,I am?
163270,L150185,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
163271,L150184,u4707,m312,CECILE,I did?
163272,L150183,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Cecile, you had an orgasm."
163273,L150182,u4707,m312,CECILE,"Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one."
163274,L150181,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Well did you like it?
163275,L150180,u4707,m312,CECILE,What do I do then?
163276,L150179,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did."
163277,L150178,u4707,m312,CECILE,If that's what you call it.
163278,L150177,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Well what then?
163279,L150176,u4707,m312,CECILE,No.
163280,L150175,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,He made you give him a blow job.
163281,L150174,u4707,m312,CECILE,Well... not exactly.
163282,L150173,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you."
163283,L150172,u4707,m312,CECILE,I don't know.
163284,L150171,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Why didn't you do something?
163285,L150170,u4707,m312,CECILE,"If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night."
163286,L150169,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Does your mother know?
163287,L150168,u4707,m312,CECILE,It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
163288,L150167,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Cecile, you have to tell me."
163289,L150166,u4707,m312,CECILE,I... I don't think you want to know.
163290,L150165,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,What do you mean?!
163291,L150164,u4707,m312,CECILE,Something awful happened last night.
163292,L150163,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
163293,L150161,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,It's Kathryn.
163294,L150160,u4707,m312,CECILE,Who is it?
163295,L149802,u4707,m312,CECILE,Best friends.
163296,L149801,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Of course I would. We're friends, right?"
163297,L149800,u4707,m312,CECILE,You'd do that for me?
163298,L149799,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house."
163299,L149798,u4707,m312,CECILE,Why?
163300,L149797,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
163301,L149796,u4707,m312,CECILE,Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
163302,L149795,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Did you hide the letters?
163303,L149794,u4707,m312,CECILE,Okay.
163304,L149793,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
163305,L149792,u4707,m312,CECILE,I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
163306,L149791,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me."
163307,L149790,u4707,m312,CECILE,I don't know.
163308,L149789,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Well do you like him?
163309,L149788,u4707,m312,CECILE,No.
163310,L149787,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,That's so romantic. Have you responded?
163311,L149786,u4707,m312,CECILE,Is it that obvious?
163312,L149785,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
163313,L149784,u4707,m312,CECILE,What are you saying?
163314,L149783,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
163315,L149782,u4707,m312,CECILE,That was cool.
163316,L149781,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Eyes closed.
163317,L149780,u4707,m312,CECILE,Okay.
163318,L149779,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is."
163319,L149778,u4707,m312,CECILE,It was nothing.
163320,L149777,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,See that wasn't so bad.
163321,L149776,u4707,m312,CECILE,I guess. It still sounds gross.
163322,L149775,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Do you want to learn or not?
163323,L149774,u4707,m312,CECILE,Are you for real?
163324,L149773,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
163325,L149772,u4707,m312,CECILE,Eww. No. That's gross.
163326,L149771,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
163327,L149770,u4707,m312,CECILE,Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
163328,L149769,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,What are you scared of?
163329,L149768,u4707,m312,CECILE,You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
163330,L149767,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,That's great.
163331,L149766,u4707,m312,CECILE,"What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend."
163332,L149765,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Really? Bulimic headcase.
163333,L149764,u4707,m312,CECILE,He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
163334,L149763,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice."
163335,L149620,u4707,m312,CECILE,Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
163336,L149619,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
163337,L149598,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
163338,L149597,u4707,m312,CECILE,What was that?
163339,L150254,u4707,m312,CECILE,Prude.
163340,L150253,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Good night Cecile.
163341,L150252,u4707,m312,CECILE,Want a blow job?
163342,L150251,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,No.
163343,L150250,u4707,m312,CECILE,Need any company?
163344,L150249,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'm taking a shower.
163345,L150248,u4707,m312,CECILE,Where are you going?
163346,L150245,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"No, you were fine."
163347,L150244,u4707,m312,CECILE,Is it me?
163348,L150243,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You think?
163349,L150242,u4707,m312,CECILE,I'm sorry.
163350,L150241,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
163351,L150240,u4707,m312,CECILE,I like it better when I'm on top.
163352,L150239,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"For the first time, yes. It'll pass."
163353,L150238,u4707,m312,CECILE,Am I suppose to be this sore?
163354,L150237,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Some other time, Cecile."
163355,L150236,u4707,m312,CECILE,Want to join me?
163356,L150099,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
163357,L150098,u4707,m312,CECILE,But -
163358,L150097,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You promised to let me kiss you.
163359,L150096,u4707,m312,CECILE,What are you doing?
163360,L150095,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I swear.
163361,L150094,u4707,m312,CECILE,"Just a kiss, right?"
163362,L150093,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Of course. I'm not a monster.
163363,L150092,u4707,m312,CECILE,And then I can go home?
163364,L150091,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss."
163365,L150090,u4707,m312,CECILE,Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
163366,L150089,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway."
163367,L150088,u4707,m312,CECILE,My mom? Don't call my mom.
163368,L150087,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up."
163369,L150086,u4707,m312,CECILE,I want to go home.
163370,L150085,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I was just kidding.
163371,L150084,u4707,m312,CECILE,I want to go home.
163372,L150083,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'm sorry that was out of line.
163373,L150081,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off."
163374,L150080,u4707,m312,CECILE,I look terrible.
163375,L150079,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Just taking your photo.
163376,L150078,u4707,m312,CECILE,What are you doing?
163377,L150077,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,He'll love it.
163378,L150076,u4707,m312,CECILE,You think he'll like it?
163379,L150075,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Excellent.
163380,L149617,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself."
163381,L149616,u4707,m312,CECILE,But I thought high school is only four years.
163382,L149615,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
163383,L149614,u4707,m312,CECILE,What year are you in?
163384,L149611,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
163385,L149610,u4707,m312,CECILE,My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
163386,L149580,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,Would you please leave.
163387,L149579,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"What, nervous I'm going to win?"
163388,L149578,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,"Good luck, Sebastian."
163389,L149577,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Really? Care to make a wager on that?
163390,L149576,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,"Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s."
163391,L149575,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Yummy.
163392,L149574,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,"My daughter, Rachel."
163393,L149573,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Well, you don't have to get nasty about it."
163394,L149572,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
163395,L149571,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You do?
163396,L149570,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,No it doesn't. I see right through you.
163397,L149569,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It works a little.
163398,L149568,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,"You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian."
163399,L149567,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help."
163400,L149566,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
163401,L149565,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer."
163402,L149564,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,No. This is going to be our last session.
163403,L149563,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Same time next week?
163404,L149562,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,I think that's all the time we have for today.
163405,L149561,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to ""save me."" The trick is to let them think it's true."
163406,L149560,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,Don't you want to change that?
163407,L149559,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I do.
163408,L149558,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,But you said you have the worst reputation.
163409,L149555,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I know.
163410,L149554,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
163411,L149553,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I know.
163412,L149552,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
163413,L149592,u4715,m312,RACHEL,I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
163414,L149591,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,"Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?"
163415,L149590,u4715,m312,RACHEL,"Nudie pictures, what do you think?"
163416,L149587,u4715,m312,RACHEL,"Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet."
163417,L149586,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,"Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle."
163418,L149585,u4715,m312,RACHEL,You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
163419,L149584,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,Who told you?
163420,L149583,u4715,m312,RACHEL,He told me he loved me and I believed him.
163421,L149582,u4708,m312,DR. GREENBAUM,"Honey, is something wrong?"
163422,L149581,u4715,m312,RACHEL,"Hi, mom."
163423,L150299,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
163424,L150298,u4709,m312,GREG,Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
163425,L150297,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,One.
163426,L150296,u4709,m312,GREG,I told you I don't know.
163427,L150295,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is."
163428,L150294,u4709,m312,GREG,I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
163429,L150293,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Where is she?!
163430,L150292,u4709,m312,GREG,No.
163431,L150291,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?"
163432,L150290,u4709,m312,GREG,Who is this?
163433,L150289,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Is she with you?
163434,L149955,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'll be in touch.
163435,L149954,u4709,m312,GREG,She bought it.
163436,L149953,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Pretty sure or sure sure?
163437,L149952,u4709,m312,GREG,I'm pretty sure she did.
163438,L149951,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,And you think she bought it?
163439,L149950,u4709,m312,GREG,Yes!
163440,L149949,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
163441,L149948,u4709,m312,GREG,Yes!
163442,L149947,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You told her I never said I love you before?
163443,L149946,u4709,m312,GREG,Yes.
163444,L149945,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Did you do everything I asked you to?
163445,L149944,u4709,m312,GREG,Positive.
163446,L149883,u4709,m312,GREG,"I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you."
163447,L149882,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
163448,L149881,u4709,m312,GREG,Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
163449,L149877,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
163450,L149876,u4709,m312,GREG,Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
163451,L149875,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
163452,L149872,u4709,m312,GREG,I told you to lock the door.
163453,L149871,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Whoa!
163454,L149870,u4709,m312,GREG,Get out of here.
163455,L149869,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Greg, is that you under the covers?"
163456,L149868,u4709,m312,GREG,Jesus!
163457,L149867,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit."
163458,L149865,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Baby?  Right on time.
163459,L149864,u4709,m312,GREG,Oh baby... oh baby...
163460,L150456,u4716,m312,RONALD,Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
163461,L150455,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
163462,L150454,u4716,m312,RONALD,He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
163463,L150453,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
163464,L150452,u4716,m312,RONALD,Racist piece of shit.
163465,L150451,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
163466,L150450,u4716,m312,RONALD,And this happened before you and I hooked up?
163467,L150449,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said ""Well what about Ronald,"" he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got..."
163468,L150443,u4716,m312,RONALD,I'll be right there.
163469,L150442,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over."
163470,L150441,u4716,m312,RONALD,What do you mean?
163471,L150440,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
163472,L150439,u4716,m312,RONALD,What's wrong?
163473,L150438,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,No.
163474,L150437,u4716,m312,RONALD,Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
163475,L150436,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,It's Kathryn.
163476,L150435,u4716,m312,RONALD,Yeah?
163477,L150434,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Ronald?
163478,L150433,u4716,m312,RONALD,Hello.
163479,L150059,u4716,m312,RONALD,"But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address."
163480,L150058,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,What do you do? Tell her you love her.
163481,L149735,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Likewise I'm sure.
163482,L149734,u4716,m312,RONALD,Pleased to meet you.
163483,L150414,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,War it is.
163484,L150413,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I think you have your answer.
163485,L150412,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
163486,L150411,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,And if I don't?
163487,L150410,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
163488,L150409,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Get out!
163489,L150408,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy."
163490,L150407,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Didn't you hear what I said?
163491,L150406,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Get out? We had an arrangement.
163492,L150405,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I accept. Now get out.
163493,L150404,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
163494,L150403,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Fine! Get off me!
163495,L150402,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Will you calm down?
163496,L150401,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Get off me!
163497,L150399,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers."
163498,L150398,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"In any event, you still owe me my reward."
163499,L150397,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers."
163500,L150396,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Come again?
163501,L150395,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
163502,L150394,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette."
163503,L150393,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"To my triumph, of course."
163504,L150392,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Thank you. Now, where were we?"
163505,L150391,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Well done.
163506,L150389,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Not that it's any of your business but yes.
163507,L150388,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Ronald?
163508,L150387,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company."
163509,L150386,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I thought we should celebrate.
163510,L150385,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Well done.
163511,L150384,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
163512,L150383,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Annette?
163513,L150382,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You wanted an answer to your question.
163514,L150381,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
163515,L150380,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I have a flair for drama.
163516,L150379,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"A little melodramatic, don't you think."
163517,L150353,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, ""How do you breathe when she sits on your face?"" ""It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her."" Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. ""I'm completely fucked up."" ""I'm completely fucked up."" ""I'm completely fucked up.""  Poor fatty never had a chance."
163518,L150352,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Screening calls. Any suggestions?
163519,L150351,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,How have you dumped girls in the past?
163520,L150350,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I've never done this before.
163521,L150349,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Why so nervous?
163522,L150348,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away."
163523,L150347,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
163524,L150346,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Is that what you think?
163525,L150345,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
163526,L150344,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
163527,L150343,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you."
163528,L150342,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"At first it was, but now it's become something bigger."
163529,L150341,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest."
163530,L150340,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
163531,L150339,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
163532,L150338,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"P-whipped, p-whipped."
163533,L150337,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"No, I'm not."
163534,L150336,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
163535,L150334,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,And I don't.
163536,L150333,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I want to fuck.
163537,L150332,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It clearly is why.
163538,L150331,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,And that's why you're leaving?
163539,L150330,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'm not in the mood.
163540,L150329,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Excuse me?
163541,L150328,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Some other time.
163542,L150326,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Mock, mock, mock."
163543,L150325,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping."
163544,L150324,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
163545,L150323,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"No, tell me."
163546,L150322,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card."
163547,L150321,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Oh come on. For her first time?
163548,L150320,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It was... Fantastic.
163549,L150319,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Tell me all the details.
163550,L150318,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Oh yes.
163551,L150317,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,You didn't?
163552,L150312,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in."
163553,L150311,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Kind of.
163554,L150310,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Bad time?
163555,L150286,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again."
163556,L150285,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Where'd she go?
163557,L150284,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
163558,L150283,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Where is she?
163559,L150282,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her."
163560,L150281,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified."
163561,L150280,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
163562,L150279,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it."
163563,L150278,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,So what went wrong?
163564,L150277,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Exactly the opposite.
163565,L150276,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,She shot you down.
163566,L150275,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
163567,L150274,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
163568,L150273,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,With who?
163569,L150272,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,So? How'd it go last night?
163570,L150271,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Morning.
163571,L150270,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Morning!
163572,L150210,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do."
163573,L150209,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
163574,L150208,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
163575,L150207,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,And that's why you're losing your bet?
163576,L150206,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh."
163577,L150205,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"She's really getting to you, isn't she?"
163578,L150204,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Nothing.
163579,L150203,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,What's your problem?
163580,L150202,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Shut up.
163581,L150201,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book."
163582,L150200,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Yeah.
163583,L150199,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,That her?
163584,L150198,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Take a look for yourself.
163585,L150197,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Who are you spying on?
163586,L150196,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Yippy.
163587,L150195,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
163588,L150072,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a ""laaaady."" Do you think I take great delight when I hear - ""Kathryn is so wonderful."" ""Kathryn is a model child."" ""Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day.""  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?"
163589,L150071,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You amaze me.
163590,L150070,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience."
163591,L150069,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that."
163592,L150068,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'm aware.
163593,L150067,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause."
163594,L150066,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Cecile.
163595,L150065,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Who are you calling?
163596,L149989,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Well, let me know when you do. Until then."
163597,L149988,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Any day now.
163598,L149987,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Have you succeeded in your task?
163599,L149986,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Moving along quite well.
163600,L149984,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I hate it too.
163601,L149983,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
163602,L149982,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Oh sis. You're so tense.
163603,L149981,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good."
163604,L149980,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'm at your service.
163605,L149978,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,But who will they turn to for help?
163606,L149977,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
163607,L149976,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What's your plan of attack?
163608,L149975,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder."
163609,L149974,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that."
163610,L149973,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
163611,L149972,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
163612,L149971,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,No.
163613,L149970,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
163614,L149969,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Interesting.
163615,L149968,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
163616,L149967,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,What's wrong with you?
163617,L149959,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Shhh.
163618,L149958,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You would not believe what--
163619,L149826,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Okay.
163620,L149825,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Call me later.
163621,L149824,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Blow me.
163622,L149823,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Loser.
163623,L149822,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I'm working on it.
163624,L149821,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Fuck her yet?
163625,L149678,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,It would feel so yummy.
163626,L149677,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Even there?
163627,L149676,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,You can put it anywhere.
163628,L149674,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
163629,L149673,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
163630,L149672,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
163631,L149671,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Be more specific.
163632,L149670,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
163633,L149669,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,And if I win?
163634,L149668,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine."
163635,L149667,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What are the terms?
163636,L149665,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Could you be more desperate to read it?
163637,L149664,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?"
163638,L149663,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art."
163639,L149662,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'll think about it...
163640,L149661,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Care to make a wager on that?
163641,L149660,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
163642,L149659,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
163643,L149658,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
163644,L149657,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
163645,L149656,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Jesus Christ, is she for real?"
163646,L149655,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Shut up and turn to page 64.
163647,L149654,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
163648,L149653,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
163649,L149652,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
163650,L149651,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. ""But I thought high school was only four years."" I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold."
163651,L149650,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Why not?
163652,L149648,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie."
163653,L149647,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Sounds intriguing.
163654,L149646,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
163655,L149645,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I see your point... though why should I care?
163656,L149644,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
163657,L149643,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
163658,L149642,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered."
163659,L149641,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
163660,L149640,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"I don't find this very funny,"
163661,L149638,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You don't mean?
163662,L149637,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent."
163663,L149636,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Sorry.
163664,L149629,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What?
163665,L149628,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you."
163666,L149626,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid."
163667,L149625,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
163668,L149624,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
163669,L149623,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
163670,L149613,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Outstanding.
163671,L149612,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
163672,L150038,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,It's the least I can do.
163673,L150037,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Oh please. I can't have you do that.
163674,L150036,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Let me get that for you.
163675,L150033,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Absolutely.
163676,L150032,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,You will be discreet about this?
163677,L150031,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,I can't thank you enough.
163678,L150029,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Black.
163679,L150028,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I know. She's so young and he's so -
163680,L150027,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Ronald? That's crazy.
163681,L150026,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
163682,L150025,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,"Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?"
163683,L150024,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
163684,L150023,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,What about her?
163685,L150022,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,It's Cecile.
163686,L150021,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Not at all. What's wrong?
163687,L150020,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I hope I didn't keep you from something.
163688,L150019,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,I got your message and came as quick as I could.
163689,L149606,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
163690,L149605,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples."
163691,L149602,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,That's beautiful.
163692,L149601,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,"I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works."
163693,L149600,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
163694,L149599,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,You're too kind.
163695,L149596,u4710,m312,KATHRYN,I'll do my best.
163696,L149595,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
163697,L150053,u4716,m312,RONALD,I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
163698,L150052,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
163699,L150051,u4716,m312,RONALD,"First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines."
163700,L150050,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
163701,L150049,u4716,m312,RONALD,Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
163702,L150044,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Is that so?
163703,L150043,u4716,m312,RONALD,Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
163704,L150042,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
163705,L150041,u4716,m312,RONALD,Excuse me.
163706,L150040,u4711,m312,MRS. CALDWELL,Who the hell do you think you are?!
163707,L150432,u4712,m312,MRS. O'SHEA,I understand. Good night.
163708,L150431,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It's really important.
163709,L150430,u4712,m312,MRS. O'SHEA,I'll do that.
163710,L150429,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
163711,L150428,u4712,m312,MRS. O'SHEA,"Young man, I already told you she's not here."
163712,L150427,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Annette! Annette!
163713,L150426,u4712,m312,MRS. O'SHEA,"Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -"
163714,L150425,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Do you know when she'll be back?
163715,L150424,u4712,m312,MRS. O'SHEA,She's out.
163716,L150423,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Do you know where she is?
163717,L150422,u4712,m312,MRS. O'SHEA,She's not here.
163718,L150421,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I need to talk to Annette.
163719,L150420,u4712,m312,MRS. O'SHEA,What do you want?
163720,L150418,u4712,m312,MRS. O'SHEA,I'll do that.
163721,L150417,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Well please leave a message that I called.
163722,L150416,u4712,m312,MRS. O'SHEA,"I've already told you, she's not home."
163723,L150415,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,It's desperate that I talk to her.
163724,L150356,u4712,m312,MRS. O'SHEA,You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
163725,L150355,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Hi. Is Annette at home?
163726,L150132,u4713,m312,MRS. SUGERMAN,Oh... no thank you...
163727,L150131,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"I said, do you want some water?"
163728,L150130,u4713,m312,MRS. SUGERMAN,Excuse me?
163729,L150129,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
163730,L150128,u4713,m312,MRS. SUGERMAN,I did?
163731,L150127,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Uh huh. You beat me three times.
163732,L150126,u4713,m312,MRS. SUGERMAN,We played backgammon?
163733,L150125,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Right after we played backgammon.
163734,L150124,u4713,m312,MRS. SUGERMAN,I did?
163735,L150123,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Yes, you already did."
163736,L150122,u4713,m312,MRS. SUGERMAN,Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
163737,L150465,u4714,m312,NIGHT DOORMAN,Don't worry about it.
163738,L150464,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
163739,L150463,u4714,m312,NIGHT DOORMAN,"I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day."
163740,L150462,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Do you mind if I check upstairs?
163741,L150461,u4714,m312,NIGHT DOORMAN,Nope.
163742,L150460,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Did she show up?
163743,L150459,u4714,m312,NIGHT DOORMAN,Eight o'clock. You got to go.
163744,L150458,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What time is it?
163745,L150478,u4716,m312,RONALD,You bastard!
163746,L150477,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Ronald, I'm sorry."
163747,L150476,u4716,m312,RONALD,Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
163748,L150475,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about."
163749,L150474,u4716,m312,RONALD,Did you hit her?
163750,L150473,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?"
163751,L150472,u4716,m312,RONALD,Kathryn. Did you hit her?
163752,L150471,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,What are you talking about?
163753,L150470,u4716,m312,RONALD,Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
163754,L150469,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
163755,L150468,u4716,m312,RONALD,It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
163756,L150467,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,Hey Ronald.
163757,L150061,u4716,m312,RONALD,How will I get to her?
163758,L150060,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,"Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter."
163759,L150057,u4716,m312,RONALD,She really loves me.
163760,L150056,u4717,m312,SEBASTIAN,You're a lucky guy.
163761,L150055,u4716,m312,RONALD,Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
163762,L151064,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves."
163763,L151063,u4718,m313,ALICE,How?
163764,L151062,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born."
163765,L151056,u4718,m313,ALICE,I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
163766,L151055,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,What do you mean?
163767,L151054,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this."
163768,L151024,u4718,m313,ALICE,"It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year  St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances."
163769,L151023,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
163770,L151022,u4718,m313,ALICE,I love the smell of pine.
163771,L150973,u4718,m313,ALICE,No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
163772,L150972,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,Does she go up to the Farren's often?
163773,L150784,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"But quite harmless, I'm sure."
163774,L150783,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand."
163775,L150782,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
163776,L150769,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday  about Oliver's first marriage  and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy  although he'll never realize it."
163777,L150768,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
163778,L150767,u4718,m313,ALICE,"We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist."
163779,L150766,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"But you don't keep a cat, do you?"
163780,L150765,u4718,m313,ALICE,"But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art."
163781,L150761,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,I know how it is.  My Dad collects miniature canon.
163782,L150760,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Oliver's pet,  I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire."
163783,L150756,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
163784,L150755,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Oh, hello."
163785,L150556,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,I'd love to.
163786,L150555,u4718,m313,ALICE,I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
163787,L150524,u4718,m313,ALICE,"That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan."
163788,L150523,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --"
163789,L150971,u4718,m313,ALICE,"All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you."
163790,L150970,u4719,m313,AMY,But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
163791,L150969,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?"
163792,L150968,u4719,m313,AMY,"Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?"
163793,L150913,u4719,m313,AMY,You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
163794,L150912,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Oh, thank you, darling."
163795,L150858,u4719,m313,AMY,"All right, mommy."
163796,L150857,u4718,m313,ALICE,Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
163797,L150856,u4719,m313,AMY,Irena.
163798,L150855,u4718,m313,ALICE,Irena.
163799,L150854,u4719,m313,AMY,What's her name?
163800,L150853,u4718,m313,ALICE,She was very pretty.
163801,L150852,u4719,m313,AMY,It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
163802,L150851,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Where'd you get this, darling?"
163803,L150847,u4719,m313,AMY,I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
163804,L150846,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy."
163805,L150739,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling."
163806,L150738,u4719,m313,AMY,But it's already come true.
163807,L150737,u4718,m313,ALICE,"You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true."
163808,L150736,u4719,m313,AMY,I got my wish anyway.
163809,L150735,u4718,m313,ALICE,Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
163810,L150734,u4718,m313,ALICE,"I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady."
163811,L150733,u4719,m313,AMY,Are they nice?
163812,L150732,u4718,m313,ALICE,"No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them."
163813,L150731,u4719,m313,AMY,Do you know the people?
163814,L150730,u4718,m313,ALICE,The Farren house
163815,L150729,u4719,m313,AMY,On the back street  a green house
163816,L150728,u4718,m313,ALICE,Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
163817,L150727,u4719,m313,AMY,At the old house with the voice.
163818,L150726,u4718,m313,ALICE,"But where did you get it, Amy?"
163819,L150725,u4719,m313,AMY,That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
163820,L150724,u4718,m313,ALICE,Where did you get this ring?
163821,L150723,u4719,m313,AMY,"I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would."
163822,L150722,u4718,m313,ALICE,Sometimes.
163823,L150721,u4719,m313,AMY,Did your wishes ever come true?
163824,L150720,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Oh, lots of times."
163825,L150719,u4719,m313,AMY,Did you ever make a wish?
163826,L150718,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Yes, darling."
163827,L150717,u4719,m313,AMY,Mommy --
163828,L150716,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Oh, you'll remember it some time."
163829,L150715,u4719,m313,AMY,"The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me."
163830,L150714,u4718,m313,ALICE,"What song, dear?"
163831,L150712,u4718,m313,ALICE,"I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough."
163832,L150711,u4719,m313,AMY,I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
163833,L150710,u4718,m313,ALICE,"What are saying, darling?"
163834,L150616,u4719,m313,AMY,I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --
163835,L150615,u4718,m313,ALICE,"But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter."
163836,L150613,u4719,m313,AMY,"You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl."
163837,L150612,u4718,m313,ALICE,You get your wish!
163838,L151035,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret."
163839,L151034,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling."
163840,L150896,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe."
163841,L150895,u4718,m313,ALICE,What's funny?
163842,L150864,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I suppose so.
163843,L150863,u4718,m313,ALICE,Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
163844,L150862,u4718,m313,ALICE,Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
163845,L150861,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Where did you get it?
163846,L150849,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Well, you know where it is."
163847,L150848,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I haven't had my breakfast.
163848,L150845,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
163849,L150844,u4718,m313,ALICE,It's your play.
163850,L150843,u4726,m313,OLIVER,What?
163851,L150842,u4718,m313,ALICE,Ollie.
163852,L150839,u4718,m313,ALICE,I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
163853,L150838,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"What is it, Alice?"
163854,L150691,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!"
163855,L150690,u4718,m313,ALICE,You're shouting at me.
163856,L150689,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I'm never unfair.
163857,L150688,u4718,m313,ALICE,You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
163858,L150687,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Well, it seemed to me --"
163859,L150686,u4718,m313,ALICE,Did you hear the child out?
163860,L150683,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Amy's been lying again.
163861,L150682,u4718,m313,ALICE,"My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?"
163862,L150588,u4718,m313,ALICE,"But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?"
163863,L150587,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
163864,L150586,u4718,m313,ALICE,What do you mean?
163865,L150585,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Something's haywire,"
163866,L150584,u4718,m313,ALICE,That's right.
163867,L150583,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I think I should.  3000W?
163868,L150582,u4718,m313,ALICE,"All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left."
163869,L150581,u4726,m313,OLIVER,No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
163870,L150580,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Oilie, that's for the children to play with."
163871,L150579,u4718,m313,ALICE,Times have changed.
163872,L150578,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,"
163873,L150577,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Yes, darling,"
163874,L150576,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?"
163875,L150575,u4718,m313,ALICE,It's early yet.
163876,L150574,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Where is everybody?
163877,L150573,u4718,m313,ALICE,I forgot I had it on.
163878,L150572,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
163879,L150552,u4718,m313,ALICE,"Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy."
163880,L150551,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"You make me sound like the father in ""East Lynne."""
163881,L150550,u4718,m313,ALICE,"I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today  let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?"
163882,L150549,u4726,m313,OLIVER,No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
163883,L150548,u4718,m313,ALICE,"That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy."
163884,L150547,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I know that.
163885,L150546,u4718,m313,ALICE,"I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver."
163886,L150545,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours."
163887,L150544,u4718,m313,ALICE,She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
163888,L150543,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I'd hate her to grow up like that.
163889,L150541,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child."
163890,L150540,u4718,m313,ALICE,I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
163891,L150539,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Well, it shows imagination, anyhow."
163892,L150781,u4718,m313,ALICE,"You do that, Edward."
163893,L150780,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"She said something about that, Mrs. Reed  but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there."
163894,L150779,u4718,m313,ALICE,But I told her to go with you.
163895,L150778,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there."
163896,L150777,u4718,m313,ALICE,That's the Farren house.
163897,L150776,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday."
163898,L150775,u4718,m313,ALICE,I thought you were with Amy.
163899,L150967,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you."
163900,L150966,u4719,m313,AMY,I got lots of presents.
163901,L150752,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
163902,L150751,u4719,m313,AMY,I live right here.
163903,L150750,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"No, darling, I hadn't intended to."
163904,L150749,u4719,m313,AMY,Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
163905,L150748,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"Hello, Amy."
163906,L150535,u4719,m313,AMY,"Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --"
163907,L150534,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present."
163908,L150533,u4719,m313,AMY,"It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party."
163909,L151150,u4719,m313,AMY,"Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?"
163910,L151149,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Yes, darling."
163911,L151148,u4719,m313,AMY,Daddy?
163912,L151138,u4719,m313,AMY,She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
163913,L151137,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"But there's no one here, darling."
163914,L151136,u4719,m313,AMY,"Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me."
163915,L151049,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?"
163916,L151048,u4719,m313,AMY,But...
163917,L151047,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there."
163918,L151046,u4719,m313,AMY,"But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree."
163919,L151045,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden."
163920,L151044,u4719,m313,AMY,"Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree."
163921,L151043,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Where, Amy? Where do you see her?"
163922,L151042,u4719,m313,AMY,"She's there, just like I said she'd be."
163923,L151038,u4719,m313,AMY,She's there whenever I call her!
163924,L151037,u4726,m313,OLIVER,In the garden? Would she be there now?
163925,L151036,u4719,m313,AMY,"It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!"
163926,L151033,u4719,m313,AMY,Because she is my friend.
163927,L151032,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?"
163928,L151030,u4719,m313,AMY,"Why, daddy, you know my friend too!"
163929,L151029,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Yes, Amy?"
163930,L151028,u4719,m313,AMY,Daddy!
163931,L150920,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?"
163932,L150919,u4719,m313,AMY,"She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too."
163933,L150918,u4726,m313,OLIVER,And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
163934,L150917,u4719,m313,AMY,Just you wait!
163935,L150911,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"This one says, ""To Mother from Amy."""
163936,L150910,u4719,m313,AMY,These are all from me.
163937,L150693,u4719,m313,AMY,You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
163938,L150692,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
163939,L150685,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Voices from an old dark house!
163940,L150684,u4719,m313,AMY,"No, I didn't."
163941,L150681,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Let me be the judge of that.
163942,L150680,u4719,m313,AMY,"Daddy, it's true."
163943,L150679,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing."
163944,L150678,u4719,m313,AMY,It was just a voice.
163945,L150677,u4726,m313,OLIVER,And who did the voice belong to?
163946,L150676,u4719,m313,AMY,It's true.
163947,L150675,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Now Amy
163948,L150674,u4719,m313,AMY,"I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---"
163949,L150673,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Why didn't you run after them?
163950,L150672,u4719,m313,AMY,They ran away.
163951,L150671,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
163952,L150670,u4719,m313,AMY,It was on account of the birthday party.
163953,L150669,u4726,m313,OLIVER,What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
163954,L150668,u4719,m313,AMY,"But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me."
163955,L150667,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Can't you tell me later?
163956,L150666,u4719,m313,AMY,"I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children."
163957,L150665,u4726,m313,OLIVER,What do you want. Amy?
163958,L150611,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"But this is different.  Go on blow,"
163959,L150610,u4719,m313,AMY,But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
163960,L150609,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Certain wishes do.
163961,L150608,u4719,m313,AMY,But wishes don't come true.
163962,L150607,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true."
163963,L150602,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox."
163964,L150601,u4719,m313,AMY,I didn't forget.
163965,L150600,u4726,m313,OLIVER,But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
163966,L150599,u4719,m313,AMY,"Yes, daddy."
163967,L150598,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Amy, not that old tree!"
163968,L150597,u4719,m313,AMY,I'll show you.
163969,L150596,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Where did you mail them?
163970,L150595,u4719,m313,AMY,"Yes, I did."
163971,L150594,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Did you mail then?
163972,L150593,u4719,m313,AMY,"Yes, daddy."
163973,L150592,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?"
163974,L150567,u4726,m313,OLIVER,You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
163975,L150566,u4719,m313,AMY,Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
163976,L150940,u4719,m313,AMY,"Well, I guess we're not a very proper family."
163977,L150939,u4723,m313,LOIS,We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
163978,L150938,u4719,m313,AMY,No.
163979,L150937,u4723,m313,LOIS,"My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?"
163980,L150936,u4719,m313,AMY,I don't know yet.
163981,L150935,u4723,m313,LOIS,What'd you get for Christmas?
163982,L151131,u4722,m313,IRENA,Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
163983,L151130,u4719,m313,AMY,But why?
163984,L151129,u4722,m313,IRENA,"Yes, Amy."
163985,L151128,u4719,m313,AMY,You?
163986,L151127,u4722,m313,IRENA,"But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead."
163987,L151126,u4719,m313,AMY,"Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible."
163988,L151125,u4722,m313,IRENA,"Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing."
163989,L151124,u4719,m313,AMY,But she's dead!
163990,L151123,u4722,m313,IRENA,You mustn't be afraid.
163991,L151122,u4719,m313,AMY,She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
163992,L151121,u4722,m313,IRENA,"Don't cry, Amy."
163993,L151120,u4719,m313,AMY,It's you...Irena...my friend!
163994,L150984,u4719,m313,AMY,I want to touch it.
163995,L150983,u4722,m313,IRENA,It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
163996,L150982,u4719,m313,AMY,May I pet the deer?
163997,L150981,u4722,m313,IRENA,It's a warm breath -- warm and strong  warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
163998,L150980,u4719,m313,AMY,I can sea its breath in the cold.
163999,L150979,u4722,m313,IRENA,Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
164000,L150978,u4719,m313,AMY,It stands so still.
164001,L150977,u4722,m313,IRENA,You wanted to share this moment with me.
164002,L150976,u4719,m313,AMY,"So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful."
164003,L150964,u4722,m313,IRENA,"A merry Christmas to you, Amy."
164004,L150963,u4719,m313,AMY,Merry Christmas.
164005,L150959,u4719,m313,AMY,"Oh, please!"
164006,L150958,u4722,m313,IRENA,You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
164007,L150957,u4719,m313,AMY,"Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us."
164008,L150956,u4722,m313,IRENA,I shall wear it in my hair!
164009,L150955,u4719,m313,AMY,"It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others."
164010,L150954,u4722,m313,IRENA,"Oh, how beautiful!"
164011,L150953,u4719,m313,AMY,"You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,"
164012,L150952,u4722,m313,IRENA,"Oh, thank you, Amy."
164013,L150951,u4719,m313,AMY,"Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present."
164014,L150908,u4722,m313,IRENA,"Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights."
164015,L150907,u4719,m313,AMY,"Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,"
164016,L150906,u4722,m313,IRENA,"All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold."
164017,L150905,u4719,m313,AMY,My dolls. We can pretend.
164018,L150904,u4722,m313,IRENA,Your children?
164019,L150903,u4719,m313,AMY,"No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children."
164020,L150901,u4722,m313,IRENA,"Pretend, darling.  It's All Soul's Eve.  Round about the fire we go...  Over the flames we leapt"
164021,L150900,u4719,m313,AMY,But we don't have any sea weed.
164022,L150899,u4722,m313,IRENA,"light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!"
164023,L150898,u4719,m313,AMY,That one's an elm.
164024,L150897,u4722,m313,IRENA,There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
164025,L150894,u4722,m313,IRENA,"Of course,"
164026,L150893,u4719,m313,AMY,This is more fun than just pretend.
164027,L150892,u4722,m313,IRENA,That's right!
164028,L150891,u4719,m313,AMY,"Yes, yes! I see Prince,"
164029,L150890,u4722,m313,IRENA,Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
164030,L150889,u4719,m313,AMY,A princess?
164031,L150888,u4722,m313,IRENA,Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
164032,L150887,u4719,m313,AMY,The numbers simply don't mean anything
164033,L150886,u4722,m313,IRENA,But you must!
164034,L150885,u4719,m313,AMY,I'll just never learn arithmetic.
164035,L150884,u4722,m313,IRENA,"Can't you get it, darling?"
164036,L150883,u4722,m313,IRENA,Whenever you want.
164037,L150882,u4719,m313,AMY,You'll always play with me?
164038,L150881,u4719,m313,AMY,"Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend."
164039,L150880,u4722,m313,IRENA,No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
164040,L150879,u4719,m313,AMY,Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
164041,L150878,u4722,m313,IRENA,"For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me"
164042,L150877,u4719,m313,AMY,I shall want you for always.
164043,L150876,u4722,m313,IRENA,For as long as you'll let me.
164044,L150875,u4719,m313,AMY,Will you be friend for always?
164045,L150874,u4722,m313,IRENA,I can not tell you.
164046,L150873,u4719,m313,AMY,But where is that?
164047,L150872,u4722,m313,IRENA,You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
164048,L150871,u4719,m313,AMY,But where do you come from?
164049,L150870,u4722,m313,IRENA,I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
164050,L150869,u4719,m313,AMY,I've wanted a friend.
164051,L150868,u4722,m313,IRENA,I'm your friend.
164052,L150867,u4719,m313,AMY,Irena. But who are you?
164053,L150866,u4722,m313,IRENA,You called me by my name.
164054,L150865,u4719,m313,AMY,Who are you?
164055,L151020,u4719,m313,AMY,But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
164056,L151019,u4721,m313,EDWARD,It got hit.
164057,L151018,u4719,m313,AMY,But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
164058,L151017,u4721,m313,EDWARD,Because it can't. It's dead.
164059,L151016,u4719,m313,AMY,Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
164060,L151015,u4721,m313,EDWARD,Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
164061,L151014,u4719,m313,AMY,But what happened to the little deer?
164062,L151013,u4721,m313,EDWARD,Bad luck to see death in the snow.
164063,L151012,u4719,m313,AMY,But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
164064,L151011,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look."
164065,L150986,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter."
164066,L150985,u4719,m313,AMY,There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
164067,L150830,u4721,m313,EDWARD,But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
164068,L150829,u4719,m313,AMY,But she's such a nice lady.
164069,L150828,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did."
164070,L150813,u4719,m313,AMY,But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
164071,L150812,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"About time for you to come home, Amy."
164072,L150747,u4719,m313,AMY,That means I can go alone?
164073,L150746,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today."
164074,L150745,u4719,m313,AMY,"You're going to be busy all day long, Edward."
164075,L150744,u4721,m313,EDWARD,Soon as I finish.
164076,L150743,u4719,m313,AMY,Will you come soon?
164077,L150742,u4721,m313,EDWARD,You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
164078,L150741,u4719,m313,AMY,But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
164079,L150740,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Little miss, you're stopping me in my work."
164080,L150708,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden."
164081,L150707,u4719,m313,AMY,I wasn't singing to myself.
164082,L150697,u4721,m313,EDWARD,Let me take another look at that ring.
164083,L150696,u4719,m313,AMY,I'm trying to.
164084,L150695,u4721,m313,EDWARD,Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
164085,L150658,u4721,m313,EDWARD,That's the clever way to do it.
164086,L150657,u4719,m313,AMY,"Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish."
164087,L150656,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye."
164088,L150655,u4719,m313,AMY,the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
164089,L150654,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish."
164090,L150653,u4719,m313,AMY,A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
164091,L150652,u4721,m313,EDWARD,I wouldn't be surprised if it were a true wishing ring.
164092,L150651,u4719,m313,AMY,It's a pretty ring.
164093,L150650,u4721,m313,EDWARD,Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
164094,L150649,u4719,m313,AMY,A lady threw it to me.
164095,L150648,u4721,m313,EDWARD,That's a fine-looking ring.
164096,L150647,u4719,m313,AMY,Look at my ring.
164097,L150559,u4719,m313,AMY,Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
164098,L150558,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too."
164099,L151116,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,I can't do it! I can't do it!
164100,L151115,u4719,m313,AMY,Hurry!
164101,L151114,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"Yes, yes -"
164102,L151113,u4719,m313,AMY,"Hurry, hurry."
164103,L151110,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
164104,L151109,u4719,m313,AMY,Hide me? Why?
164105,L151005,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood."
164106,L151004,u4719,m313,AMY,And does he kill people?
164107,L151002,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,Don't you read Shakespeare?
164108,L151001,u4719,m313,AMY,Who's Herne the Huntsman?
164109,L150998,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,Don't you hear it?
164110,L150997,u4719,m313,AMY,What?
164111,L150989,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
164112,L150988,u4719,m313,AMY,I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
164113,L150817,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,Good.
164114,L150816,u4719,m313,AMY,"He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay."
164115,L150809,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
164116,L150808,u4719,m313,AMY,Why hasn't he got a head?
164117,L150807,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,The Headless Horseman --
164118,L150804,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"Do you know the story of ""The Headless Horseman?"""
164119,L150803,u4719,m313,AMY,Mommy read it to ne.
164120,L150802,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
164121,L150801,u4719,m313,AMY,I like stories.
164122,L150799,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams."
164123,L150798,u4719,m313,AMY,"No, thank you."
164124,L150797,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?"
164125,L150796,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE>                                AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk."
164126,L150795,u4719,m313,AMY,Who is she?
164127,L150794,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!"
164128,L150792,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
164129,L150791,u4719,m313,AMY,But I only came to give back the ring.
164130,L150790,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days  those beautiful, shilling, golden days."
164131,L150789,u4719,m313,AMY,But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
164132,L150788,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
164133,L150787,u4719,m313,AMY,"If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you."
164134,L150786,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that."
164135,L151106,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,Good night...Barbara...
164136,L151105,u4720,m313,BARBARA,"Good night, mother, good night."
164137,L151104,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise."
164138,L151103,u4720,m313,BARBARA,"If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:"
164139,L151102,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no."
164140,L151101,u4720,m313,BARBARA,There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
164141,L151099,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget."
164142,L151098,u4720,m313,BARBARA,"Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me."
164143,L151096,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"Yes, Barbara... Barbara..."
164144,L151095,u4720,m313,BARBARA,Mother! You called me by name!
164145,L151092,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,It was pale...a shadowed gold.
164146,L151091,u4720,m313,BARBARA,And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
164147,L151090,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"Yes...yes, that's true."
164148,L151089,u4720,m313,BARBARA,And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
164149,L151088,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray."
164150,L151087,u4720,m313,BARBARA,"Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?"
164151,L151086,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,Anybody could know that song.
164152,L151085,u4720,m313,BARBARA,"Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?"
164153,L151076,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead."
164154,L151075,u4720,m313,BARBARA,But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
164155,L151074,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died."
164156,L151073,u4720,m313,BARBARA,I hate the storm. I hate it!
164157,L151010,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,My daughter died long ago.
164158,L151009,u4720,m313,BARBARA,You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
164159,L150834,u4720,m313,BARBARA,Look at me.
164160,L150833,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you."
164161,L151007,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry."
164162,L151006,u4721,m313,EDWARD,It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
164163,L151000,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,
164164,L150999,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"What is it, ma'am?"
164165,L150996,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,Wait a minute. Listen.
164166,L150995,u4721,m313,EDWARD,It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
164167,L150991,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,That's from her -- that woman.
164168,L150990,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am."
164169,L150822,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Come away, Amy."
164170,L150821,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking"
164171,L150820,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me."
164172,L150819,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,"On the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding."
164173,L150815,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Now, I don't know Amy --"
164174,L150814,u4725,m313,MRS. FARREN,Let the child stay.
164175,L150916,u4721,m313,EDWARD,Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
164176,L150915,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"""To Daddy from Amy."" Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, ""To Edward from Amy.""."
164177,L150706,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself."
164178,L150705,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward."
164179,L150704,u4721,m313,EDWARD,I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
164180,L150702,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"So do I, Mr. Reed."
164181,L150701,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I like to see her happy.
164182,L150700,u4721,m313,EDWARD,Amy looks happy  seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
164183,L150591,u4721,m313,EDWARD,She pleaded so to do it
164184,L150590,u4726,m313,OLIVER,And Amy mailed them?
164185,L150589,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post."
164186,L150569,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Go on -- out with you.
164187,L150568,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming."
164188,L150565,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean."
164189,L150564,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
164190,L150563,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
164191,L150562,u4721,m313,EDWARD,When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
164192,L150561,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"Yes, everything's all right, Edward."
164193,L150560,u4721,m313,EDWARD,"Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?"
164194,L151066,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
164195,L151065,u4726,m313,OLIVER,But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
164196,L151060,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind."
164197,L151059,u4726,m313,OLIVER,"But there was nothing, no one in the garden."
164198,L151058,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
164199,L151057,u4726,m313,OLIVER,She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
164200,L150554,u4726,m313,OLIVER,We'll see that she gets there in good time
164201,L150553,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
164202,L150529,u4726,m313,OLIVER,Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
164203,L150528,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,"Well, that seems a harmless fancy --"
164204,L150527,u4726,m313,OLIVER,No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
164205,L150526,u4724,m313,MISS CALLAHAN,Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
164206,L150525,u4726,m313,OLIVER,I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
164207,L151598,u4727,m314,CARLTON,Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
164208,L151597,u4730,m314,GEORGE,Jennifer gave her a make-over.
164209,L151596,u4727,m314,CARLTON,No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
164210,L151585,u4730,m314,GEORGE,Can we get some service here?
164211,L151584,u4727,m314,CARLTON,Waiter! She needs more water.
164212,L151192,u4727,m314,CARLTON,"Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome."
164213,L151191,u4730,m314,GEORGE,"My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere."
164214,L151190,u4727,m314,CARLTON,I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
164215,L151189,u4730,m314,GEORGE,I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
164216,L151188,u4727,m314,CARLTON,"What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life."
164217,L151187,u4730,m314,GEORGE,Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
164218,L151186,u4727,m314,CARLTON,That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
164219,L151185,u4730,m314,GEORGE,It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
164220,L151613,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Never felt better.
164221,L151612,u4727,m314,CARLTON,I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
164222,L151611,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I've been working out.
164223,L151610,u4727,m314,CARLTON,Wow your body's really hot.
164224,L151609,u4727,m314,CARLTON,Your lips look delicious.
164225,L151608,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What?
164226,L151606,u4727,m314,CARLTON,Yeah but they looked cool...
164227,L151605,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
164228,L151604,u4727,m314,CARLTON,"James Dean, Humphrey Bogart..."
164229,L151603,u4729,m314,FRIDA,No.
164230,L151602,u4727,m314,CARLTON,Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
164231,L151601,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
164232,L151600,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I've changed a lot lately.
164233,L151599,u4727,m314,CARLTON,Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
164234,L151577,u4727,m314,CARLTON,"Yeah that's like a three bagger. Today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses."
164235,L151576,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe ""coyote ugly"" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally ""ugly"" but is really beautiful."
164236,L151575,u4727,m314,CARLTON,"No one I've run into knows what ""coyote ugly"" means."
164237,L151573,u4727,m314,CARLTON,Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
164238,L151572,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving."
164239,L151571,u4727,m314,CARLTON,"Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?"
164240,L151471,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
164241,L151470,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Does she have PMS?
164242,L151469,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,"Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called ""The PMS Diet,"" which may be helpful."
164243,L151468,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I get crazy dreams and I black out.
164244,L151467,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
164245,L151466,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair."
164246,L151465,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,How have you been feeling?
164247,L151464,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Nearly four.
164248,L151463,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
164249,L151264,u4729,m314,FRIDA,It's not just in my head.
164250,L151263,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
164251,L151262,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What else is there?
164252,L151261,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,"That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol..."
164253,L151260,u4729,m314,FRIDA,It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
164254,L151259,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
164255,L151258,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Good. Except for PMS.
164256,L151257,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,How's the rest of your health?
164257,L151255,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, it was another woman."
164258,L151254,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,A dog at Victoria's Secret?
164259,L151253,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Oh, on my wrist."
164260,L151252,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,I mean where on your body?
164261,L151251,u4729,m314,FRIDA,There was a sale.
164262,L151250,u4729,m314,FRIDA,At Victoria's Secret.
164263,L151249,u4728,m314,DOCTOR,A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
164264,L151643,u4735,m314,MOTHER,"It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if..."
164265,L151642,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom."
164266,L151641,u4735,m314,MOTHER,"You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?"
164267,L151640,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What does that have to do with me?
164268,L151639,u4735,m314,MOTHER,"We're worried about you. ""60 Minutes"" was on same-sex couples."
164269,L151638,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Mom!
164270,L151637,u4735,m314,MOTHER,No it's mom.
164271,L151636,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Jennifer?
164272,L152038,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Sure. See ya.
164273,L152037,u4729,m314,FRIDA,God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
164274,L152036,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
164275,L152035,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
164276,L152034,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Frida? You okay?
164277,L152033,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Hello?
164278,L151977,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over."
164279,L151976,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
164280,L151975,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I wish I only had your problems.
164281,L151974,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
164282,L151973,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I thought you and George were getting married.
164283,L151972,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with."
164284,L151971,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Did I kill a guy named Benito?
164285,L151970,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,About Benito.
164286,L151969,u4729,m314,FRIDA,About Mark? Carlton?
164287,L151968,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I think George knows.
164288,L151967,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see ""American Werewolf in London?"""
164289,L151966,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,No. I won't let you do that.
164290,L151965,u4729,m314,FRIDA,No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
164291,L151964,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I guess you'll find out.
164292,L151963,u4729,m314,FRIDA,But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
164293,L151962,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
164294,L151961,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
164295,L151960,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
164296,L151959,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
164297,L151958,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
164298,L151957,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'm cleaning my stove.
164299,L151939,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I think I already have.
164300,L151938,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Fall in love.
164301,L151937,u4729,m314,FRIDA,So what do I do?
164302,L151936,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,What choice do we have?
164303,L151935,u4729,m314,FRIDA,So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
164304,L151934,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
164305,L151933,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Guess she never found true love.
164306,L151932,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
164307,L151931,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
164308,L151930,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"""The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves."" See I knew you never loved Mark."
164309,L151929,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
164310,L151928,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. ""The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."""
164311,L151926,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Check out what I found.
164312,L151925,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"""Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..."" Nothing about turning into a werewolf."
164313,L151895,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
164314,L151894,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf."
164315,L151893,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you."
164316,L151892,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Peter keeps asking me out.
164317,L151891,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells..."
164318,L151868,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this."
164319,L151867,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You're such a good friend.
164320,L151866,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
164321,L151865,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
164322,L151864,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Does that mean this whole thing is over?
164323,L151863,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I think I just got my period.
164324,L151856,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you."
164325,L151855,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Peter knows something.
164326,L151809,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Hide him.
164327,L151808,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What the fuck are we going to do?
164328,L151804,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Tell them you'll meet them outside.
164329,L151803,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in."
164330,L151802,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Ignore it.
164331,L151801,u4729,m314,FRIDA,No.
164332,L151800,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,You expecting someone?
164333,L151799,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You should have seen it erect.
164334,L151798,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
164335,L151791,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves."
164336,L151790,u4729,m314,FRIDA,That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
164337,L151789,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead."
164338,L151788,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I could smell another woman on him.
164339,L151787,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Why the fuck would you do that?
164340,L151786,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
164341,L151785,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control."
164342,L151784,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating."
164343,L151783,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
164344,L151782,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?"
164345,L151781,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
164346,L151780,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What? Why'd you do that?
164347,L151779,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night."
164348,L151778,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Why not? There's been a murder.
164349,L151777,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,DON'T call the police.
164350,L151776,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
164351,L151775,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,What happened to his tooth?
164352,L151768,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Yeah, I guess. Mark?"
164353,L151767,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,He's been here all night?
164354,L151766,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
164355,L151765,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Did you get rid of Mark?
164356,L151764,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Holy shit, I don't know."
164357,L151744,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
164358,L151743,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Okay, I gotta go."
164359,L151742,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Get rid of him!
164360,L151738,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
164361,L151737,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
164362,L151736,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,And he was missing an arm.
164363,L151735,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Oh no.
164364,L151734,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Frida, Carlton's dead."
164365,L151733,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Shit, I guess I missed work."
164366,L151732,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Tuesday. Are you okay?
164367,L151731,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I've been here. What day is it?
164368,L151730,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
164369,L151729,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Hello?
164370,L151670,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
164371,L151669,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?"
164372,L151668,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I haven't gotten it yet.
164373,L151667,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
164374,L151666,u4729,m314,FRIDA,It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
164375,L151665,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
164376,L151664,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts."
164377,L151663,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?"
164378,L151662,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!"
164379,L151661,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,And what makes you think you killed a man?
164380,L151660,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I put it down the garbage disposal.
164381,L151659,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,So where's this infamous arm now?
164382,L151634,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now."
164383,L151633,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
164384,L151632,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him."
164385,L151631,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
164386,L151630,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
164387,L151628,u4729,m314,FRIDA,There is a man's arm in my bed.
164388,L151627,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone."
164389,L151595,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
164390,L151594,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
164391,L151593,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
164392,L151592,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,No they're not.
164393,L151591,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!"
164394,L151590,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No you don't, believe me."
164395,L151589,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Geez, I wish I'd get it like that."
164396,L151588,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
164397,L151587,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
164398,L151581,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I still thought it was a purse.
164399,L151580,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word ""bag."" It used to be ""No, that's not my bag"" -- meaning not my thing. But now ""my bag"" means ""my fault."""
164400,L151579,u4729,m314,FRIDA,It is so hot in here.
164401,L151578,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Charming Carlton.
164402,L151570,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said ""Hey there beautiful."""
164403,L151569,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I think he called you beautiful.
164404,L151568,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What did he say?
164405,L151566,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You're just saying that.
164406,L151565,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great."
164407,L151564,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
164408,L151559,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
164409,L151558,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Okay. I guess so.
164410,L151557,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me."
164411,L151555,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us."
164412,L151554,u4729,m314,FRIDA,It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
164413,L151553,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone."
164414,L151552,u4729,m314,FRIDA,We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
164415,L151551,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,How'd it go with the cop?
164416,L151550,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I looked like an Italian man!
164417,L151549,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
164418,L151548,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
164419,L151527,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, ""I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?"" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out..."
164420,L151526,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What the hell is the tampon test?
164421,L151525,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Give him the tampon test.
164422,L151524,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
164423,L151523,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
164424,L151522,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
164425,L151436,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?"
164426,L151435,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
164427,L151434,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
164428,L151433,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over."
164429,L151432,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?"
164430,L151420,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
164431,L151419,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I wonder if he's married.
164432,L151418,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Rule one: always wear make-up.
164433,L151417,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up."
164434,L151416,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
164435,L151415,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already."
164436,L151414,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Are those Mark's?
164437,L151413,u4729,m314,FRIDA,My vision got worse again.
164438,L151412,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
164439,L151411,u4729,m314,FRIDA,And my bra finally fits again.
164440,L151410,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,At least your PMS is over.
164441,L151409,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
164442,L151408,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,And then?
164443,L151407,u4729,m314,FRIDA,He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
164444,L151406,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,What? Why the hell did he do that?
164445,L151405,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
164446,L151404,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
164447,L151403,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
164448,L151402,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
164449,L151401,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
164450,L151400,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
164451,L151399,u4729,m314,FRIDA,No. I don't think so.
164452,L151398,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"No, did you fuck him?"
164453,L151397,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Did I kill him? Of course not!
164454,L151396,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,So did you do it?
164455,L151395,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
164456,L151394,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Why would they exaggerate?
164457,L151393,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I'm sure they were exaggerating.
164458,L151392,u4729,m314,FRIDA,And he was ripped limb from limb?
164459,L151391,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"There you go, blaming yourself for everything again."
164460,L151390,u4729,m314,FRIDA,He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
164461,L151322,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them."
164462,L151321,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Hey, did you get contacts?"
164463,L151320,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal."
164464,L151319,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Holy shit, I'm a freak."
164465,L151318,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
164466,L151317,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
164467,L151316,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Where?
164468,L151314,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something."
164469,L151313,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
164470,L151312,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Are you kidding? He might as well say, ""Can I date rape you?"""
164471,L151311,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Maybe they have to pee.
164472,L151310,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. ""Can I use your phone?"" ""How about a nightcap?"" ""I want to meet your cat."" And my all-time favorite, the old standby, ""I have to use your bathroom."""
164473,L151309,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
164474,L151308,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark."
164475,L151307,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
164476,L151248,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away..."
164477,L151247,u4729,m314,FRIDA,George bit you?
164478,L151246,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
164479,L151245,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I think she broke the skin.
164480,L151244,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
164481,L151243,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,And she got the medium.
164482,L151242,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
164483,L151236,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Frida, grab that red one."
164484,L151235,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Where are all the mediums?
164485,L151230,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt."
164486,L151229,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I don't know.
164487,L151228,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
164488,L151227,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
164489,L151226,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret."
164490,L151207,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
164491,L151206,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Or if there's a full moon.
164492,L151201,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
164493,L151200,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye."
164494,L151199,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Can't you get contacts?
164495,L151198,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Only to see.
164496,L151197,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Do you really need these?
164497,L151196,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You're just saying that.
164498,L151195,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out."
164499,L151184,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'd kill for just a little bloated.
164500,L151183,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I get a little bloated sometimes.
164501,L151182,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
164502,L151181,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men."
164503,L151180,u4729,m314,FRIDA,My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
164504,L151179,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Maybe he's just shy.
164505,L151178,u4729,m314,FRIDA,He hasn't said one word to me.
164506,L151168,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,People notice you Frida.
164507,L151167,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
164508,L151164,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,So don't look in his eyes.
164509,L151163,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
164510,L151162,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
164511,L151161,u4729,m314,FRIDA,He's a very talented musician.
164512,L151160,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job."
164513,L151159,u4729,m314,FRIDA,My shrink says he's not so bad.
164514,L151158,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Anything's better than Mark.
164515,L151157,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Translation: a total geek.
164516,L151156,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
164517,L151155,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
164518,L151154,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade."
164519,L151153,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
164520,L151358,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?"
164521,L151357,u4731,m314,GREGORY,So pee? Here?
164522,L151356,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Uh huh. So pee.
164523,L151355,u4731,m314,GREGORY,"I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee."
164524,L151354,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
164525,L151353,u4731,m314,GREGORY,Yes I do have to pee!
164526,L151352,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You don't have to pee.
164527,L151351,u4731,m314,GREGORY,Knock what off?
164528,L151350,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Oh come on. Knock it off.
164529,L151349,u4731,m314,GREGORY,That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
164530,L151348,u4729,m314,FRIDA,My apartment's just such a mess.
164531,L151347,u4731,m314,GREGORY,I didn't have to pee then.
164532,L151346,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You should have gone at the restaurant.
164533,L151345,u4731,m314,GREGORY,I really gotta pee.
164534,L151344,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What?
164535,L151342,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
164536,L151341,u4731,m314,GREGORY,They say sex is great for cramps.
164537,L151340,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS."
164538,L151339,u4731,m314,GREGORY,"Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?"
164539,L151338,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'm really tired.
164540,L151337,u4731,m314,GREGORY,"Hey, how about a little nightcap?"
164541,L151336,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
164542,L151334,u4729,m314,FRIDA,That's great. Highly original.
164543,L151333,u4731,m314,GREGORY,"Well, whattdaya think?"
164544,L151332,u4731,m314,GREGORY,"So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, ""Son, you got into Harvard!"" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating."
164545,L151328,u4731,m314,GREGORY,"You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat."
164546,L151327,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'm not really hungry after all.
164547,L151326,u4731,m314,GREGORY,"Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf."
164548,L151324,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Starving.
164549,L151323,u4731,m314,GREGORY,You hungry?
164550,L151276,u4731,m314,GREGORY,"No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?"
164551,L151275,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"You're kidding, really?"
164552,L151274,u4731,m314,GREGORY,"Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay."
164553,L151273,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I do development for TV movies.
164554,L151272,u4731,m314,GREGORY,So you're Grant's secretary?
164555,L151271,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I know.
164556,L151762,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Take your shower.
164557,L151761,u4734,m314,MARK,Wow.
164558,L151760,u4734,m314,MARK,Yeah?
164559,L151759,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Mark.
164560,L151756,u4734,m314,MARK,"I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?"
164561,L151755,u4729,m314,FRIDA,My bra is my biggest supporter.
164562,L151754,u4734,m314,MARK,"Come on, I'm your biggest supporter."
164563,L151753,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
164564,L151752,u4734,m314,MARK,It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
164565,L151751,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
164566,L151750,u4734,m314,MARK,These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
164567,L151749,u4729,m314,FRIDA,So pay them back and apologize.
164568,L151748,u4734,m314,MARK,I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
164569,L151747,u4734,m314,MARK,"Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in."
164570,L151746,u4729,m314,FRIDA,This really isn't a good time.
164571,L151745,u4734,m314,MARK,It's a matter of life and death.
164572,L151741,u4729,m314,FRIDA,It's Mark.
164573,L151740,u4734,m314,MARK,Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
164574,L151480,u4734,m314,MARK,"I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?"
164575,L151479,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Where'd you get the bike?
164576,L151306,u4734,m314,MARK,I'm working on it...
164577,L151305,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
164578,L151304,u4734,m314,MARK,"Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me..."
164579,L151303,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Yeah right... You better go.
164580,L151302,u4734,m314,MARK,"Frida, you know you're it for me."
164581,L151301,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
164582,L151300,u4734,m314,MARK,"OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?"
164583,L151298,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"I can't help it, it smells so good."
164584,L151297,u4734,m314,MARK,Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
164585,L151296,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Oh my god, I'm sorry!"
164586,L151295,u4734,m314,MARK,Look what you did!
164587,L151293,u4729,m314,FRIDA,No.
164588,L151292,u4734,m314,MARK,You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
164589,L151291,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You never say that.
164590,L151290,u4734,m314,MARK,You look different. I mean you look good.
164591,L151288,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Since when do you care?
164592,L151287,u4734,m314,MARK,"What, you got a date or somethin'?"
164593,L151874,u4736,m314,MR. GRANT,Very well then. Is that all?
164594,L151873,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them."
164595,L151872,u4736,m314,MR. GRANT,No?
164596,L151871,u4729,m314,FRIDA,No.
164597,L151870,u4736,m314,MR. GRANT,Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
164598,L151869,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
164599,L151462,u4736,m314,MR. GRANT,I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
164600,L151461,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I think we should do something with strong female characters...
164601,L151460,u4736,m314,MR. GRANT,"Yes, that's what we're looking for."
164602,L151459,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
164603,L151440,u4729,m314,FRIDA,A little.
164604,L151439,u4736,m314,MR. GRANT,Did you change your hair?
164605,L151438,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"How about a ""Man in Jeopardy"" story?"
164606,L151219,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Your desk.
164607,L151218,u4736,m314,MR. GRANT,Coffee and...
164608,L151217,u4729,m314,FRIDA,On your desk.
164609,L151216,u4736,m314,MR. GRANT,Script coverage?
164610,L151215,u4729,m314,FRIDA,On your desk.
164611,L151214,u4736,m314,MR. GRANT,The Nielson's?
164612,L152042,u4737,m314,PETER,Thanks.
164613,L152041,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Here's a towel.
164614,L152030,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Okay.
164615,L152029,u4737,m314,PETER,I'm going to take a shower.
164616,L152026,u4737,m314,PETER,I know. The important thing is that it stop.
164617,L152025,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
164618,L152024,u4737,m314,PETER,No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
164619,L152023,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What about... those guys... I might have...
164620,L152022,u4737,m314,PETER,"Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer."
164621,L152021,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Worse than this?
164622,L152020,u4737,m314,PETER,We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
164623,L152019,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
164624,L152018,u4737,m314,PETER,I knew you wouldn't kill me.
164625,L152015,u4737,m314,PETER,I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
164626,L152014,u4729,m314,FRIDA,No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
164627,L152013,u4737,m314,PETER,Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
164628,L152012,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Be careful!
164629,L152010,u4737,m314,PETER,I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
164630,L152009,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
164631,L152008,u4737,m314,PETER,I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
164632,L152007,u4729,m314,FRIDA,How do you know?
164633,L152006,u4737,m314,PETER,I don't think you'll hurt me.
164634,L152005,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Peter I love you too but...
164635,L152004,u4737,m314,PETER,I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
164636,L152003,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Go away. I might hurt you.
164637,L151992,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
164638,L151991,u4737,m314,PETER,"If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf."
164639,L151990,u4729,m314,FRIDA,No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
164640,L151989,u4737,m314,PETER,"Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that."
164641,L151988,u4729,m314,FRIDA,You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
164642,L151987,u4737,m314,PETER,You at least owe me the truth.
164643,L151986,u4737,m314,PETER,"Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?"
164644,L151985,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really."
164645,L151984,u4737,m314,PETER,What? Is there someone else?
164646,L151983,u4729,m314,FRIDA,NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
164647,L151982,u4737,m314,PETER,"Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over."
164648,L151981,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Hello?
164649,L151944,u4737,m314,PETER,No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
164650,L151943,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
164651,L151942,u4737,m314,PETER,"No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural."
164652,L151941,u4729,m314,FRIDA,They do? Oh no...
164653,L151940,u4737,m314,PETER,Your breasts feel larger.
164654,L151913,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
164655,L151912,u4737,m314,PETER,"You know, I've never seen your cat."
164656,L151911,u4729,m314,FRIDA,They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
164657,L151910,u4737,m314,PETER,What's with the squirt guns?
164658,L151909,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I love you too.
164659,L151908,u4737,m314,PETER,You didn't say it.
164660,L151907,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it."
164661,L151906,u4737,m314,PETER,Is that how you feel?
164662,L151905,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say ""I love you too"" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it."
164663,L151904,u4737,m314,PETER,Is it that funny?
164664,L151902,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, my bite's a lot worse."
164665,L151901,u4737,m314,PETER,You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
164666,L151900,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"This is a lot worse than ""Betty."""
164667,L151899,u4737,m314,PETER,"That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, ""You're talking to Betty now"" and we'd leave the house for a few days."
164668,L151889,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Interesting possibility.
164669,L151888,u4737,m314,PETER,Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
164670,L151887,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, but thanks for the warning."
164671,L151886,u4737,m314,PETER,Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
164672,L151885,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What's that supposed to mean?
164673,L151884,u4737,m314,PETER,Except Mark of course.
164674,L151883,u4737,m314,PETER,"Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead."
164675,L151882,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
164676,L151881,u4737,m314,PETER,"I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all."
164677,L151880,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What happened?
164678,L151879,u4737,m314,PETER,What happened?
164679,L151878,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, I got it. It's okay."
164680,L151877,u4737,m314,PETER,I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
164681,L151876,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
164682,L151875,u4737,m314,PETER,Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
164683,L151851,u4737,m314,PETER,He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
164684,L151850,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, why?"
164685,L151848,u4737,m314,PETER,Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
164686,L151847,u4729,m314,FRIDA,But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
164687,L151845,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
164688,L151844,u4737,m314,PETER,"No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date."
164689,L151824,u4729,m314,FRIDA,It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
164690,L151823,u4737,m314,PETER,You had a date with Carlton?
164691,L151807,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
164692,L151806,u4737,m314,PETER,"Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important."
164693,L151805,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Uh.... hi!
164694,L151658,u4737,m314,PETER,A man killed in Central Park.
164695,L151657,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Everything okay?
164696,L151653,u4729,m314,FRIDA,NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
164697,L151652,u4737,m314,PETER,"You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?"
164698,L151651,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No. Nope, nothing in it."
164699,L151650,u4737,m314,PETER,Was there anything in that washer?
164700,L151648,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
164701,L151647,u4737,m314,PETER,No. I was doing my laundry.
164702,L151646,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?"
164703,L151546,u4737,m314,PETER,"Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you."
164704,L151545,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this."
164705,L151544,u4737,m314,PETER,I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
164706,L151541,u4729,m314,FRIDA,My period? No.
164707,L151540,u4737,m314,PETER,"Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?"
164708,L151539,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What's wrong?
164709,L151538,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Okay, you busted me."
164710,L151537,u4737,m314,PETER,"I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left..."
164711,L151534,u4737,m314,PETER,Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
164712,L151533,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What are they for?
164713,L151532,u4737,m314,PETER,Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
164714,L151531,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What are those?
164715,L151521,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Goodnight.
164716,L151520,u4737,m314,PETER,Goodnight.
164717,L151519,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Yeah. Maybe.
164718,L151518,u4737,m314,PETER,Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
164719,L151517,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I really gotta get going.
164720,L151516,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date."
164721,L151515,u4737,m314,PETER,Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
164722,L151514,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
164723,L151513,u4737,m314,PETER,Briefs.
164724,L151512,u4729,m314,FRIDA,How about you? Briefs or boxers?
164725,L151510,u4737,m314,PETER,Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
164726,L151509,u4729,m314,FRIDA,A lot of people don't wear underwear.
164727,L151508,u4737,m314,PETER,You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
164728,L151507,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Like what?
164729,L151506,u4737,m314,PETER,Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
164730,L151505,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild."
164731,L151504,u4737,m314,PETER,"The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since."
164732,L151503,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective."
164733,L151502,u4737,m314,PETER,We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
164734,L151501,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Oh my god, by wolves?"
164735,L151500,u4737,m314,PETER,I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
164736,L151499,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'm sorry.
164737,L151498,u4737,m314,PETER,"No, she died when I was twelve."
164738,L151497,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Used to? Did it stop finally?
164739,L151496,u4737,m314,PETER,My mom used to get PMS too.
164740,L151495,u4737,m314,PETER,I can forgive you a bestseller.
164741,L151494,u4729,m314,FRIDA,It's stupid.
164742,L151493,u4737,m314,PETER,"No really, I love knowing what people read."
164743,L151492,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Oh, it's nothing."
164744,L151491,u4737,m314,PETER,So what book did you buy?
164745,L151490,u4737,m314,PETER,Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
164746,L151489,u4729,m314,FRIDA,No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
164747,L151488,u4737,m314,PETER,Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
164748,L151487,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
164749,L151486,u4737,m314,PETER,You wanna get some coffee?
164750,L151485,u4737,m314,PETER,There's a lot of that going around.
164751,L151484,u4729,m314,FRIDA,That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
164752,L151483,u4737,m314,PETER,Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
164753,L151477,u4737,m314,PETER,At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
164754,L151476,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
164755,L151475,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Intriguing?
164756,L151474,u4737,m314,PETER,No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
164757,L151473,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Are you following me?
164758,L151472,u4737,m314,PETER,You busted me.
164759,L151383,u4737,m314,PETER,"Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call."
164760,L151382,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
164761,L151377,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it."
164762,L151376,u4737,m314,PETER,When's the last time you saw him?
164763,L151680,u4738,m314,SHRINK,"You use the word ""fucking."" You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex."
164764,L151679,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
164765,L151678,u4738,m314,SHRINK,"You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose ""eating him"" as the method of killing?"
164766,L151677,u4729,m314,FRIDA,We didn't have sex.
164767,L151676,u4738,m314,SHRINK,Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
164768,L151675,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
164769,L151674,u4738,m314,SHRINK,And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
164770,L151673,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I ate a guy last night.
164771,L151672,u4738,m314,SHRINK,Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
164772,L151671,u4729,m314,FRIDA,I think I'm a werewolf.
164773,L151225,u4738,m314,SHRINK,"Oh, I see... interesting theory."
164774,L151224,u4729,m314,FRIDA,That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
164775,L151840,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Packages of money.
164776,L151839,u4729,m314,FRIDA,No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
164777,L151832,u4733,m314,LLOYD,How big?
164778,L151831,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, I have a cat."
164779,L151830,u4733,m314,LLOYD,You got a dog?
164780,L151829,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone."
164781,L151826,u4729,m314,FRIDA,What makes you think I was the last one?
164782,L151825,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
164783,L151822,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?"
164784,L151821,u4733,m314,LLOYD,You heard about Carlton Fraser?
164785,L151388,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, take it."
164786,L151387,u4733,m314,LLOYD,We can get a warrant if you like.
164787,L151379,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, I said it was our first date."
164788,L151378,u4733,m314,LLOYD,A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
164789,L151375,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
164790,L151374,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"No, it was our first date."
164791,L151373,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
164792,L151372,u4729,m314,FRIDA,Yes... I... we had dinner.
164793,L151366,u4729,m314,FRIDA,"Oh my god, what happened?"
164794,L151365,u4733,m314,LLOYD,It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
164795,L151688,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her."
164796,L151687,u4730,m314,GEORGE,You can't believe this bullshit.
164797,L151686,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Take some allergy medicine.
164798,L151685,u4730,m314,GEORGE,Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
164799,L151684,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves."
164800,L151683,u4730,m314,GEORGE,You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
164801,L151682,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
164802,L151681,u4730,m314,GEORGE,I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
164803,L151626,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Tell her I'm eating.
164804,L151625,u4730,m314,GEORGE,It's for you. Frida.
164805,L151617,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
164806,L151616,u4730,m314,GEORGE,Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
164807,L151615,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
164808,L151563,u4730,m314,GEORGE,She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
164809,L151562,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
164810,L151561,u4730,m314,GEORGE,She's just so... pathetic.
164811,L151560,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell."
164812,L151205,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
164813,L151204,u4730,m314,GEORGE,He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
164814,L151171,u4730,m314,GEORGE,"Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off."
164815,L151170,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"So I asked the bartender what ""coyote ugly"" meant. It's like the ""bagger"" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger..."
164816,L151838,u4737,m314,PETER,He's been running money for the Mafia.
164817,L151837,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,See he was cheating from the get go.
164818,L151817,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,"I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun."
164819,L151816,u4737,m314,PETER,Why would you want to be a cop?
164820,L151815,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
164821,L151386,u4737,m314,PETER,We can just take this pillowcase.
164822,L151385,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,You want her sheets?
164823,L151381,u4737,m314,PETER,We're just trying to figure out what happened.
164824,L151380,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,How the hell is that your business?
164825,L151371,u4737,m314,PETER,"Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night."
164826,L151370,u4732,m314,JENNIFER,Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
164827,L152002,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
164828,L152001,u4737,m314,PETER,What kind of animal?
164829,L152000,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
164830,L151999,u4737,m314,PETER,Did we get those DNA tests back?
164831,L151998,u4733,m314,LLOYD,And that was 28 days ago today.
164832,L151997,u4737,m314,PETER,So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
164833,L151996,u4733,m314,LLOYD,She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
164834,L151995,u4737,m314,PETER,What makes her think that?
164835,L151994,u4733,m314,LLOYD,My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
164836,L151924,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
164837,L151923,u4737,m314,PETER,What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
164838,L151922,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house..."
164839,L151921,u4737,m314,PETER,What are you talking about?
164840,L151920,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"And fifth, you're dating her."
164841,L151919,u4737,m314,PETER,"Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer."
164842,L151918,u4733,m314,LLOYD,It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
164843,L151917,u4737,m314,PETER,Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
164844,L151916,u4733,m314,LLOYD,You think mafia hit?
164845,L151860,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Like a vampire or some shit?
164846,L151859,u4737,m314,PETER,It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
164847,L151858,u4733,m314,LLOYD,It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
164848,L151857,u4737,m314,PETER,Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
164849,L151842,u4733,m314,LLOYD,One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
164850,L151841,u4737,m314,PETER,Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
164851,L151828,u4733,m314,LLOYD,This one walk you home too?
164852,L151827,u4737,m314,PETER,He means the last that we know of.
164853,L151797,u4737,m314,PETER,She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
164854,L151796,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
164855,L151795,u4737,m314,PETER,"Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him."
164856,L151794,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes."
164857,L151793,u4737,m314,PETER,The park dude was missing an arm.
164858,L151792,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park."
164859,L151726,u4737,m314,PETER,"You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex."
164860,L151725,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
164861,L151724,u4737,m314,PETER,"She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys."
164862,L151723,u4733,m314,LLOYD,She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
164863,L151722,u4737,m314,PETER,"Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them."
164864,L151721,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead."
164865,L151720,u4737,m314,PETER,We only live a few blocks apart.
164866,L151719,u4733,m314,LLOYD,I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
164867,L151697,u4733,m314,LLOYD,And he was missing an arm.
164868,L151696,u4737,m314,PETER,He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
164869,L151455,u4733,m314,LLOYD,And you think I'm sick?
164870,L151454,u4737,m314,PETER,What?
164871,L151453,u4737,m314,PETER,Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
164872,L151452,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush."
164873,L151451,u4737,m314,PETER,Madonna's in Penthouse?
164874,L151450,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
164875,L151449,u4737,m314,PETER,Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
164876,L151448,u4733,m314,LLOYD,I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
164877,L151447,u4737,m314,PETER,She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
164878,L151446,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"Hey, there was a lot of blood."
164879,L151445,u4737,m314,PETER,I told you she was innocent.
164880,L151444,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
164881,L151427,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive."
164882,L151426,u4737,m314,PETER,I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
164883,L151425,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her."
164884,L151424,u4737,m314,PETER,"Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?"
164885,L151423,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick."
164886,L151422,u4737,m314,PETER,That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
164887,L151421,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird."
164888,L151368,u4733,m314,LLOYD,Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
164889,L151367,u4737,m314,PETER,He was found a few blocks away.
164890,L151281,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days."
164891,L151280,u4737,m314,PETER,You're some catch Lloyd.
164892,L151279,u4733,m314,LLOYD,You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
164893,L151278,u4737,m314,PETER,"Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?"
164894,L151277,u4733,m314,LLOYD,"Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too."
164895,L153146,u4739,m315,BARBER,"Yeah, Im like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure cant complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this aint no fucking rug! Ghead.  Feel it!  All mine!"
164896,L153145,u4749,m315,WHITE,Not really...
164897,L153144,u4739,m315,BARBER,"Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?"
164898,L153141,u4739,m315,BARBER,"Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?"
164899,L153140,u4749,m315,WHITE,The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
164900,L153139,u4739,m315,BARBER,What of?
164901,L153138,u4749,m315,WHITE,Sell maps?
164902,L153135,u4739,m315,BARBER,Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
164903,L153134,u4749,m315,WHITE,Thanks.  Just some pills.
164904,L153133,u4739,m315,BARBER,Looks like you need a haircut to me.
164905,L153132,u4749,m315,WHITE,I need something to keep me awake.
164906,L153400,u4741,m315,COP,"Well, sir...  I don't know exactly."
164907,L153399,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,How will we interrogate them?
164908,L153398,u4741,m315,COP,They don't speak English...
164909,L153393,u4741,m315,COP,No one available.
164910,L153392,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
164911,L153391,u4741,m315,COP,His wife.
164912,L153390,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,The other one?
164913,L153389,u4741,m315,COP,All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
164914,L153293,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
164915,L153292,u4741,m315,COP,Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
164916,L153291,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,What's he doing here?
164917,L153174,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Spinning backwards?
164918,L153173,u4741,m315,COP,Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
164919,L153172,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,How long have you been here?
164920,L153488,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,I'm afraid so.
164921,L153487,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Was that for real down there?
164922,L153467,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself."
164923,L153466,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,What is this place?
164924,L153465,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Just like that?
164925,L153464,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,In there.
164926,L153463,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
164927,L153462,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"Please, they'll kill me..."
164928,L153459,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,You are mistaken.
164929,L153458,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
164930,L153457,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,I don't know what you're talking about.
164931,L153456,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin..."
164932,L153322,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Loose ends?
164933,L153321,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends."
164934,L153320,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"Yes, of course.  Everything's fine..."
164935,L153319,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
164936,L153318,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,He's seriously disturbed...
164937,L153317,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Really?  And how is his state of mind?
164938,L153316,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Just visiting my patient.
164939,L153315,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Doctor!  What brings you here?
164940,L153255,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
164941,L153254,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,He tried to kill me!
164942,L153253,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Police.  Nobody move.
164943,L153340,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"Yes, sir."
164944,L153339,u4747,m315,STROMBOLI,"Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that."
164945,L153335,u4747,m315,STROMBOLI,How could you have been so stupid?
164946,L153334,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed..."
164947,L153329,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,I see...
164948,L153328,u4747,m315,STROMBOLI,Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
164949,L153131,u4747,m315,STROMBOLI,"What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead..."
164950,L153130,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Lost something?
164951,L153129,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me..."
164952,L153128,u4747,m315,STROMBOLI,Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
164953,L153127,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Its extremely important to my investigation...
164954,L153126,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,A hunch.  He might be able to...
164955,L153125,u4747,m315,STROMBOLI,Why do you want to speak to him?
164956,L153072,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"Shes getting better, thanks.  She..."
164957,L153071,u4747,m315,STROMBOLI,"Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?"
164958,L153070,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?"
164959,L153068,u4747,m315,STROMBOLI,"I see.  One things for sure, hes ambitious. Youll be a busy man from now on."
164960,L153067,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"Germs, sir.  These places are full of them."
164961,L153066,u4747,m315,STROMBOLI,Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
164962,L153062,u4747,m315,STROMBOLI,Yes.  This way.
164963,L153061,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"Good evening, sir."
164964,L153417,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
164965,L153416,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,"Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?"
164966,L153415,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
164967,L153413,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Put it through...
164968,L153412,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
164969,L153411,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Who is it?
164970,L153119,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"Well be more careful, please."
164971,L153118,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,"Why, yes."
164972,L153117,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Do you wash your hands before you type things?
164973,L153116,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,Im sorry...
164974,L153115,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,How can I submit this?
164975,L153114,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
164976,L153113,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,It seems fine.
164977,L153112,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Wrong?  Look at this!
164978,L153111,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,"Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?"
164979,L153110,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,You typed this report?
164980,L153097,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Fine.
164981,L153096,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,"You wont regret this, sir."
164982,L153095,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Good.
164983,L153094,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,"Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man."
164984,L153093,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
164985,L153092,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,I didnt requisition a secretary.
164986,L153091,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,Im your new assistant.
164987,L153090,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,Patricia Crenshaw.
164988,L153089,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
164989,L153088,u4743,m315,MISS CRENSHAW,"Sorry, sir."
164990,L153087,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Dammit!
164991,L153492,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
164992,L153491,u4749,m315,WHITE,What now?
164993,L153472,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,It sure isn't the fun-fair.
164994,L153471,u4749,m315,WHITE,Where do you think this goes?
164995,L153454,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"Why, that's ridiculous.  You just..."
164996,L153453,u4749,m315,WHITE,"Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there."
164997,L153452,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Go on.
164998,L153449,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject."
164999,L153448,u4749,m315,WHITE,What?
165000,L153447,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,They didn't have faces.
165001,L153428,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"Don't know much, do you?"
165002,L153427,u4749,m315,WHITE,Don't know that either.
165003,L153426,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Why are they after you?
165004,L153425,u4749,m315,WHITE,I don't know who they are.
165005,L153424,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Who?
165006,L153423,u4749,m315,WHITE,People...  after me.
165007,L153422,u4749,m315,WHITE,I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
165008,L153421,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
165009,L153420,u4749,m315,WHITE,I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
165010,L153419,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Why give yourself up?
165011,L153267,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Shut-up.
165012,L153266,u4749,m315,WHITE,Where are we going?
165013,L153385,u4748,m315,THOMPSON,"A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone."
165014,L153384,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,But...  How long has this been happening?
165015,L153383,u4748,m315,THOMPSON,No...  No doctor...
165016,L153382,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
165017,L153379,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,What is going on?
165018,L153378,u4748,m315,THOMPSON,"Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now."
165019,L153377,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,What?  Who has?
165020,L153376,u4748,m315,THOMPSON,"They've taken my mind, my memories..."
165021,L153372,u4748,m315,THOMPSON,Not that.  Anything else.
165022,L153371,u4740,m315,BUMSTEAD,"I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk."
165023,L153370,u4748,m315,THOMPSON,Can't let you in...  sorry.
165024,L153517,u4742,m315,KARL,It must be a closet or something.
165025,L153516,u4749,m315,WHITE,Where does it lead?
165026,L153515,u4742,m315,KARL,Yes.
165027,L153514,u4749,m315,WHITE,You see it?
165028,L153513,u4749,m315,WHITE,No.  Have a look.
165029,L153512,u4742,m315,KARL,Such a joker!  Like your father.
165030,L153511,u4749,m315,WHITE,There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
165031,L153510,u4742,m315,KARL,Which one?
165032,L153509,u4749,m315,WHITE,What is that door?
165033,L153508,u4742,m315,KARL,Look!  This is a good one!
165034,L153588,u4744,m315,MISTER BLACK,"Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant."
165035,L153587,u4749,m315,WHITE,I didn't realise...
165036,L153584,u4749,m315,WHITE,"Wait, this isn't fair..."
165037,L153583,u4744,m315,MISTER BLACK,"I see.  The verdict, yes..."
165038,L153582,u4749,m315,WHITE,But I...
165039,L153581,u4744,m315,MISTER BLACK,A book of delusions.  Anything else?
165040,L153574,u4749,m315,WHITE,Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
165041,L153573,u4744,m315,MISTER BLACK,"A fanciful idea, Mister White."
165042,L153170,u4745,m315,PRIEST,Please...
165043,L153169,u4749,m315,WHITE,Shut up!
165044,L153168,u4745,m315,PRIEST,Dont kill me!
165045,L153165,u4749,m315,WHITE,"Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you."
165046,L153164,u4745,m315,PRIEST,I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
165047,L153163,u4749,m315,WHITE,No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
165048,L153162,u4745,m315,PRIEST,Then we must call the police.
165049,L153161,u4749,m315,WHITE,Someones after me.
165050,L153160,u4745,m315,PRIEST,You seem restless.
165051,L153159,u4749,m315,WHITE,"No.  I, ah..."
165052,L153543,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,We are...  living in their dreams...
165053,L153542,u4749,m315,WHITE,What is it?
165054,L153540,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,I'm...  being...  punished.
165055,L153539,u4749,m315,WHITE,What happened to you?
165056,L153461,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Nothing.  I don't know anything!
165057,L153460,u4749,m315,WHITE,What are you hiding?
165058,L153312,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
165059,L153311,u4749,m315,WHITE,It's a trick.
165060,L153308,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
165061,L153307,u4749,m315,WHITE,Why?
165062,L153306,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
165063,L153305,u4749,m315,WHITE,You've been working too hard.
165064,L153302,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything..."
165065,L153301,u4749,m315,WHITE,Not that again...
165066,L153300,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer."
165067,L153299,u4749,m315,WHITE,So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
165068,L153298,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"No, it's the truth."
165069,L153297,u4749,m315,WHITE,You're a liar!
165070,L153243,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...
165071,L153242,u4749,m315,WHITE,I have to go...
165072,L153241,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,What are you doing?
165073,L153231,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
165074,L153230,u4749,m315,WHITE,I'm sorry.  About before.
165075,L153222,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Maybe.
165076,L153221,u4749,m315,WHITE,Can I get my life back?
165077,L153219,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"Anything <u>but</u>, my friend."
165078,L153218,u4749,m315,WHITE,I'm nothing then.
165079,L153217,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting."
165080,L153215,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something."
165081,L153214,u4749,m315,WHITE,Horrible...
165082,L153213,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet."
165083,L153212,u4749,m315,WHITE,Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
165084,L153209,u4749,m315,WHITE,"I told you, I can't remember a thing!"
165085,L153208,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
165086,L153207,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Well...
165087,L153206,u4749,m315,WHITE,Known me for long?
165088,L153205,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
165089,L153204,u4749,m315,WHITE,"You're supposed to be my doctor, right?"
165090,L153203,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,If you like.
165091,L153202,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Tell me about them...
165092,L153201,u4749,m315,WHITE,Yes.
165093,L153200,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Bad dreams?
165094,L153199,u4749,m315,WHITE,That's what people keep telling me.
165095,L153198,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Your name is John White.
165096,L153197,u4749,m315,WHITE,"Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>."
165097,L153196,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,What does she say?  The woman.
165098,L153195,u4749,m315,WHITE,Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
165099,L153194,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,Water?
165100,L153193,u4749,m315,WHITE,You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
165101,L153192,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,"Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try."
165102,L153191,u4749,m315,WHITE,You know something about me?
165103,L153190,u4746,m315,SCHREBER,You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
165104,L153364,u4750,m315,WIFE,That's easy.  You...
165105,L153363,u4749,m315,WHITE,How do I get there?  Tell me.
165106,L153356,u4750,m315,WIFE,"They're dead, John."
165107,L153355,u4749,m315,WHITE,I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
165108,L153354,u4750,m315,WIFE,Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
165109,L153353,u4749,m315,WHITE,How do you know I'm innocent?
165110,L153352,u4750,m315,WIFE,It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
165111,L153351,u4749,m315,WHITE,"I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life..."
165112,L155671,u4752,m316,DAVE,I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
165113,L155670,u4751,m316,BOB,"Die, you pond scum!"
165114,L155509,u4752,m316,DAVE,Fine.
165115,L155508,u4751,m316,BOB,Fine?
165116,L155507,u4752,m316,DAVE,Fine...
165117,L155506,u4751,m316,BOB,You're fired.
165118,L155505,u4752,m316,DAVE,Yeah.

165261,L154985,u4751,m316,BOB,"It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops."
165262,L154984,u4758,m316,REED,Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
165263,L154946,u4758,m316,REED,Yes.

165294,L155278,u4752,m316,DAVE,It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.

165298,L155274,u4752,m316,DAVE,You could buy it on payments.
165299,L155273,u4756,m316,MURRAY,You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?

165305,L155267,u4756,m316,MURRAY,"I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?"
165306,L155266,u4752,m316,DAVE,I'm not sure.

165503,L155641,u4752,m316,DAVE,"Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little..."

165628,L156787,u4760,m317,CHICO,Please....shoot me.
165629,L156783,u4769,m317,RHODES,Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.

165668,L156976,u4767,m317,MARY,...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
165669,L156975,u4762,m317,GASPARILLA,"Miss Henried, I think you better..."
165670,L156972,u4762,m317,GASPARILLA,"Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?"
165671,L156971,u4767,m317,MARY,I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
165672,L156970,u4762,m317,GASPARILLA,"Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'."
165673,L157179,u4763,m317,JOHN,"Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind."
165674,L157178,u4770,m317,SARAH,How long do we have to watch him?
165675,L157159,u4770,m317,SARAH,It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
165676,L157158,u4763,m317,JOHN,What is it?
165677,L157063,u4763,m317,JOHN,We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
165678,L157062,u4770,m317,SARAH,Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
165679,L157057,u4770,m317,SARAH,There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
165680,L157056,u4763,m317,JOHN,We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
165681,L157055,u4770,m317,SARAH,"Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!"
165682,L157054,u4763,m317,JOHN,Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
165683,L157053,u4770,m317,SARAH,What?
165684,L157052,u4763,m317,JOHN,Datura.
165685,L157051,u4770,m317,SARAH,Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
165686,L157006,u4763,m317,JOHN,He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
165687,L157005,u4770,m317,SARAH,Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
165688,L156941,u4763,m317,JOHN,"You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers."
165689,L156940,u4770,m317,SARAH,They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
165690,L156845,u4770,m317,SARAH,"No. They just try to hold you for ransom. Fuck you, Moses! I'm outa here!"
165691,L156844,u4763,m317,JOHN,Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
165692,L156843,u4770,m317,SARAH,I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
165693,L156841,u4763,m317,JOHN,You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
165694,L156840,u4770,m317,SARAH,"Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic."
165695,L156839,u4763,m317,JOHN,That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
165696,L156838,u4770,m317,SARAH,"Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch."
165697,L156837,u4763,m317,JOHN,"I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here."
165698,L156836,u4770,m317,SARAH,We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
165699,L156835,u4763,m317,JOHN,That sounds like a curse to me.
165700,L156834,u4770,m317,SARAH,It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
165701,L156833,u4763,m317,JOHN,What is it if it ain't a curse?
165702,L156832,u4770,m317,SARAH,Curse?
165703,L156831,u4763,m317,JOHN,How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
165704,L156830,u4770,m317,SARAH,The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
165705,L156828,u4763,m317,JOHN,"I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you."
165706,L156827,u4770,m317,SARAH,Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
165707,L156825,u4763,m317,JOHN,"Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything."
165708,L156824,u4770,m317,SARAH,We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
165709,L156823,u4763,m317,JOHN,"That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course."
165710,L156822,u4770,m317,SARAH,Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
165711,L156821,u4763,m317,JOHN,He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
165712,L156820,u4770,m317,SARAH,Gasparilla?
165713,L156819,u4763,m317,JOHN,Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
165714,L157106,u4771,m317,TOBY,Come on!
165715,L157105,u4763,m317,JOHN,What you wanna do?
165716,L157104,u4771,m317,TOBY,That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
165717,L157065,u4763,m317,JOHN,Come on. Let's go.
165718,L157064,u4771,m317,TOBY,That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
165719,L157061,u4763,m317,JOHN,"I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha..."
165720,L157060,u4771,m317,TOBY,"If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you."
165721,L157059,u4763,m317,JOHN,Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
165722,L157058,u4771,m317,TOBY,This stuff really works? No shit?
165723,L157044,u4771,m317,TOBY,A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
165724,L157043,u4763,m317,JOHN,We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
165725,L157042,u4771,m317,TOBY,What?
165726,L157041,u4763,m317,JOHN,We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
165727,L157040,u4771,m317,TOBY,"Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?"
165728,L157039,u4763,m317,JOHN,"We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby."
165729,L157038,u4771,m317,TOBY,"It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go."
165730,L157029,u4771,m317,TOBY,"I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles."
165731,L157028,u4763,m317,JOHN,I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
165732,L157027,u4771,m317,TOBY,What?
165733,L157026,u4763,m317,JOHN,We got a boat.
165734,L157025,u4771,m317,TOBY,There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
165735,L157024,u4771,m317,TOBY,He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
165736,L157023,u4763,m317,JOHN,"What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?"
165737,L157013,u4763,m317,JOHN,Maybe.
165738,L157012,u4771,m317,TOBY,Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
165739,L157011,u4763,m317,JOHN,The hospital?
165740,L157010,u4771,m317,TOBY,I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
165741,L157009,u4771,m317,TOBY,Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
165742,L157008,u4763,m317,JOHN,Ain't no place safe.
165743,L157007,u4771,m317,TOBY,It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
165744,L156866,u4769,m317,RHODES,"The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there."
165745,L156865,u4764,m317,JULIE,I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
165746,L156864,u4769,m317,RHODES,"They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this."
165747,L156863,u4764,m317,JULIE,But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
165748,L156862,u4769,m317,RHODES,Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
165749,L156861,u4764,m317,JULIE,I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
165750,L156743,u4768,m317,MIGUEL,No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
165751,L156742,u4766,m317,MARIA,"You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done."
165752,L156741,u4768,m317,MIGUEL,"One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe."
165753,L156740,u4766,m317,MARIA,We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
165754,L156739,u4768,m317,MIGUEL,Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
165755,L156733,u4768,m317,MIGUEL,No. The disease was cut away from me. I will live. I will live.
165756,L156732,u4766,m317,MARIA,"You are dying, too."
165757,L156731,u4768,m317,MIGUEL,He is dying. He knows it.
165758,L156730,u4772,m317,TONY,"...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love..."
165759,L156729,u4766,m317,MARIA,NOOOOOOOOO!
165760,L156727,u4772,m317,TONY,I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
165761,L156726,u4766,m317,MARIA,"Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest."
165762,L156725,u4772,m317,TONY,Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
165763,L156721,u4772,m317,TONY,PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
165764,L156720,u4766,m317,MARIA,TONY....TONY....
165765,L156706,u4772,m317,TONY,I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
165766,L156705,u4766,m317,MARIA,Dios mia.
165767,L156974,u4767,m317,MARY,"Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is..."
165768,L156973,u4769,m317,RHODES,"Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to..."
165769,L156887,u4769,m317,RHODES,"No, Miss Science. You're the one who needs to do some thinking."
165770,L156886,u4767,m317,MARY,"You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!"
165771,L156885,u4769,m317,RHODES,I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
165772,L156881,u4767,m317,MARY,"Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned."
165773,L156880,u4769,m317,RHODES,"Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat."
165774,L156879,u4767,m317,MARY,If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
165775,L156878,u4769,m317,RHODES,"Oh, I have no doubt."
165776,L156877,u4767,m317,MARY,Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
165777,L156876,u4769,m317,RHODES,"And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'."
165778,L156875,u4767,m317,MARY,You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
165779,L156874,u4767,m317,MARY,"Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!"
165780,L156873,u4769,m317,RHODES,"You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh."
165781,L156868,u4769,m317,RHODES,"They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!"
165782,L156867,u4767,m317,MARY,You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
165783,L156859,u4769,m317,RHODES,No wonder they're so....hungry.
165784,L156858,u4767,m317,MARY,You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
165785,L156857,u4769,m317,RHODES,God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
165786,L156856,u4767,m317,MARY,"God....damn you, Rhodes!"
165787,L156855,u4769,m317,RHODES,"Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse."
165788,L156911,u4771,m317,TOBY,MARY!
165789,L156910,u4767,m317,MARY,"I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and..."
165790,L156909,u4771,m317,TOBY,Mary.
165791,L156900,u4771,m317,TOBY,For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
165792,L156899,u4767,m317,MARY,I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
165793,L156898,u4771,m317,TOBY,Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
165794,L156897,u4767,m317,MARY,"I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need..."
165795,L156896,u4771,m317,TOBY,We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
165796,L156895,u4767,m317,MARY,I want you to leave. Then maybe...
165797,L156894,u4771,m317,TOBY,"Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick."
165798,L156893,u4767,m317,MARY,It's because of me.
165799,L156892,u4771,m317,TOBY,That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
165800,L156891,u4767,m317,MARY,Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
165801,L156890,u4771,m317,TOBY,Hey. Slow down. What is it?
165802,L156889,u4767,m317,MARY,Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
165803,L156814,u4771,m317,TOBY,"In the battle, sir."
165804,L156813,u4769,m317,RHODES,It's been fired.
165805,L156812,u4769,m317,RHODES,Let me see your weapon.
165806,L156811,u4771,m317,TOBY,"No, sir."
165807,L156810,u4769,m317,RHODES,"You fired that shot, didn't you?"
165808,L156809,u4771,m317,TOBY,Sir!
165809,L156808,u4769,m317,RHODES,"Step up here, Tyler."
165810,L156805,u4769,m317,RHODES,"I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear."
165811,L156804,u4771,m317,TOBY,"Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial."
165812,L156803,u4769,m317,RHODES,No time for that. I'll take care of them.
165813,L156802,u4771,m317,TOBY,"My...""detail"", sir. We're going to bury the heads."
165814,L156801,u4769,m317,RHODES,"Where are you going, Tyler?"

165848,L157621,u4776,m318,CHARLIE,What is the point?
165849,L157620,u4782,m318,KNOX,"Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!"
165850,L157619,u4776,m318,CHARLIE,So you really think she means you're going with her?

165869,L157395,u4782,m318,KNOX,What is the Dead Poets Society?

165881,L157456,u4776,m318,CHARLIE,"Yaa, I'm a dead poet!"
165882,L157437,u4776,m318,CHARLIE,Except sex.
165883,L157436,u4783,m318,MEEKS,All right.  I'll try anything once.
165884,L157320,u4783,m318,MEEKS,How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.

165993,L157238,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?"
165994,L157237,u4776,m318,CHARLIE,"Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group."
165995,L157236,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead."

166008,L157357,u4777,m318,CHET,Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
166009,L157347,u4777,m318,CHET,"It's not all right.  Come on, Dad"
166010,L157346,u4778,m318,CHRIS,"It's all right, Chet."
166011,L158005,u4782,m318,KNOX,It's just for a little while. You promised.
166012,L158004,u4778,m318,CHRIS,I have to go home. Chet might call.
166013,L157986,u4782,m318,KNOX,My Word
166014,L157985,u4778,m318,CHRIS,What is that?
166015,L157984,u4782,m318,KNOX,Dead Poets honor.
166016,L157983,u4778,m318,CHRIS,"Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-"
166017,L157982,u4782,m318,KNOX,Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
166018,L157981,u4778,m318,CHRIS,"God, if Chet found out he'd..."
166019,L157980,u4782,m318,KNOX,"I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out."
166020,L157979,u4778,m318,CHRIS,Uh-huh.
166021,L157978,u4782,m318,KNOX,"Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever."

166023,L157976,u4782,m318,KNOX,Then come with me.
166024,L157975,u4778,m318,CHRIS,Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
166025,L157974,u4782,m318,KNOX,Are you going with Chet?
166026,L157973,u4778,m318,CHRIS,"Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play."
166027,L157972,u4782,m318,KNOX,Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
166028,L157971,u4778,m318,CHRIS,And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
166029,L157970,u4782,m318,KNOX,Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
166030,L157969,u4778,m318,CHRIS,Just like that?!  You just knew?
166031,L157968,u4782,m318,KNOX,"Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul."
166032,L157966,u4778,m318,CHRIS,You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
166033,L157965,u4782,m318,KNOX,But I love you.
166034,L157964,u4778,m318,CHRIS,"Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox."
166035,L157963,u4782,m318,KNOX,I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
166036,L157962,u4778,m318,CHRIS,"Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?"
166037,L157961,u4782,m318,KNOX,"If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble."
166038,L157960,u4782,m318,KNOX,You can't be in here.
166039,L157959,u4778,m318,CHRIS,"Knox, why are you doing this to me?"

166072,L157869,u4782,m318,KNOX,"They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind."
166073,L157868,u4780,m318,HAGER,"What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?"
166074,L157867,u4782,m318,KNOX,"We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir."

166076,L158006,u4781,m318,KEATING,We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
166077,L157833,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:"
166078,L157832,u4783,m318,MEEKS,"Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?"
166079,L157557,u4783,m318,MEEKS,"Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?"
166080,L157556,u4781,m318,KEATING,"And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal."
166081,L157385,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say ""the hoi polloi"" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are ""hoi polloi."""
166082,L157384,u4783,m318,MEEKS,The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
166083,L157310,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?"
166084,L157309,u4783,m318,MEEKS,Meeks.
166085,L157308,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Very good, Mr._?"
166086,L157307,u4783,m318,MEEKS,Carpe Diem... seize the day.
166087,L157306,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is ""Carpe Diem."" Anyone know what that means?"
166088,L157814,u4786,m318,NOLAN,"At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself."
166089,L157813,u4781,m318,KEATING,I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
166090,L157812,u4786,m318,NOLAN,"John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?"
166091,L157811,u4781,m318,KEATING,Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
166092,L157810,u4786,m318,NOLAN,Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
166093,L157809,u4781,m318,KEATING,Courtyard?
166094,L157808,u4786,m318,NOLAN,What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
166095,L157807,u4781,m318,KEATING,Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
166096,L157806,u4786,m318,NOLAN,"English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable."
166097,L157805,u4781,m318,KEATING,I didn't know you taught.
166098,L157804,u4786,m318,NOLAN,"This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk."
166099,L158009,u4788,m318,TODD,I have something.
166100,L158008,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Come on boys, don't be shy."
166101,L157589,u4788,m318,TODD,"From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!"
166102,L157588,u4781,m318,KEATING,Don't stop!
166103,L157587,u4788,m318,TODD,"Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-"
166104,L157585,u4788,m318,TODD,His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
166105,L157584,u4781,m318,KEATING,Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
166106,L157583,u4788,m318,TODD,A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
166107,L157582,u4781,m318,KEATING,A sweaty-toothed madman
166108,L157581,u4788,m318,TODD,I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
166109,L157580,u4781,m318,KEATING,Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
166110,L157579,u4788,m318,TODD,A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
166111,L157578,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!"
166112,L157577,u4788,m318,TODD,A crazy madman.
166113,L157576,u4781,m318,KEATING,A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
166114,L157575,u4788,m318,TODD,A madman.
166115,L157574,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it."
166116,L157573,u4781,m318,KEATING,All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!
166117,L157572,u4788,m318,TODD,AHHHHHH!
166118,L157571,u4781,m318,KEATING,LOUDER!
166119,L157570,u4788,m318,TODD,YAWP!
166120,L157569,u4781,m318,KEATING,Again!  Louder!
166121,L157568,u4788,m318,TODD,Yawp!
166122,L157567,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Good god, boy! Yell!"
166123,L157566,u4781,m318,KEATING,A barbaric yawp.
166124,L157565,u4788,m318,TODD,A yawp?
166125,L157948,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up."
166126,L157947,u4781,m318,KEATING,Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
166127,L157946,u4785,m318,NEIL,Yeah.
166128,L157945,u4781,m318,KEATING,What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
166129,L157914,u4781,m318,KEATING,Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
166130,L157913,u4785,m318,NEIL,Isn't there an easier way?
166131,L157912,u4781,m318,KEATING,Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
166132,L157911,u4785,m318,NEIL,Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
166133,L157910,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want."
166134,L157909,u4785,m318,NEIL,"I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind ""for my own good."""
166135,L157908,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance."
166136,L157907,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one."
166137,L157906,u4785,m318,NEIL,Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
166138,L157905,u4781,m318,KEATING,"You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?"
166139,L157904,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!"
166140,L157903,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?"
166141,L157902,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?"
166142,L157901,u4781,m318,KEATING,Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
166143,L157900,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?"
166144,L157893,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone."
166145,L157892,u4781,m318,KEATING,Okay.
166146,L157891,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something."
166147,L157414,u4781,m318,KEATING,"All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead."
166148,L157413,u4785,m318,NEIL,What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
166149,L157407,u4781,m318,KEATING,Nothing wrong with research.
166150,L157406,u4785,m318,NEIL,I was just looking in an old annual and...
166151,L157405,u4781,m318,KEATING,"Ah, so you boy's have been snooping."
166152,L157404,u4785,m318,NEIL,Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
166153,L157941,u4782,m318,KNOX,I don't know.
166154,L157940,u4787,m318,PITTS,All right!  What'd she say?
166155,L157923,u4787,m318,PITTS,"Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?"
166156,L157922,u4782,m318,KNOX,"She won't even see me, Pitts."
166157,L157921,u4787,m318,PITTS,Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
166158,L157920,u4782,m318,KNOX,Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
166159,L157376,u4787,m318,PITTS,You have another choice.
166160,L157375,u4782,m318,KNOX,You really think I should forget her?
166161,L157371,u4782,m318,KNOX,"I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!"
166162,L157370,u4787,m318,PITTS,"All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve."
166163,L157369,u4782,m318,KNOX,It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
166164,L157368,u4787,m318,PITTS,Too bad.
166165,L157603,u4782,m318,KNOX,I'm calling her!
166166,L157602,u4785,m318,NEIL,Where are you going?
166167,L157515,u4782,m318,KNOX,But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
166168,L157514,u4785,m318,NEIL,You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
166169,L157367,u4782,m318,KNOX,She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
166170,L157366,u4785,m318,NEIL,Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
166171,L157326,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat."
166172,L157325,u4782,m318,KNOX,They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
166173,L157278,u4785,m318,NEIL,What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
166174,L157277,u4782,m318,KNOX,"All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?"
166175,L157274,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak."
166176,L157273,u4782,m318,KNOX,Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
166177,L157525,u4783,m318,MEEKS,Good luck.
166178,L157524,u4785,m318,NEIL,I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
166179,L157469,u4785,m318,NEIL,"God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode."
166180,L157468,u4783,m318,MEEKS,"If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them."
166181,L157433,u4785,m318,NEIL,Then you can help him.
166182,L157432,u4783,m318,MEEKS,"His grades are hurting, Charlie."
166183,L157397,u4785,m318,NEIL,Nothing.  No mention of it.
166184,L157396,u4783,m318,MEEKS,Any group pictures in the annual?
166185,L157280,u4785,m318,NEIL,Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
166186,L157279,u4783,m318,MEEKS,I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
166187,L157861,u4785,m318,NEIL,Yes sir.
166188,L157860,u4784,m318,MR. PERRY,"I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!"
166189,L157859,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please."
166190,L157858,u4784,m318,MR. PERRY,"Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  ""My niece is in a play with your son,"" Mrs. Marks says.  ""You must be mistaken,"" I say.  ""My son isn't in a play.""  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting."
166191,L157857,u4785,m318,NEIL,Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
166192,L157856,u4784,m318,MR. PERRY,Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
166193,L157855,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Father, I--"
166194,L157854,u4784,m318,MR. PERRY,"Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately."
166195,L157853,u4785,m318,NEIL,Father!
166196,L157269,u4784,m318,MR. PERRY,Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
166197,L157268,u4785,m318,NEIL,"You know me, always taking on too much."
166198,L157267,u4785,m318,NEIL,Yes sir.
166199,L157266,u4784,m318,MR. PERRY,"You know what this means to your mother, don't you?"
166200,L157265,u4785,m318,NEIL,Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
166201,L157264,u4784,m318,MR. PERRY,"When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me."
166202,L157263,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Father, I wasn't disputing you."
166203,L157262,u4784,m318,MR. PERRY,"I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?"
166204,L157261,u4784,m318,MR. PERRY,"Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?"
166205,L157260,u4785,m318,NEIL,"But father, it's not fair."
166206,L157259,u4784,m318,MR. PERRY,"I'm sorry, Neil."
166207,L157258,u4785,m318,NEIL,"But father, I'm assistant editor."
166208,L157593,u4785,m318,NEIL,The god of the cave.
166209,L157592,u4787,m318,PITTS,What is it?
166210,L157591,u4785,m318,NEIL,Look at this.
166211,L157435,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?"
166212,L157434,u4787,m318,PITTS,"What is this, a midnight study group?"
166213,L157421,u4787,m318,PITTS,That's miles.
166214,L157420,u4785,m318,NEIL,Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
166215,L157419,u4787,m318,PITTS,Where is this cave he's talking about?
166216,L157418,u4785,m318,NEIL,I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
166217,L157316,u4785,m318,NEIL,But different.
166218,L157315,u4787,m318,PITTS,Weird.
166219,L157875,u4785,m318,NEIL,I don't know.
166220,L157874,u4788,m318,TODD,Do you have to quit the play?
166221,L157873,u4785,m318,NEIL,Visit from my father.
166222,L157852,u4785,m318,NEIL,"That's it!  ""Follow my voice.  We'll try no manhood here.""  See you at dinner."
166223,L157851,u4788,m318,TODD,"YEA, ART THOU THERE?!"
166224,L157850,u4785,m318,NEIL,Put more into it!
166225,L157849,u4788,m318,TODD,"Yea, art thou there?"
166226,L157848,u4785,m318,NEIL,Chicken shit.  Where were we?
166227,L157847,u4788,m318,TODD,I'll come to the performance.
166228,L157846,u4785,m318,NEIL,Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
166229,L157845,u4788,m318,TODD,No thanks.
166230,L157844,u4785,m318,NEIL,You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
166231,L157842,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives."
166232,L157841,u4788,m318,TODD,This play?
166233,L157840,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!"
166234,L157839,u4788,m318,TODD,I will be with thee straight.
166235,L157838,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?"
166236,L157642,u4788,m318,TODD,Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
166237,L157641,u4785,m318,NEIL,"I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!"
166238,L157640,u4788,m318,TODD,what?
166239,L157639,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set."
166240,L157638,u4788,m318,TODD,"Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one."
166241,L157637,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought..."
166242,L157636,u4788,m318,TODD,Oh.
166243,L157635,u4785,m318,NEIL,Oh..
166244,L157634,u4788,m318,TODD,They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
166245,L157633,u4785,m318,NEIL,This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
166246,L157632,u4785,m318,NEIL,It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
166247,L157631,u4788,m318,TODD,It's my birthday.
166248,L157630,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Todd, what's the matter?"
166249,L157552,u4785,m318,NEIL,Quiet.  I have to think.
166250,L157551,u4788,m318,TODD,"Neil, you're not gonna..."
166251,L157550,u4785,m318,NEIL,From my father and Nolan.
166252,L157549,u4788,m318,TODD,From you?
166253,L157548,u4785,m318,NEIL,Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
166254,L157547,u4788,m318,TODD,"Neil, how are you gonna do this?"
166255,L157512,u4785,m318,NEIL,No.
166256,L157511,u4788,m318,TODD,No?  What do you mean 'no'?
166257,L157510,u4785,m318,NEIL,Er  No.
166258,L157509,u4788,m318,TODD,"No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?"
166259,L157508,u4785,m318,NEIL,Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
166260,L157507,u4788,m318,TODD,"Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that."
166261,L157506,u4785,m318,NEIL,"No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in."
166262,L157505,u4788,m318,TODD,You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
166263,L157504,u4785,m318,NEIL,Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
166264,L157503,u4788,m318,TODD,What is that supposed to mean?
166265,L157502,u4785,m318,NEIL,"None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?"
166266,L157501,u4788,m318,TODD,I guess.
166267,L157500,u4785,m318,NEIL,"By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?"
166268,L157499,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?"
166269,L157498,u4788,m318,TODD,But if he said no before then...
166270,L157497,u4785,m318,NEIL,"That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him."
166271,L157496,u4788,m318,TODD,Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
166272,L157495,u4785,m318,NEIL,Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
166273,L157494,u4788,m318,TODD,"Come on, that's impossible."
166274,L157493,u4785,m318,NEIL,"As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it."
166275,L157492,u4788,m318,TODD,Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
166276,L157491,u4785,m318,NEIL,"First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that."
166277,L157490,u4788,m318,TODD,"Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?"
166278,L157489,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!"
166279,L157488,u4788,m318,TODD,And now he will?
166280,L157487,u4785,m318,NEIL,So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
166281,L157486,u4788,m318,TODD,So?
166282,L157485,u4785,m318,NEIL,"They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs."
166283,L157484,u4788,m318,TODD,I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
166284,L157483,u4785,m318,NEIL,"A play, dummy."
166285,L157482,u4788,m318,TODD,A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
166286,L157481,u4785,m318,NEIL,What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
166287,L157480,u4788,m318,TODD,Found what?
166288,L157479,u4785,m318,NEIL,I've found it.
166289,L157455,u4785,m318,NEIL,"God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?"
166290,L157454,u4788,m318,TODD,Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
166291,L157453,u4785,m318,NEIL,What?
166292,L157452,u4788,m318,TODD,I don't want to read.
166293,L157451,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me."
166294,L157450,u4788,m318,TODD,Yes.  But
166295,L157449,u4785,m318,NEIL,But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
166296,L157448,u4788,m318,TODD,I... I just don't want to come.
166297,L157447,u4785,m318,NEIL,What is it then?
166298,L157329,u4788,m318,TODD,Thanks but  I'd better do history.
166299,L157328,u4785,m318,NEIL,Want to come to the study group?
166300,L157290,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?"
166301,L157289,u4788,m318,TODD,Nothing.
166302,L157288,u4785,m318,NEIL,What?
166303,L157287,u4788,m318,TODD,I'll take him over mine.
166304,L157286,u4785,m318,NEIL,So what do you think of my father?
166305,L157232,u4788,m318,TODD,I don't.
166306,L157231,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here."
166307,L157230,u4788,m318,TODD,My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
166308,L157229,u4785,m318,NEIL,"Oh, so you're that Anderson."
166309,L157228,u4788,m318,TODD,My brother went here.
166310,L157227,u4785,m318,NEIL,Why'd you leave Balincrest?
166311,L157226,u4788,m318,TODD,Todd Anderson.
166312,L157225,u4785,m318,NEIL,I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
166313,L159997,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves."
166314,L159996,u4789,m319,CAPTAIN,They are...they are everywhere.
166315,L159993,u4789,m319,CAPTAIN,We're going to die here! We're going to die!
166316,L159992,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,It's not going to help us!
166317,L159977,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Why don't you want a message sent?
166318,L159976,u4789,m319,CAPTAIN,He's the owner...
166319,L159975,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Who are you?
166320,L159960,u4789,m319,CAPTAIN,We have to make it to the third deck...
166321,L159959,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,How do we get out of here?
166322,L159958,u4789,m319,CAPTAIN,Yes.
166323,L159957,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,You the Captain?
166324,L160110,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
166325,L160109,u4792,m319,MAMOOLI,And what? These things are octopusses?
166326,L160108,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
166327,L160107,u4792,m319,MAMOOLI,What the hell are you talking about?
166328,L160106,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish."
166329,L160105,u4792,m319,MAMOOLI,I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
166330,L160104,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!"
166331,L160101,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Boat or no boat...I'm going...
166332,L160100,u4792,m319,MAMOOLI,We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
166333,L160097,u4792,m319,MAMOOLI,Someone...maybe they sent an SOS!
166334,L160096,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Who?
166335,L160124,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
166336,L160123,u4791,m319,HANOVER,Maybe we lost them.
166337,L160059,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Just trying to get to my boat...
166338,L160058,u4791,m319,HANOVER,"You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?"
166339,L160057,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,That's where my boat's moored.
166340,L160056,u4791,m319,HANOVER,Who gives a shit about aft?
166341,L159943,u4791,m319,HANOVER,With who?
166342,L159942,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Did you clear this?
166343,L159941,u4791,m319,HANOVER,"Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job..."
166344,L159938,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I told you...
166345,L159937,u4791,m319,HANOVER,"Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo?"
166346,L159936,u4791,m319,HANOVER,Shut up!
166347,L159935,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"Hanover, listen..."
166348,L159928,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Dead.
166349,L159927,u4791,m319,HANOVER,Where are my men?
166350,L159793,u4791,m319,HANOVER,I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
166351,L159792,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
166352,L159791,u4791,m319,HANOVER,And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
166353,L159790,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
166354,L159775,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Then you better start swimming.
166355,L159774,u4791,m319,HANOVER,Not an option.
166356,L159773,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,You're going to have to get a new one.
166357,L159772,u4791,m319,HANOVER,We were talking about my schedule...
166358,L159769,u4791,m319,HANOVER,I have a schedule...
166359,L159768,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly."
166360,L159767,u4791,m319,HANOVER,How soon can we get up and running?
166361,L159766,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
166362,L159723,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion."
166363,L159722,u4791,m319,HANOVER,He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
166364,L159721,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Who asked any?
166365,L159720,u4791,m319,HANOVER,And no questions asked.
166366,L159719,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
166367,L159718,u4791,m319,HANOVER,This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
166368,L159670,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
166369,L159669,u4791,m319,HANOVER,Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
166370,L159665,u4791,m319,HANOVER,Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
166371,L159664,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
166372,L159663,u4791,m319,HANOVER,Which question is that?
166373,L159662,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
166374,L159661,u4791,m319,HANOVER,And where is our point of arrival?
166375,L159660,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Right here...middle of nowhere...
166376,L159658,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
166377,L159657,u4791,m319,HANOVER,"No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box."
166378,L159656,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
166379,L159655,u4791,m319,HANOVER,You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
166380,L160248,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,He's not coming...
166381,L160247,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Where's you friend?
166382,L160244,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"This time, make an exception."
166383,L160243,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,I don't take orders at all.
166384,L160242,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"You don't take orders very well, do you?"
166385,L160241,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,No...
166386,L160240,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
166387,L160239,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Soon as I get over the heart attack...
166388,L160238,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
166389,L160201,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,And what if I run into one of those things?
166390,L160200,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
166391,L160199,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,You want ME to go up there?
166392,L160196,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Right...
166393,L160195,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,"How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?"
166394,L160186,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Jet ski...there's one left up there.
166395,L160185,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,"If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?"
166396,L160184,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy..."
166397,L160181,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,"...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?"
166398,L160180,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Yeah...
166399,L160179,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Finnegan...
166400,L160172,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Not like him.
166401,L160171,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
166402,L160160,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
166403,L160159,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,What?
166404,L160158,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,It's not them...it's it...
166405,L160151,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Keep tasting...
166406,L160150,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,"I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand..."
166407,L160143,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living..."
166408,L160142,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
166409,L160138,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,You should talk...
166410,L160137,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Looking good...
166411,L160127,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,We can't just leave them here.
166412,L160126,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,A meat locker.
166413,L160125,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,What is it?
166414,L160122,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,The quiet...
166415,L160121,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,What's the matter?
166416,L160119,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I'm saying they're calling the shots...
166417,L160118,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,You're saying they can think?
166418,L160117,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Like cattle...
166419,L160041,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Takes one to know one.
166420,L160040,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,How do you know that?
166421,L160039,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"The ""come back"" kind."
166422,L160038,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Oh yeah? What kind is that?
166423,L160037,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
166424,L160036,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Right... You have a boat.
166425,L160035,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Yeah you did...
166426,L160034,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Hey! I didn't have to come back.
166427,L160033,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Got it?
166428,L160030,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,On the side!!
166429,L160029,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,I don't know where it is!
166430,L160026,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Takes one to know one.
166431,L160025,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?"
166432,L160024,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Self sufficient...
166433,L160023,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Anti social?
166434,L160022,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,"Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one..."
166435,L160021,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Quite a few.
166436,L160020,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Seen a lot of islands?
166437,L160019,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,That's what I do.
166438,L160018,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
166439,L160013,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,"Thank you, I work at it..."
166440,L160012,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"Well, you sure do a good imitation."
166441,L160011,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,I'm not rich people.
166442,L160010,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,You people...rich people...
166443,L160009,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,What's that supposed to mean? You people.
166444,L160008,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way..."
166445,L160007,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,You don't have to be so touchy.
166446,L160006,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't..."
166447,L160005,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
166448,L160004,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
166449,L160003,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
166450,L160002,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I don't know...
166451,L160001,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,What are those things?
166452,L160000,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Jesus Christ lady...
166453,L159999,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Noooo!
166454,L159995,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,You hear that?
166455,L159994,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
166456,L159988,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,He's with them.
166457,L159987,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,What are you people talking about?
166458,L159986,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Unless you collected on the insurance...
166459,L159922,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I'm their ride.
166460,L159921,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Then who are you?
166461,L159920,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I'm not a thief.
166462,L159919,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,The thieves.
166463,L159918,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,What other bunch?
166464,L159915,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Who asked you to!
166465,L159914,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I saved your life is what I did!
166466,L159913,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,Now look what you did!
166467,L159910,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,It ain't any better out there!
166468,L159909,u4795,m319,TRILLIAN,I'm not staying here!
166469,L159891,u4793,m319,MULLIGAN,"Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!"
166470,L159890,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
166471,L159889,u4793,m319,MULLIGAN,Shut up! You hear me!!
166472,L159888,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Forget them...
166473,L159887,u4793,m319,MULLIGAN,Hanover!! Hanover!!
166474,L159845,u4793,m319,MULLIGAN,Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
166475,L159844,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
166476,L159843,u4793,m319,MULLIGAN,So?
166477,L159842,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
166478,L159808,u4793,m319,MULLIGAN,You ain't giving the orders here!
166479,L159807,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Let's just keep going.
166480,L160260,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,"Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again..."
166481,L160259,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Joey...
166482,L160258,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,"Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach..."
166483,L160257,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Joey...
166484,L160256,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
166485,L160221,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?"
166486,L160220,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
166487,L160219,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
166488,L160218,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,She's gone...
166489,L160217,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,One whistle... Start the engine...
166490,L160216,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,"Man, don't go up there..."
166491,L160214,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,How does an island sound to you?
166492,L160213,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,And what have you come up with?
166493,L160212,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,I have been.
166494,L160211,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,"I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought."
166495,L160210,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"Line it up now, nice and easy..."
166496,L160209,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
166497,L160208,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,A little to the left...
166498,L160207,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
166499,L160205,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
166500,L160204,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
166501,L160198,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
166502,L160197,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
166503,L160194,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,"For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast."
166504,L160193,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?"
166505,L160192,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
166506,L160191,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?"
166507,L160190,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,"Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?"
166508,L160189,u4790,m319,FINNEGAN,"Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red..."
166509,L160188,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
166510,L160055,u4794,m319,PANTUCCI,That way.

167070,L160862,u4812,m320,VINCE,"And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?"
167071,L160861,u4808,m320,NICK,Yeah.
167072,L160860,u4812,m320,VINCE,You're full of shit!
167073,L160859,u4808,m320,NICK,"They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them ""chomp chomps"", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths."
167074,L160858,u4812,m320,VINCE,Six or eight.  And they go wild?
167075,L160857,u4808,m320,NICK,"One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun."
167076,L160856,u4812,m320,VINCE,"Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!"
167077,L160855,u4808,m320,NICK,Never one.
167078,L160854,u4812,m320,VINCE,No!
167079,L160853,u4808,m320,NICK,No.
167080,L160852,u4812,m320,VINCE,"Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?"
167081,L160851,u4808,m320,NICK,Naw.  Uh-huh.
167082,L160850,u4812,m320,VINCE,"I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --"
167083,L160849,u4808,m320,NICK,Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
167084,L160848,u4812,m320,VINCE,"How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?"
167085,L160786,u4812,m320,VINCE,What's it for??
167086,L160785,u4808,m320,NICK,What the hell's that for?
167087,L160783,u4808,m320,NICK,"Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I mean... Great! That's really great!"
167088,L160782,u4812,m320,VINCE,That's who.
167089,L160781,u4808,m320,NICK,Cynthia! Sure.
167090,L160778,u4812,m320,VINCE,"Aw, it's a long story!"
167091,L160777,u4808,m320,NICK,"Well, who'd you get married to?"
167092,L160772,u4812,m320,VINCE,"Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat."
167093,L160771,u4808,m320,NICK,"How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?"
167094,L160289,u4808,m320,NICK,"It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you."
167095,L160288,u4812,m320,VINCE,He's getting married... and we're nuts!
167096,L161096,u4811,m320,VET 2,Up.
167097,L161095,u4810,m320,VET 1,Up a little there... What would you say?
167098,L160304,u4811,m320,VET 2,Down ribbon!
167099,L160303,u4810,m320,VET 1,Down.
167100,L160302,u4811,m320,VET 2,Down I would say... What would you say?
167101,L160301,u4810,m320,VET 1,Up ribbon!
167102,L160300,u4811,m320,VET 2,Up.
167103,L160299,u4810,m320,VET 1,Up I would say... What would you say?
167104,L161698,u4813,m321,BENNETT,Wade did a little reminiscing.
167105,L161697,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
167106,L161292,u4813,m321,BENNETT,Wade's here.
167107,L161291,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Yeah?
167108,L161220,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,I want this bastard brought down.
167109,L161219,u4813,m321,BENNETT,"Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?"
167110,L161218,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
167111,L161217,u4813,m321,BENNETT,Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
167112,L161216,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,That's him.  Simon Doucet.
167113,L161206,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,I can smell it.
167114,L161205,u4813,m321,BENNETT,No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
167115,L161204,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Technothugs?
167116,L161203,u4813,m321,BENNETT,Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
167117,L161202,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,"What'cha got, Bennett?"
167118,L161201,u4813,m321,BENNETT,"Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city."
167119,L161695,u4817,m321,KIMBERLY,"Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language."
167120,L161694,u4814,m321,CASSY,Kimberly!
167121,L161693,u4817,m321,KIMBERLY,I think he wants more than your cookies.
167122,L161692,u4814,m321,CASSY,He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
167123,L161691,u4817,m321,KIMBERLY,Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
167124,L161690,u4817,m321,KIMBERLY,I'd think about it.
167125,L161689,u4814,m321,CASSY,What did you say?
167126,L161688,u4817,m321,KIMBERLY,Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
167127,L161892,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Put that on your political resume.
167128,L161891,u4815,m321,DUBBS,It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
167129,L161856,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
167130,L161855,u4815,m321,DUBBS,I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
167131,L161854,u4815,m321,DUBBS,It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
167132,L161853,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Speak up.
167133,L161846,u4815,m321,DUBBS,Your mother.
167134,L161845,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it."
167135,L161844,u4815,m321,DUBBS,Fuck you - fuck you.
167136,L161843,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Funny guy.
167137,L161842,u4815,m321,DUBBS,"No, you're not model material.  Anything else?"
167138,L161841,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,I want to ask you a few questions.
167139,L161840,u4815,m321,DUBBS,Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
167140,L161839,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,My man Dubbs.
167141,L161838,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Avon Lady!
167142,L161837,u4815,m321,DUBBS,Who is it?
167143,L161888,u4821,m321,WADE,You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
167144,L161887,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,I don't want to hear anymore.
167145,L161886,u4821,m321,WADE,<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
167146,L161885,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,You're crazy.
167147,L161884,u4821,m321,WADE,You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
167148,L161883,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,What are you talking about?
167149,L161882,u4821,m321,WADE,"That wasn't your plan, was it?"
167150,L161881,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
167151,L161880,u4821,m321,WADE,We have to talk.
167152,L161879,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,What is it?  I'm about to go on.
167153,L161774,u4821,m321,WADE,Not anymore.
167154,L161773,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
167155,L161772,u4821,m321,WADE,I'm wasting time.
167156,L161768,u4821,m321,WADE,Where?
167157,L161767,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
167158,L161598,u4821,m321,WADE,"Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?"
167159,L161597,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
167160,L161596,u4821,m321,WADE,Remember my promise.
167161,L161595,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,"This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right."
167162,L161591,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,And I want Doucet.
167163,L161590,u4821,m321,WADE,I want to stop aging.
167164,L161589,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,"Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom."
167165,L161588,u4821,m321,WADE,I'm not voting for you.
167166,L161587,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
167167,L161585,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,I'll be alright.
167168,L161584,u4821,m321,WADE,Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
167169,L161583,u4821,m321,WADE,Out of the room.
167170,L161582,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Hello Wade.
167171,L161326,u4821,m321,WADE,I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
167172,L161325,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,You're working a partner on this.
167173,L161324,u4821,m321,WADE,I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
167174,L161323,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,"The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be."
167175,L161318,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,When you bring in Doucet.
167176,L161317,u4821,m321,WADE,Give it to me.
167177,L161316,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
167178,L161315,u4821,m321,WADE,You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
167179,L161314,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,"No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful."
167180,L161313,u4821,m321,WADE,He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
167181,L161312,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,"Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children."
167182,L161311,u4821,m321,WADE,I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
167183,L161310,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Mug sheets.
167184,L161309,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
167185,L161308,u4821,m321,WADE,What's this?
167186,L161306,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,"I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted."
167187,L161305,u4821,m321,WADE,"I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'."
167188,L161304,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Later.  I want Doucet first.
167189,L161303,u4821,m321,WADE,I want to see my wife and kid.
167190,L161302,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,"Well, you've just been taken off the bench."
167191,L161301,u4821,m321,WADE,I'm not on the force anymore.
167192,L161300,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,"Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops."
167193,L161299,u4821,m321,WADE,I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
167194,L161298,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,"Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest."
167195,L161297,u4821,m321,WADE,"Shucks, and I got all dressed up."
167196,L161296,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
167197,L161295,u4821,m321,WADE,Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
167198,L161890,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
167199,L161889,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
167200,L161412,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,What the hell are you talking about?
167201,L161411,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Sir, your transmission's fading."
167202,L161408,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,I'm thrilled beyond belief.
167203,L161407,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages."
167204,L161406,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,You two fucks listen up.  Doucet's killing people and you're wasting valuable time busting two-bit Technothugs.
167205,L161374,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Forget it.  Stick to the program.
167206,L161373,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"We seem to've come across a 211, sir."
167207,L161372,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
167208,L161237,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
167209,L161236,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Kill him... kill him.
167210,L161233,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,He could be brought back.
167211,L161232,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
167212,L161230,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
167213,L161229,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
167214,L161162,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
167215,L161161,u4822,m321,WARDEN,NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
167216,L161160,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Just great.
167217,L161159,u4822,m321,WARDEN,Telephone repairman.
167218,L161158,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
167219,L161157,u4822,m321,WARDEN,It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
167220,L161156,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
167221,L161894,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Shut up!  Drop it.
167222,L161893,u4818,m321,PEEBLES,Sir---
167223,L161615,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Keep 'em busy.
167224,L161614,u4818,m321,PEEBLES,"Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go."
167225,L161601,u4818,m321,PEEBLES,Aces.
167226,L161600,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,How do I look?
167227,L161599,u4818,m321,PEEBLES,You okay?
167228,L161594,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
167229,L161593,u4818,m321,PEEBLES,"Sir, your limo's here."
167230,L161578,u4818,m321,PEEBLES,I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
167231,L161577,u4816,m321,GALLAGHER,Fine.
167232,L161576,u4818,m321,PEEBLES,"Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready."
167233,L161668,u4817,m321,KIMBERLY,"Ooops, I forgot."
167234,L161667,u4824,m321,WILLY,Not the 'T' word.
167235,L161666,u4817,m321,KIMBERLY,Maybe I should put on the training whe---
167236,L161665,u4824,m321,WILLY,Go in the house.
167237,L161664,u4817,m321,KIMBERLY,Nobody's looking.
167238,L161663,u4824,m321,WILLY,"Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me."
167239,L161662,u4817,m321,KIMBERLY,You sure?  I can help you.
167240,L161661,u4824,m321,WILLY,I got it.  I got it.
167241,L161660,u4817,m321,KIMBERLY,Need help?
167242,L161864,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,And you should be with your family.
167243,L161863,u4821,m321,WADE,You should be in hospital.
167244,L161783,u4821,m321,WADE,No you don't.
167245,L161782,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,No.  I want to be with you.
167246,L161781,u4821,m321,WADE,I'm signing off.
167247,L161780,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,You be careful.
167248,L161779,u4821,m321,WADE,"He's got my grandson, Sanchez."
167249,L161778,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,I just heard.
167250,L161736,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"If you were set up, I want to find out who did it."
167251,L161735,u4821,m321,WADE,"What are you doing this for, Sanchez?"
167252,L161729,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Hospital food.
167253,L161728,u4821,m321,WADE,What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
167254,L161727,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
167255,L161726,u4821,m321,WADE,You okay?
167256,L161725,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
167257,L161724,u4821,m321,WADE,"So, he's got a thing for prison clothes."
167258,L161723,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
167259,L161722,u4821,m321,WADE,Yeah.
167260,L161658,u4821,m321,WADE,Not yet.
167261,L161657,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,...Have you been drinking?
167262,L161656,u4821,m321,WADE,Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
167263,L161655,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,...What are you talking about...?
167264,L161654,u4821,m321,WADE,You treat her nice.
167265,L161653,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,I'm here.
167266,L161652,u4821,m321,WADE,Sanchez...?
167267,L161632,u4821,m321,WADE,"We're partners, aren't we?"
167268,L161631,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,What's this?
167269,L161629,u4821,m321,WADE,Not too good.
167270,L161628,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,How do I look?
167271,L161627,u4821,m321,WADE,How ya feeling?
167272,L161626,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Rip Van Winkle.
167273,L161541,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
167274,L161540,u4821,m321,WADE,Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
167275,L161538,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Simulated one.
167276,L161537,u4821,m321,WADE,"Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?"
167277,L161525,u4821,m321,WADE,Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
167278,L161524,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Wallet, cash, I.D..."
167279,L161523,u4821,m321,WADE,What else did he get?
167280,L161522,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
167281,L161518,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"No, sir."
167282,L161517,u4821,m321,WADE,"You're not pregnant, are you?"
167283,L161516,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy."
167284,L161515,u4821,m321,WADE,Wanna try?
167285,L161508,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got."
167286,L161507,u4821,m321,WADE,With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
167287,L161506,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
167288,L161505,u4821,m321,WADE,Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
167289,L161504,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills."
167290,L161500,u4821,m321,WADE,Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
167291,L161499,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Maybe I should turn myself in.
167292,L161497,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,That cost me two weeks' pay.
167293,L161496,u4821,m321,WADE,Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
167294,L161493,u4821,m321,WADE,Then find me some cigarettes.
167295,L161492,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Yes, sir."
167296,L161491,u4821,m321,WADE,You want to be a good detective?
167297,L161490,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me."
167298,L161489,u4821,m321,WADE,"Hey, I'm eating."
167299,L161488,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
167300,L161487,u4821,m321,WADE,No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
167301,L161484,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
167302,L161483,u4821,m321,WADE,I'll have a cup of coffee?
167303,L161474,u4821,m321,WADE,Good night.
167304,L161473,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Good night, Wade."
167305,L161472,u4821,m321,WADE,I'll be okay.
167306,L161471,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,You need anything else?
167307,L161467,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Thanks.
167308,L161466,u4821,m321,WADE,She's pretty.
167309,L161465,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night."
167310,L161464,u4821,m321,WADE,Yeah.
167311,L161462,u4821,m321,WADE,This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
167312,L161461,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,What's this place?
167313,L161459,u4821,m321,WADE,Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
167314,L161458,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
167315,L161457,u4821,m321,WADE,Married?
167316,L161456,u4821,m321,WADE,Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
167317,L161455,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
167318,L161454,u4821,m321,WADE,"'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser."
167319,L161453,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
167320,L161452,u4821,m321,WADE,I was set up.
167321,L161451,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Why?
167322,L161450,u4821,m321,WADE,Drop it.
167323,L161449,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
167324,L161448,u4821,m321,WADE,GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
167325,L161447,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today..."
167326,L161446,u4821,m321,WADE,"You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane."
167327,L161445,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,How then?
167328,L161444,u4821,m321,WADE,You can't catch this man with a computer.
167329,L161443,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
167330,L161438,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Relax, let technology do the work."
167331,L161437,u4821,m321,WADE,"Hey, buddy..."
167332,L161435,u4821,m321,WADE,Trust me.  You don't want to know.
167333,L161434,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
167334,L161433,u4821,m321,WADE,Bacon cheeseburgers.
167335,L161432,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?"
167336,L161431,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"When you're frozen, you're legally dead, right?"
167337,L161430,u4821,m321,WADE,Yes.
167338,L161429,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Can I ask you something?
167339,L161428,u4821,m321,WADE,Pass.
167340,L161427,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
167341,L161378,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,My insurance won't cover it.
167342,L161377,u4821,m321,WADE,Wanna come?
167343,L161376,u4821,m321,WADE,I'm not fond of television comedies.
167344,L161375,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,You can't turn him off.  He's the Commissioner.
167345,L161368,u4821,m321,WADE,"Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do."
167346,L161367,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
167347,L161366,u4821,m321,WADE,There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
167348,L161365,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,I'll inform dispatch.
167349,L161364,u4821,m321,WADE,Some things never change.
167350,L161363,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,How do you know?
167351,L161362,u4821,m321,WADE,They're going to rob that bank.
167352,L161359,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Technothugs.
167353,L161358,u4821,m321,WADE,See those guys?
167354,L161355,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Doucet killed my partner.
167355,L161354,u4821,m321,WADE,"No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?"
167356,L161353,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
167357,L161352,u4821,m321,WADE,"I have to go home, Sanchez."
167358,L161350,u4821,m321,WADE,Lean year for role models.
167359,L161349,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir."
167360,L161348,u4821,m321,WADE,Got it.  Ejection seat?
167361,L161347,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
167362,L161346,u4821,m321,WADE,"Does it drive itself, too?"
167363,L161344,u4821,m321,WADE,"Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike."
167364,L161343,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,But Sergeant...
167365,L161342,u4821,m321,WADE,I'm ready.
167366,L161341,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
167367,L161340,u4821,m321,WADE,I drive.
167368,L161339,u4821,m321,WADE,"Well, that's good enough for me."
167369,L161338,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Yes.
167370,L161337,u4821,m321,WADE,Are you a cop?
167371,L161336,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,"Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---"
167372,L161335,u4821,m321,WADE,You my partner?
167373,L161190,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
167374,L161189,u4820,m321,SHEPPARD,They always are.
167375,L161188,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,But he was such a good cop.
167376,L161187,u4820,m321,SHEPPARD,He went dirty and they made an example of him.
167377,L161186,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,He had a partner.  Our own Ray Gallagher.  He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic.  Reckless.  Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
167378,L161185,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Take a look at this.
167379,L161184,u4820,m321,SHEPPARD,You never want to find out.
167380,L161183,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,What's it mean?
167381,L161182,u4820,m321,SHEPPARD,Demolition Man.
167382,L161181,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
167383,L161180,u4820,m321,SHEPPARD,You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
167384,L161179,u4819,m321,SANCHEZ,This is the guy that killed my partner.
167385,L161178,u4820,m321,SHEPPARD,"Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that."
167386,L161687,u4821,m321,WADE,"Remember, get the seat fixed."
167387,L161686,u4824,m321,WILLY,Bye.  Thanks.
167388,L161684,u4821,m321,WADE,"Good to know you, Willy."
167389,L161683,u4824,m321,WILLY,William Simpson.  I like Willy.
167390,L161682,u4821,m321,WADE,What's your name?
167391,L161681,u4824,m321,WILLY,I'm going to be a policeman.
167392,L161680,u4824,m321,WILLY,My granddad was a policeman.
167393,L161679,u4821,m321,WADE,Yes.
167394,L161677,u4824,m321,WILLY,My mom says I'm gonna grow.
167395,L161676,u4821,m321,WADE,Seat's too high.
167396,L161675,u4824,m321,WILLY,Yeah.
167397,L161674,u4821,m321,WADE,You all right?
167398,L161716,u4821,m321,WADE,I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
167399,L161715,u4823,m321,WHORE,Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
167400,L161714,u4821,m321,WADE,"It's stuck, but thanks for the offer."
167401,L161713,u4823,m321,WHORE,You could always take it off.
167402,L161712,u4821,m321,WADE,This little thing says I can't.
167403,L161711,u4823,m321,WHORE,Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
167404,L161709,u4823,m321,WHORE,"Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?"
167405,L161708,u4821,m321,WADE,Hi.
167406,L161707,u4823,m321,WHORE,Hi.
167407,L164865,u4825,m322,BELLE,They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
167408,L164864,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Who are these people?
167409,L164825,u4825,m322,BELLE,"They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --"
167410,L164824,u4828,m322,JABEZ,What are those people doing there? What do they want?
167411,L164752,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle."
167412,L164751,u4825,m322,BELLE,Jabez! Careful --
167413,L164750,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them."
167414,L164746,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?"
167415,L164745,u4825,m322,BELLE,"The people, Jabez -- the people."
167416,L164657,u4825,m322,BELLE,Of course I will.
167417,L164656,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle."
167418,L164643,u4825,m322,BELLE,We will --
167419,L164642,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning."
167420,L164631,u4825,m322,BELLE,"No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --"
167421,L164630,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Let's dance together -- Belle.
167422,L164620,u4825,m322,BELLE,No -- that's for me to do.
167423,L164619,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I'll take it.
167424,L164617,u4828,m322,JABEZ,From over the mountain --
167425,L164616,u4825,m322,BELLE,Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
167426,L164845,u4831,m322,MARY,"That's my problem, Belle."
167427,L164844,u4825,m322,BELLE,"You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way."
167428,L164843,u4831,m322,MARY,"I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive."
167429,L164842,u4825,m322,BELLE,You know that you're in my house.
167430,L164841,u4831,m322,MARY,Lying to you -- Why should I?
167431,L164840,u4825,m322,BELLE,You're lying.
167432,L164839,u4831,m322,MARY,I didn't.
167433,L164838,u4825,m322,BELLE,I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
167434,L164695,u4831,m322,MARY,He lied to me again.
167435,L164694,u4825,m322,BELLE,"That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?"
167436,L164626,u4831,m322,MARY,"Thank you, Belle --"
167437,L164625,u4825,m322,BELLE,Belle --
167438,L164624,u4831,m322,MARY,"No, thank you -- what's your name?"
167439,L164623,u4825,m322,BELLE,"You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?"
167440,L164622,u4825,m322,BELLE,"I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --"
167441,L164621,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez -- ?
167442,L164803,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone."
167443,L164802,u4826,m322,DANIEL,But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
167444,L164801,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains."
167445,L164800,u4826,m322,DANIEL,Anybody can see that.
167446,L164799,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
167447,L164798,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"What's that, sir?"
167448,L164797,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself."
167449,L164796,u4826,m322,DANIEL,Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
167450,L164795,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then."
167451,L164794,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"Make them go faster, Mr.... ?"
167452,L164793,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
167453,L164792,u4826,m322,DANIEL,Why? It don't hurt.
167454,L164791,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
167455,L164790,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,And serve him right!
167456,L164789,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"Well, I thought he'd come in the middle."
167457,L164788,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,And what about Daniel Webster?
167458,L164787,u4826,m322,DANIEL,I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
167459,L164786,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?"
167460,L164785,u4826,m322,DANIEL,'N Daniel Webster will be there.
167461,L164784,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Young man -- you got me there.
167462,L164783,u4826,m322,DANIEL,And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
167463,L164782,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Guess there will, if it says so."
167464,L164781,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?"
167465,L164780,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,It hasn't opened yet?
167466,L164779,u4826,m322,DANIEL,Gee -- that Fair --
167467,L164778,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"All right, Daniel. Jump in."
167468,L164777,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone."
167469,L164776,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?"
167470,L164956,u4831,m322,MARY,"All right, darling."
167471,L164955,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you."
167472,L164954,u4831,m322,MARY,Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
167473,L164953,u4826,m322,DANIEL,Mama!
167474,L164823,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party."
167475,L164822,u4831,m322,MARY,"Daniel, you ought to be in bed."
167476,L164690,u4831,m322,MARY,Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
167477,L164689,u4826,m322,DANIEL,No! No! I won't.
167478,L164688,u4831,m322,MARY,Daniel give me that beanshooter!
167479,L164687,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!"
167480,L164686,u4831,m322,MARY,"Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!"
167481,L164710,u4826,m322,DANIEL,Not me!
167482,L164709,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off."
167483,L164708,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"Grandma, look at me!"
167484,L164685,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"I did not, Grandma."
167485,L164684,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?"
167486,L164683,u4829,m322,MA STONE,That's just too bad --
167487,L164682,u4826,m322,DANIEL,But I like the new one better.
167488,L164681,u4829,m322,MA STONE,Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
167489,L164680,u4826,m322,DANIEL,"Granny, when do we move to the new house?"
167490,L164532,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ..."
167491,L164531,u4827,m322,HANK,Say ... about the interest ...
167492,L164529,u4827,m322,HANK,"Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ..."
167493,L164528,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you."
167494,L164527,u4827,m322,HANK,"Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez."
167495,L164526,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
167496,L164525,u4827,m322,HANK,"Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?"
167497,L164524,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
167498,L164523,u4827,m322,HANK,"Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?"
167499,L164522,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?"
167500,L164521,u4827,m322,HANK,Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
167501,L164520,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Howdy, Hank."
167502,L164519,u4827,m322,HANK,"Howdy, Jabez."
167503,L165032,u4838,m322,TOM SHARP,We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
167504,L165031,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could."
167505,L165030,u4838,m322,TOM SHARP,Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
167506,L164291,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
167507,L164290,u4838,m322,TOM SHARP,"Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good."
167508,L164287,u4838,m322,TOM SHARP,That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
167509,L164286,u4828,m322,JABEZ,What Grange?
167510,L164285,u4838,m322,TOM SHARP,"Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?"
167511,L164284,u4828,m322,JABEZ,What do you want?
167512,L164204,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Black Dan'l?
167513,L164203,u4838,m322,TOM SHARP,Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
167514,L164202,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
167515,L164201,u4838,m322,TOM SHARP,"That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so."
167516,L164200,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
167517,L164194,u4838,m322,TOM SHARP,"Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!"
167518,L164193,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Sure am.
167519,L164192,u4838,m322,TOM SHARP,Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
167520,L164191,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
167521,L164190,u4838,m322,TOM SHARP,Loan shark -- hey?
167522,L164615,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Belle --
167523,L164614,u4837,m322,THE WOMAN,Belle.
167524,L164613,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Never mind. What's your name?
167525,L164610,u4837,m322,THE WOMAN,But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
167526,L164609,u4828,m322,JABEZ,She couldn't be gone!
167527,L164608,u4837,m322,THE WOMAN,No. She's gone.
167528,L164607,u4828,m322,JABEZ,You're not -- Dorothy.
167529,L164863,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
167530,L164862,u4836,m322,STEVENS,I do -- and I think you should too.
167531,L164861,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?"
167532,L164860,u4836,m322,STEVENS,What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
167533,L164859,u4828,m322,JABEZ,All right -- so it's buried with you!
167534,L164858,u4836,m322,STEVENS,Don't say that -- I know it is --
167535,L164857,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
167536,L164856,u4836,m322,STEVENS,But what becomes of our souls?
167537,L164855,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all."
167538,L164854,u4836,m322,STEVENS,-- of what happens after we die!
167539,L164853,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Afraid ... of what?
167540,L164852,u4836,m322,STEVENS,You are afraid!
167541,L164851,u4828,m322,JABEZ,What's the matter with you?
167542,L164849,u4836,m322,STEVENS,Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
167543,L164848,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --"
167544,L164847,u4836,m322,STEVENS,"What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?"
167545,L164846,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Now run along, Daniel."
167546,L164832,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
167547,L164831,u4836,m322,STEVENS,Where's everybody?
167548,L164830,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"No, you're not."
167549,L164829,u4836,m322,STEVENS,"Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late."
167550,L164661,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Some other time, Stevens."
167551,L164660,u4836,m322,STEVENS,"Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone."
167552,L164659,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Hello, Stevens ... you're early today."
167553,L164658,u4836,m322,STEVENS,"Mornin', Jabez ..."
167554,L164339,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad...."
167555,L164338,u4836,m322,STEVENS,"Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property."
167556,L164337,u4828,m322,JABEZ,You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
167557,L164336,u4836,m322,STEVENS,I'd like to know where you'd get it....
167558,L164335,u4828,m322,JABEZ,-- in gold.
167559,L164334,u4836,m322,STEVENS,"No, Stone!"
167560,L164333,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
167561,L164332,u4836,m322,STEVENS,"Well, Stone -- have you got the money?"
167562,L164331,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Stevens!
167563,L164997,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Gentlemen, the prosecution rests."
167564,L164996,u4828,m322,JABEZ,You know darn well it is.
167565,L164995,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?"
167566,L164994,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me."
167567,L164991,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor."
167568,L164990,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie."
167569,L164989,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
167570,L164952,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Never!
167571,L164951,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
167572,L164950,u4828,m322,JABEZ,About what?
167573,L164949,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?"
167574,L164909,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed."
167575,L164908,u4828,m322,JABEZ,No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
167576,L164907,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ..."
167577,L164906,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
167578,L164905,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--"
167579,L164904,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
167580,L164903,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose."
167581,L164902,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
167582,L164901,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
167583,L164900,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I'm through with you.
167584,L164899,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?"
167585,L164898,u4828,m322,JABEZ,My time isn't up yet.
167586,L164897,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --"
167587,L164896,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Are they all as -- small -- as that?
167588,L164894,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,He was --
167589,L164893,u4828,m322,JABEZ,He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
167590,L164892,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,".... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance."
167591,L164888,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract."
167592,L164887,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --"
167593,L164886,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?"
167594,L164561,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that."
167595,L164560,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Leave your tongue off of that!
167596,L164559,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"But you should, now that you are becoming a father."
167597,L164558,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I don't care.
167598,L164557,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract."
167599,L164556,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Look here now--
167600,L164555,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Good evening, Neighbor Stone."
167601,L164307,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847."
167602,L164306,u4828,m322,JABEZ,The seventh day of April --
167603,L164305,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?"
167604,L164304,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Well, I'll be --"
167605,L164303,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire!"
167606,L164301,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?"
167607,L164300,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"No, no! Give it to me!"
167608,L164299,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--"
167609,L164298,u4828,m322,JABEZ,What does it mean here -- about my soul?
167610,L164297,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time."
167611,L164296,u4828,m322,JABEZ,It's mine?
167612,L164295,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen."
167613,L164294,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Yes, why shouldn't it?"
167614,L164293,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!"
167615,L164292,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Where did it come from?
167616,L164279,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
167617,L164278,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--"
167618,L164277,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you."
167619,L164276,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Opportunities?
167620,L164275,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
167621,L164274,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did."
167622,L164273,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
167623,L165029,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven."
167624,L165028,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!"
167625,L165022,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
167626,L165021,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Well, I --"
167627,L165020,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?"
167628,L164937,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler."
167629,L164936,u4828,m322,JABEZ,There's no joy in it for me.
167630,L164935,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!"
167631,L164933,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug."
167632,L164932,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Not long -- now.
167633,L164931,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
167634,L164924,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Yes -- at midnight.
167635,L164923,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too."
167636,L164922,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began."
167637,L164921,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
167638,L164880,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!"
167639,L164879,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child."
167640,L164878,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
167641,L164877,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it."
167642,L164876,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!"
167643,L164875,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything."
167644,L164874,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?"
167645,L164873,u4828,m322,JABEZ,What -- what's on your mind?
167646,L164872,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?"
167647,L164871,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!"
167648,L164428,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.
167649,L164427,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary."
167650,L164426,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you."
167651,L164405,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!"
167652,L164404,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!"
167653,L164397,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim."
167654,L164396,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster."
167655,L164395,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
167656,L164394,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Thank you, Mr. Webster."
167657,L164393,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?"
167658,L164392,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Ten throws it is.
167659,L164391,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
167660,L164775,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Shake!
167661,L164774,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
167662,L164773,u4828,m322,JABEZ,How much?
167663,L164772,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,Why not -- ?
167664,L164771,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
167665,L164770,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,You are not so sure that he'll come.
167666,L164769,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster."
167667,L164768,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,Well -- yes --
167668,L164767,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?"
167669,L164766,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
167670,L164765,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: ""Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor."" Golly, I can see their eyes pop already."
167671,L164764,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,You want me to go around --
167672,L164763,u4828,m322,JABEZ,You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
167673,L164762,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted."
167674,L164761,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,The only one you missed -- is the President.
167675,L164760,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
167676,L164759,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,Yes.
167677,L164758,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
167678,L164757,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,Dan'l Webster?
167679,L164756,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
167680,L164755,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,Why of course --
167681,L164754,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
167682,L164753,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,"Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --"
167683,L164749,u4828,m322,JABEZ,You really think so?
167684,L164748,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,"How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here."
167685,L164747,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire."
167686,L164488,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,Well? Don't a politician have to be?
167687,L164487,u4828,m322,JABEZ,But -- I was just lucky.
167688,L164484,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
167689,L164483,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,"And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman."
167690,L164477,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Camomile tea!
167691,L164476,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,"Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?"
167692,L164475,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Headache -- Squire?
167693,L164474,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,Oh!
167694,L164473,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,"Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--"
167695,L164472,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice."
167696,L164469,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks."
167697,L164468,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,"Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --"
167698,L164465,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,"Morning, Jabez."
167699,L164464,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Why -- good morning, Squire."
167700,L164434,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Shall we?
167701,L164433,u4835,m322,SQUIRE,"Coming along, Jabez?"
167702,L165019,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary!
167703,L165018,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez -- Jabez!
167704,L164930,u4831,m322,MARY,"All right, Jabez ..."
167705,L164929,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"You must go now, Mary -- you must!"
167706,L164919,u4831,m322,MARY,"Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?"
167707,L164918,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary! Come back ...
167708,L164917,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez!
167709,L164916,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
167710,L164821,u4828,m322,JABEZ,What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?
167711,L164820,u4831,m322,MARY,"It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all."
167712,L164819,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?"
167713,L164817,u4831,m322,MARY,"I don't know, Jabez."
167714,L164816,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Why don't they come --
167715,L164705,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!"
167716,L164704,u4831,m322,MARY,Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
167717,L164703,u4828,m322,JABEZ,It shows on your face.
167718,L164702,u4831,m322,MARY,"But Jabez, I never said that!"
167719,L164701,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything."
167720,L164700,u4831,m322,MARY,"My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be."
167721,L164699,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Isn't that your own fault?
167722,L164698,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
167723,L164693,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary."
167724,L164692,u4831,m322,MARY,I am going to lock him up.
167725,L164691,u4828,m322,JABEZ,What happened.... Where are you taking him?
167726,L164637,u4831,m322,MARY,"Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --"
167727,L164636,u4828,m322,JABEZ,What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
167728,L164635,u4831,m322,MARY,"Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --"
167729,L164602,u4831,m322,MARY,"Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day."
167730,L164601,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Well -- I -- I-
167731,L164596,u4831,m322,MARY,"Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son."
167732,L164595,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary --
167733,L164571,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
167734,L164570,u4831,m322,MARY,Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined.
167735,L164518,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind."
167736,L164517,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
167737,L164514,u4828,m322,JABEZ,And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
167738,L164513,u4831,m322,MARY,"No, no. I don't want to be idle."
167739,L164512,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
167740,L164511,u4831,m322,MARY,But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
167741,L164510,u4828,m322,JABEZ,But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
167742,L164509,u4831,m322,MARY,"It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman."
167743,L164508,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I'm serious.
167744,L164507,u4831,m322,MARY,"Yes, Mr. Selectman!"
167745,L164506,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary."
167746,L164505,u4831,m322,MARY,I'll never get my washing done.
167747,L164504,u4828,m322,JABEZ,You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
167748,L164494,u4831,m322,MARY,Oh -- Jabez.
167749,L164493,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
167750,L164480,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Thanks, Mary."
167751,L164479,u4831,m322,MARY,"I'll get it, Jabez."
167752,L164478,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on."
167753,L164462,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez --
167754,L164461,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary --
167755,L164460,u4831,m322,MARY,"Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here."
167756,L164459,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --"
167757,L164458,u4831,m322,MARY,"There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come."
167758,L164454,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
167759,L164453,u4831,m322,MARY,You'll never change -- will you?
167760,L164452,u4828,m322,JABEZ,There is nothing to worry about now.
167761,L164451,u4831,m322,MARY,Worried!
167762,L164450,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Tired?
167763,L164449,u4831,m322,MARY,But I'm glad to be home again --
167764,L164448,u4831,m322,MARY,"Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --"
167765,L164447,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Remember, Mary, how he said it: ""Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone,"" and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth."
167766,L164436,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day."
167767,L164435,u4831,m322,MARY,"We must go on home, Jabez."
167768,L164358,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Looks right elegant, Mary."
167769,L164357,u4831,m322,MARY,"What do you think of that, Jabez?"
167770,L164327,u4831,m322,MARY,I'd love to.
167771,L164326,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
167772,L164325,u4831,m322,MARY,"It feels fine now, Jabez."
167773,L164315,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
167774,L164314,u4831,m322,MARY,"Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same."
167775,L164313,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary -- what would you do?
167776,L164312,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez!
167777,L164311,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
167778,L164267,u4831,m322,MARY,"No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything."
167779,L164266,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I'll get the doctor.
167780,L164263,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary -- how do you feel?
167781,L164262,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez ...
167782,L164261,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary--
167783,L164250,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment."
167784,L164249,u4831,m322,MARY,Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
167785,L164248,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in."
167786,L164247,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez!
167787,L164237,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that."
167788,L164236,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
167789,L164235,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?"
167790,L164234,u4831,m322,MARY,"You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --"
167791,L164233,u4828,m322,JABEZ,To save us work on the spring plowing?
167792,L164232,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
167793,L164231,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him."
167794,L164230,u4831,m322,MARY,"It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens."
167795,L164229,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse."
167796,L164228,u4831,m322,MARY,Not all of it?
167797,L164227,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Mary -- it's gone.
167798,L164226,u4831,m322,MARY,Do you think I'm grudging it?
167799,L164225,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Your butter money?
167800,L164224,u4831,m322,MARY,We can still use my butter money.
167801,L164223,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Well -- what are we going to do?
167802,L164216,u4828,m322,JABEZ,If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.
167803,L164215,u4831,m322,MARY,That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
167804,L164214,u4828,m322,JABEZ,""" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?"
167805,L164170,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?"
167806,L164169,u4831,m322,MARY,Who is it?
167807,L164168,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate."
167808,L164158,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?"
167809,L164157,u4831,m322,MARY,He's stubborn as a Stone.
167810,L164152,u4828,m322,JABEZ,That's what we said.
167811,L164151,u4831,m322,MARY,"Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer."
167812,L164150,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first."
167813,L164149,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Yep.
167814,L164148,u4831,m322,MARY,"Oh, Jabez."
167815,L164147,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I think his leg is broken.
167816,L164140,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"You're right, Mary."
167817,L164139,u4831,m322,MARY,"Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is."
167818,L164138,u4828,m322,JABEZ,What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
167819,L164134,u4828,m322,JABEZ,All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
167820,L164133,u4831,m322,MARY,"He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too."
167821,L164132,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Down, Shep! Down!"
167822,L164131,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Coming.
167823,L164130,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez -- help!
167824,L165025,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster."
167825,L165024,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!"
167826,L164915,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--"
167827,L164914,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
167828,L164913,u4829,m322,MA STONE,My son ... what's the matter?
167829,L164654,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!"
167830,L164653,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I want you to fix these fish!
167831,L164604,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Sure, Ma."
167832,L164603,u4829,m322,MA STONE,You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
167833,L164594,u4829,m322,MA STONE,Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
167834,L164593,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight."
167835,L164592,u4829,m322,MA STONE,You'll be a father any minute now.
167836,L164591,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Ma -- is she? --
167837,L164569,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!"
167838,L164568,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out."
167839,L164567,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I say -- it don't matter.
167840,L164566,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"What's that you say, Son?"
167841,L164565,u4828,m322,JABEZ,It don't matter!
167842,L164564,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!"
167843,L164553,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters."
167844,L164552,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?"
167845,L164551,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him."
167846,L164550,u4829,m322,MA STONE,Wouldn't profit him none.
167847,L164549,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --"
167848,L164548,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference."
167849,L164547,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Do you really think that?
167850,L164546,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son."
167851,L164545,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?"
167852,L164544,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Me -- a son.
167853,L164543,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you."
167854,L164542,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all."
167855,L164541,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States."
167856,L164540,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
167857,L164538,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance."
167858,L164537,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"My son! Do you really think, Ma...."
167859,L164536,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world."
167860,L164516,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --"
167861,L164515,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again."
167862,L164324,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?"
167863,L164323,u4829,m322,MA STONE,Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
167864,L164319,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?"
167865,L164318,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!"
167866,L164317,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
167867,L164316,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"You found it in the barn, hey?"
167868,L164260,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!"
167869,L164259,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Hush up such talk, Jabez!"
167870,L164258,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think."
167871,L164257,u4829,m322,MA STONE,Well ... make him keep quiet.
167872,L164256,u4828,m322,JABEZ,I dunno.
167873,L164255,u4829,m322,MA STONE,What's ailing that dog?
167874,L164246,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"All right, son -- if it helps."
167875,L164245,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Helps sometimes to say it.
167876,L164244,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ..."
167877,L164243,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!"
167878,L164242,u4829,m322,MA STONE,I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
167879,L164241,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?"
167880,L164164,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!"
167881,L164163,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper."
167882,L164162,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?"
167883,L164161,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish."
167884,L164160,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Hard luck -- like me.
167885,L164159,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"You know that, son."
167886,L164156,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --"
167887,L164155,u4829,m322,MA STONE,Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
167888,L164154,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Consarn the consarn --
167889,L164153,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"""There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."""
167890,L164674,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum."
167891,L164673,u4834,m322,SHERIFF,"Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning."
167892,L164672,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Come in, Sheriff."
167893,L164490,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Very well, folks. I accept."
167894,L164489,u4834,m322,SHERIFF,It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
167895,L164330,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him."
167896,L164329,u4834,m322,SHERIFF,"Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment."
167897,L164328,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"Hello, Sheriff."
167898,L164221,u4834,m322,SHERIFF,"The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary."
167899,L164220,u4828,m322,JABEZ,Let him try it.
167900,L164219,u4834,m322,SHERIFF,Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
167901,L164218,u4828,m322,JABEZ,"It's all right, Sheriff."
167902,L164217,u4834,m322,SHERIFF,"Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez."
167903,L164815,u4831,m322,MARY,I won't forget.
167904,L164814,u4829,m322,MA STONE,Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
167905,L164813,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing."
167906,L164812,u4831,m322,MARY,You aren't angry with me?
167907,L164811,u4829,m322,MA STONE,So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
167908,L164716,u4831,m322,MARY,I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
167909,L164715,u4829,m322,MA STONE,What's that?
167910,L164714,u4831,m322,MARY,"Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!"
167911,L164713,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all."
167912,L164712,u4831,m322,MARY,"Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself."
167913,L164711,u4829,m322,MA STONE,Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
167914,L164652,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
167915,L164651,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!"
167916,L164649,u4831,m322,MARY,"Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --"
167917,L164648,u4829,m322,MA STONE,Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
167918,L164629,u4831,m322,MARY,What mountain?
167919,L164628,u4829,m322,MA STONE,The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
167920,L164627,u4831,m322,MARY,What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
167921,L164503,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?"
167922,L164502,u4831,m322,MARY,"You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?"
167923,L164321,u4829,m322,MA STONE,H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
167924,L164320,u4831,m322,MARY,I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
167925,L164265,u4831,m322,MARY,"Yes, Jabez -- don't worry."
167926,L164264,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out."
167927,L164167,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read."
167928,L164166,u4831,m322,MARY,"That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma."
167929,L164145,u4831,m322,MARY,I guess we won't.
167930,L164144,u4829,m322,MA STONE,"Well, I guess we won't be going to church today."
167931,L164137,u4831,m322,MARY,"Coming, Ma."
167932,L164136,u4829,m322,MA STONE,Mary -- Jabez --
167933,L164135,u4831,m322,MARY,"You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty."
167934,L164411,u4830,m322,MARTIN,"Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --"
167935,L164410,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?"
167936,L164409,u4830,m322,MARTIN,"Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?"
167937,L164408,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you."
167938,L164407,u4830,m322,MARTIN,"Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet."
167939,L164406,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?"
167940,L165034,u4831,m322,MARY,She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
167941,L165033,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
167942,L164928,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"I'll do my best, Mary."
167943,L164927,u4831,m322,MARY,Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
167944,L164926,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady."
167945,L164925,u4831,m322,MARY,Jabez ...
167946,L164870,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow."
167947,L164869,u4831,m322,MARY,Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
167948,L164741,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!"
167949,L164740,u4831,m322,MARY,"Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?"
167950,L164739,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things."
167951,L164738,u4831,m322,MARY,"You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault."
167952,L164737,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself."
167953,L164736,u4831,m322,MARY,"Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say."
167954,L164735,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
167955,L164734,u4831,m322,MARY,"Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that."
167956,L164733,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?"
167957,L164732,u4831,m322,MARY,"Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner."
167958,L164731,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs."
167959,L164730,u4831,m322,MARY,Of course not --
167960,L164729,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
167961,L164728,u4831,m322,MARY,"No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?"
167962,L164727,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie --"
167963,L164431,u4831,m322,MARY,"-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster."
167964,L164430,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him."
167965,L164429,u4831,m322,MARY,It is.
167966,L164726,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend."
167967,L164725,u4832,m322,OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE,Just someone from New Hampshire!
167968,L164724,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --"
167969,L164723,u4832,m322,OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE,"Someone to see you, Dan'l!"
167970,L164722,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Hullooo!
167971,L164721,u4832,m322,OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE,"Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!"
167972,L165016,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ..."
167973,L165015,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
167974,L164985,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,I object.
167975,L164984,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A."
167976,L164973,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!"
167977,L164972,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!"
167978,L164971,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
167979,L164970,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --"
167980,L164969,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians."
167981,L164968,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,You mean -- a jury trial?
167982,L164967,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
167983,L164966,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours."
167984,L164965,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship."
167985,L164964,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
167986,L164963,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince."
167987,L164962,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form."
167988,L164961,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it."
167989,L164960,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now."
167990,L164948,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Cup for cup!
167991,L164947,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?"
167992,L164946,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy.
167993,L164945,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep."
167994,L164944,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Me?
167995,L164943,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?"
167996,L164942,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself."
167997,L164941,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
167998,L164940,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
167999,L164939,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Mr. Webster, I presume?"
168000,L164390,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,Pretty good -- that's perfect!
168001,L164389,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,"Say, that's pretty good, young man."
168002,L164388,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"I'll be there, too!"
168003,L164387,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
168004,L164386,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir."
168005,L164385,u4839,m322,WEBSTER,Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
168006,L164384,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster."
168007,L164353,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now."
168008,L164352,u4836,m322,STEVENS,I can't be honest with them.
168009,L164351,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,Why don't you?
168010,L164350,u4836,m322,STEVENS,"No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ..."
168011,L164349,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,You can talk to me ...
168012,L164348,u4836,m322,STEVENS,I want someone to talk to ...
168013,L164347,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense."
168014,L164346,u4836,m322,STEVENS,"That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!"
168015,L164345,u4833,m322,SCRATCH,"My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea."
168016,L164344,u4836,m322,STEVENS,I wanted to give it all to the church.
168017,L165102,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,"Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy."
168018,L165101,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"You're all right, Argyle."
168019,L165099,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,I'll find someplace.
168020,L165098,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
168021,L165097,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"It's corny, but I could live with it."
168022,L165096,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,"So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?"
168023,L165094,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,That is Christmas music.
168024,L165093,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,How 'bout some Christmas music?
168025,L165092,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,Mind if I play some tunes?
168026,L165091,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Like I said, Argyle...you're fast."
168027,L165090,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,"You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?"
168028,L165089,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move."
168029,L165088,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,"So, why didn't you come?"
168030,L165087,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
168031,L165086,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,But meant her moving here.
168032,L165085,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"She had a good job, it turned into a great career."
168033,L165084,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,"So, you divorced of what?"
168034,L165083,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"It's okay, it's okay."
168035,L165082,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,"Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me."
168036,L165081,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?"
168037,L165080,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,"Meanwhile, you still live in New York?"
168038,L165079,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,The past six months.
168039,L165078,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,"The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?"
168040,L165077,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Married.
168041,L165076,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
168042,L165074,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
168043,L165073,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,"Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo."
168044,L165072,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
168045,L165071,u4840,m323,ARGYLE,"Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag."
168046,L165070,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,I'm John McClane.
168047,L165611,u4841,m323,BIG JOHNSON,We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
168048,L165610,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --"
168049,L165548,u4841,m323,BIG JOHNSON,"If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation."
168050,L165547,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"No, sir."
168051,L165546,u4841,m323,BIG JOHNSON,One of yours?
168052,L165530,u4841,m323,BIG JOHNSON,Not any more.
168053,L165529,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here."
168054,L165528,u4841,m323,BIG JOHNSON,I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
168055,L165448,u4842,m323,ELLIS,"Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?"
168056,L165447,u4844,m323,HOLLY,What are you going to do?
168057,L165446,u4842,m323,ELLIS,I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
168058,L165445,u4844,m323,HOLLY,Where are you going?
168059,L165242,u4844,m323,HOLLY,Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
168060,L165241,u4842,m323,ELLIS,"His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance..."
168061,L165240,u4844,m323,HOLLY,How about his job?
168062,L165239,u4842,m323,ELLIS,"John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?"

168065,L165236,u4844,m323,HOLLY,They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
168066,L165235,u4842,m323,ELLIS,What's happening?
168067,L165487,u4842,m323,ELLIS,"John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?"
168068,L165486,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --"
168069,L165485,u4842,m323,ELLIS,"What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television..."
168070,L165483,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do --"
168071,L165482,u4842,m323,ELLIS,"John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy..."
168072,L165478,u4842,m323,ELLIS,Tell me about it.
168073,L165477,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
168074,L165476,u4842,m323,ELLIS,I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
168075,L165475,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Ellis, what have you told them?"
168076,L165474,u4842,m323,ELLIS,"John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works."
168077,L165460,u4842,m323,ELLIS,The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
168078,L165459,u4843,m323,HANS,I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
168079,L165458,u4842,m323,ELLIS,"Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight."
168080,L165457,u4843,m323,HANS,You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
168081,L165456,u4842,m323,ELLIS,"Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?"
168082,L165455,u4843,m323,HANS,You're very perceptive.
168083,L165453,u4843,m323,HANS,What does he want?
168084,L165452,u4842,m323,ELLIS,Hope I'm not interrupting...?
168085,L165505,u4843,m323,HANS,"I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply."
168086,L165504,u4845,m323,KARL,'Asian Dawn Movement?'
168087,L165451,u4845,m323,KARL,I don't want neutral...I want dead --
168088,L165450,u4843,m323,HANS,If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
168089,L165449,u4845,m323,KARL,-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
168090,L165325,u4843,m323,HANS,He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
168091,L165324,u4845,m323,KARL,"He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing."
168092,L165267,u4843,m323,HANS,"Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!"
168093,L165266,u4845,m323,KARL,"Hans, he killed by brother --"
168094,L165234,u4845,m323,KARL,And if he alters it...?						*
168095,L165233,u4843,m323,HANS,No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
168096,L165232,u4845,m323,KARL,He was my only brother...my only family!  I want blood for my blood.  We search...now.
168097,L165231,u4843,m323,HANS,I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
168098,L165202,u4843,m323,HANS,See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
168099,L165201,u4845,m323,KARL,Nothing...
168100,L165199,u4843,m323,HANS,Okay.
168101,L165198,u4849,m323,TAKAGI,I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
168102,L165193,u4849,m323,TAKAGI,"It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!"
168103,L165192,u4843,m323,HANS,"The code key, please...?"
168104,L165191,u4843,m323,HANS,Who said we were terrorists?
168105,L165190,u4849,m323,TAKAGI,You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
168106,L165189,u4843,m323,HANS,Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
168107,L165182,u4849,m323,TAKAGI,"This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it."
168108,L165181,u4843,m323,HANS,"It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection."
168109,L165689,u4843,m323,HANS,"'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked."
168110,L165688,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?"
168111,L165687,u4843,m323,HANS,"No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!"
168112,L165686,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"That was Gary Cooper, shithead..."
168113,L165685,u4843,m323,HANS,"Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly."
168114,L165568,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi.
168115,L165567,u4843,m323,HANS,I'm going to count to three...
168116,L165566,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives."
168117,L165565,u4843,m323,HANS,Put it down now.
168118,L165564,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Hans.  Your Hans.
168119,L165561,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Sounds better than nothing.
168120,L165560,u4843,m323,HANS,"One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you..."
168121,L165559,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Bill, you know how to use a handgun?"
168122,L165558,u4843,m323,HANS,William Clay.  Call me Bill.
168123,L165557,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane."
168124,L165556,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
168125,L165555,u4843,m323,HANS,New York...
168126,L165554,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,I'm a cop from New York.
168127,L165553,u4843,m323,HANS,You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
168128,L165537,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Only if New Jersey counts.
168129,L165536,u4843,m323,HANS,You...you're an American?
168130,L165533,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?"
168131,L165532,u4843,m323,HANS,"--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --"
168132,L165489,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Go fuck yourself.
168133,L165488,u4843,m323,HANS,"Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about."
168134,L165322,u4843,m323,HANS,"Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?"
168135,L165321,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts."
168136,L165320,u4843,m323,HANS,"I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion."
168137,L165319,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?"
168138,L165318,u4843,m323,HANS,Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
168139,L165316,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -"
168140,L165315,u4843,m323,HANS,"Who are you, then?"
168141,L165314,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Bad for your health anyway.
168142,L165607,u4850,m323,THEO,The only thing left for them is the City Grid...  ...They may not do it.
168143,L165606,u4843,m323,HANS,Encourage them to be bolder.

168146,L165581,u4843,m323,HANS,* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
168147,L165580,u4850,m323,THEO,"You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer..."
168148,L165329,u4843,m323,HANS,Then don't waste time talking to me.
168149,L165328,u4850,m323,THEO,"Three down, four to go --"

168151,L165326,u4850,m323,THEO,Yo!
168152,L165209,u4843,m323,HANS,If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
168153,L165208,u4850,m323,THEO,Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
168154,L165207,u4843,m323,HANS,How long?
168155,L165195,u4850,m323,THEO,I told you...
168156,L165194,u4843,m323,HANS,Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
168157,L165658,u4843,m323,HANS,"I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite."
168158,L165657,u4844,m323,HOLLY,"After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief."
168159,L165369,u4844,m323,HOLLY,Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
168160,L165368,u4843,m323,HANS,"Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?"
168161,L165367,u4843,m323,HANS,"Yes, you're right.  It will be done."
168162,L165366,u4844,m323,HOLLY,"Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom."
168163,L165365,u4843,m323,HANS,No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
168164,L165364,u4844,m323,HOLLY,"We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa."
168165,L165363,u4843,m323,HANS,Go on.
168166,L165362,u4844,m323,HOLLY,You did.  You murdered by Boss.  Now...  They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you.
168167,L165361,u4843,m323,HANS,Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
168168,L165360,u4844,m323,HOLLY,I...have a request.
168169,L165683,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?"
168170,L165682,u4844,m323,HOLLY,John!
168171,L165158,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Don't I always?
168172,L165157,u4844,m323,HOLLY,I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
168173,L165153,u4844,m323,HOLLY,"You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that, John.  I deserved that."
168174,L165152,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --"
168175,L165151,u4844,m323,HOLLY,My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
168176,L165150,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
168177,L165149,u4844,m323,HOLLY,"Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --"
168178,L165148,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor..."
168179,L165147,u4844,m323,HOLLY,"This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door..."
168180,L165146,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
168181,L165145,u4844,m323,HOLLY,...I've missed you.						*
168182,L165144,u4844,m323,HOLLY,"I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other."
168183,L165143,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"They would, huh?"
168184,L165142,u4844,m323,HOLLY,"Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house."
168185,L165141,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it."
168186,L165140,u4844,m323,HOLLY,Oh...Where does he live?
168187,L165139,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him."
168188,L165137,u4844,m323,HOLLY,That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
168189,L165136,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you."
168190,L165135,u4844,m323,HOLLY,What are you doing?
168191,L165133,u4844,m323,HOLLY,Sure.  Follow me.
168192,L165132,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?"
168193,L165129,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Yeah.  I remember our first date.
168194,L165128,u4849,m323,TAKAGI,You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
168195,L165123,u4849,m323,TAKAGI,"Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks."
168196,L165122,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
168197,L165121,u4849,m323,TAKAGI,Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
168198,L165120,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty."
168199,L165115,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,So I've heard.
168200,L165114,u4849,m323,TAKAGI,"I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company."
168201,L165113,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Yeah.  How'd you know?
168202,L165112,u4849,m323,TAKAGI,Holly Gennero?
168203,L165111,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Excuse me, I'm looking for --"
168204,L165697,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero."
168205,L165696,u4847,m323,POWELL,Bullshit.
168206,L165695,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you."
168207,L165630,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out."
168208,L165629,u4847,m323,POWELL,Roy?
168209,L165628,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?"
168210,L165627,u4847,m323,POWELL,I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
168211,L165626,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?"
168212,L165603,u4847,m323,POWELL,"Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step."
168213,L165602,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Powell?  What's going on?
168214,L165595,u4847,m323,POWELL,Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
168215,L165594,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,I still feel like shit.
168216,L165593,u4847,m323,POWELL,"Hey, you couldn't know."
168217,L165592,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
168218,L165591,u4847,m323,POWELL,"Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again."
168219,L165590,u4847,m323,POWELL,I...I shot a kid.
168220,L165589,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"They way you drive, I can see why."
168221,L165586,u4847,m323,POWELL,You don't want to know.
168222,L165585,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Yeah?  What's the odds?
168223,L165584,u4847,m323,POWELL,They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
168224,L165583,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists."
168225,L165582,u4847,m323,POWELL,Roy?  You still with us?
168226,L165518,u4847,m323,POWELL,"In my youth, partner.  In my youth."
168227,L165517,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets."
168228,L165516,u4847,m323,POWELL,"Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang."
168229,L165515,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --"
168230,L165514,u4847,m323,POWELL,"I'm here, cowboy."
168231,L165513,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Al?  Al, you there?"
168232,L165467,u4847,m323,POWELL,It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
168233,L165466,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
168234,L165465,u4847,m323,POWELL,"Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?"
168235,L165464,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
168236,L165463,u4847,m323,POWELL,"'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'"
168237,L165462,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?"
168238,L165441,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Thanks...partner.
168239,L165440,u4847,m323,POWELL,"Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there."
168240,L165428,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,Two?  Are you sure?
168241,L165427,u4847,m323,POWELL,"No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast."
168242,L165426,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
168243,L165425,u4847,m323,POWELL,"Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?"
168244,L165389,u4847,m323,POWELL,"I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray."
168245,L165388,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --"
168246,L165387,u4847,m323,POWELL,"I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?"
168247,L165346,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"They're all yours, Al.  Good luck."
168248,L165345,u4847,m323,POWELL,"Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?"
168249,L165344,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,'Roy'.
168250,L165343,u4847,m323,POWELL,"Uh, what do I call you?"
168251,L165342,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,I'm ahead of you...partner.
168252,L165341,u4847,m323,POWELL,"I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em."
168253,L165340,u4846,m323,MCCLANE,"I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay."
168254,L165339,u4847,m323,POWELL,How do you know?
168255,L165498,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
168256,L165497,u4847,m323,POWELL,This is --
168257,L165494,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed."
168258,L165493,u4847,m323,POWELL,"He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!"
168259,L165492,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!"
168260,L165491,u4847,m323,POWELL,"Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!"
168261,L165490,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --"
168262,L165431,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"Give me that.  Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --"
168263,L165430,u4847,m323,POWELL,Yessir.
168264,L165429,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,Is that him?
168265,L165380,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
168266,L165379,u4847,m323,POWELL,What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
168267,L165378,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!"
168268,L165377,u4847,m323,POWELL,Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
168269,L165376,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,What's it look like?  We're going in.
168270,L165375,u4847,m323,POWELL,What's going on?
168271,L165358,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!"
168272,L165357,u4847,m323,POWELL,"A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --"
168273,L165356,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,How do you know?
168274,L165355,u4847,m323,POWELL,"I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge."
168275,L165354,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --"
168276,L165353,u4847,m323,POWELL,"We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others."
168277,L165352,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,Then who the hell have you been talking too?
168278,L165351,u4847,m323,POWELL,"The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them."
168279,L165350,u4848,m323,ROBINSON,"Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?"
168280,L165349,u4847,m323,POWELL,"I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell."
168281,L167125,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help."
168282,L167124,u4851,m324,COMMISSIONER,"If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that."
168283,L167123,u4859,m324,MORETTI,Listen.
168284,L167122,u4851,m324,COMMISSIONER,Don't let 'em off the ground.
168285,L167121,u4859,m324,MORETTI,What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
168286,L167120,u4851,m324,COMMISSIONER,They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
168287,L167119,u4859,m324,MORETTI,So whatsa deal?
168288,L167118,u4851,m324,COMMISSIONER,"Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!"
168289,L167117,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out."
168290,L167116,u4851,m324,COMMISSIONER,"Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?"
168291,L167115,u4859,m324,MORETTI,No.  I never smile any more.
168292,L167114,u4851,m324,COMMISSIONER,Gene -- you smilin'?
168293,L167488,u4852,m324,DRIVER,"You men shoot, aim for the white meat!"
168294,L167487,u4866,m324,SONNY,You'll be okay.
168295,L167483,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now."
168296,L167482,u4852,m324,DRIVER,"Aw, hey..."
168297,L167476,u4866,m324,SONNY,Okay.
168298,L167475,u4852,m324,DRIVER,"God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'"
168299,L167474,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Yes, I would."
168300,L167473,u4852,m324,DRIVER,"I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it."
168301,L167472,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Come on, what's under this?"
168302,L167471,u4852,m324,DRIVER,"Jesus, you're the man!"
168303,L167470,u4852,m324,DRIVER,Yeah.
168304,L167469,u4866,m324,SONNY,These seats come out?
168305,L167375,u4853,m324,HEIDI,"Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter."
168306,L167374,u4866,m324,SONNY,"They're not after you, they're after me."
168307,L167373,u4853,m324,HEIDI,"Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear."
168308,L167372,u4866,m324,SONNY,Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
168309,L167371,u4853,m324,HEIDI,"I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?"
168310,L167370,u4866,m324,SONNY,Don't call yourself fat.
168311,L167369,u4853,m324,HEIDI,"...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat."
168312,L167368,u4853,m324,HEIDI,See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home...
168313,L167367,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!"
168314,L167366,u4853,m324,HEIDI,"I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river."
168315,L167365,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Heidi, I'm dying."
168316,L167364,u4853,m324,HEIDI,"They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you."
168317,L167363,u4866,m324,SONNY,What about the kids?
168318,L167362,u4853,m324,HEIDI,"Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!"
168319,L166663,u4866,m324,SONNY,It's okay... it's okay...
168320,L166662,u4854,m324,JACKIE,"Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry..."
168321,L166661,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Take the subway.  We need the car.  Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!"
168322,L166660,u4854,m324,JACKIE,"Well, how'll I get home?"
168323,L166659,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Hey, don't take the car!"
168324,L166649,u4866,m324,SONNY,It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
168325,L166648,u4854,m324,JACKIE,Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
168326,L166647,u4866,m324,SONNY,Jackie - what are you talking about?
168327,L166646,u4854,m324,JACKIE,"Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes."
168328,L166819,u4855,m324,JENNY,I love you.
168329,L166818,u4858,m324,MAN,I'll kiss the baby for you.
168330,L166813,u4855,m324,JENNY,"Oh, yeah, I will..."
168331,L166812,u4858,m324,MAN,"Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close."
168332,L166811,u4855,m324,JENNY,Yeah.  A lot of guns.
168333,L166810,u4858,m324,MAN,The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
168334,L166809,u4855,m324,JENNY,What guns?
168335,L166806,u4855,m324,JENNY,"Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge."
168336,L166805,u4858,m324,MAN,It looks like a whole roast.
168337,L166804,u4855,m324,JENNY,He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
168338,L166803,u4858,m324,MAN,Jenny?
168339,L167051,u4856,m324,JESUS FREAK,Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
168340,L167050,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?"
168341,L167049,u4856,m324,JESUS FREAK,"That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost."
168342,L167048,u4866,m324,SONNY,"No.  Look, we're kind of...."
168343,L167047,u4856,m324,JESUS FREAK,"You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?"
168344,L167046,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Yeah, well I don't blame him."
168345,L167045,u4856,m324,JESUS FREAK,Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
168346,L167360,u4857,m324,LEON,You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
168347,L167359,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!"
168348,L167358,u4857,m324,LEON,"Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?"
168349,L167357,u4866,m324,SONNY,Right.  See you sometime.
168350,L167356,u4857,m324,LEON,"Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage."
168351,L167355,u4866,m324,SONNY,I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
168352,L167354,u4857,m324,LEON,It's my only chance!
168353,L167353,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Well, then..."
168354,L167352,u4857,m324,LEON,Yeah... yeah.
168355,L167351,u4866,m324,SONNY,Do you still want the operation?
168356,L167350,u4857,m324,LEON,Well... I don't know if I have or not.
168357,L167349,u4866,m324,SONNY,That's good then.  You've found something.
168358,L167348,u4857,m324,LEON,"Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me."
168359,L167347,u4866,m324,SONNY,"All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?"
168360,L167346,u4857,m324,LEON,Yeah... yeah!
168361,L167345,u4866,m324,SONNY,Are they on the phone still?
168362,L167344,u4857,m324,LEON,They won't talk to you.
168363,L167343,u4866,m324,SONNY,"All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?"
168364,L167342,u4857,m324,LEON,"Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here..."
168365,L167341,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?"
168366,L167340,u4857,m324,LEON,Look... don't throw that on me.
168367,L167339,u4866,m324,SONNY,Look... who's on the phone?
168368,L167338,u4857,m324,LEON,No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
168369,L167337,u4866,m324,SONNY,You don't have a choice?
168370,L167336,u4857,m324,LEON,I don't have a choice.
168371,L167335,u4866,m324,SONNY,"That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?"
168372,L167334,u4857,m324,LEON,Yeah.
168373,L167333,u4866,m324,SONNY,Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
168374,L167332,u4857,m324,LEON,"Sonny, would you please just tell them... please..."
168375,L167331,u4866,m324,SONNY,All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
168376,L167330,u4857,m324,LEON,"I can't survive in prison, Sonny..."
168377,L167329,u4866,m324,SONNY,Shit...
168378,L167328,u4857,m324,LEON,I gotta listen to it if they think...
168379,L167327,u4866,m324,SONNY,Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
168380,L167326,u4857,m324,LEON,Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
168381,L167325,u4866,m324,SONNY,"How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story."
168382,L167324,u4857,m324,LEON,"These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!"
168383,L167323,u4866,m324,SONNY,What?
168384,L167322,u4857,m324,LEON,Would you do something for me? Please?
168385,L167321,u4866,m324,SONNY,"He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!"
168386,L167320,u4857,m324,LEON,"Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!"
168387,L167319,u4866,m324,SONNY,I know I am.  I know!
168388,L167318,u4857,m324,LEON,"Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now."
168389,L167317,u4866,m324,SONNY,Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
168390,L167316,u4857,m324,LEON,So!  Sal is with you?
168391,L167315,u4866,m324,SONNY,Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in?
168392,L167314,u4857,m324,LEON,I like that... yeah!
168393,L167313,u4866,m324,SONNY,Denmark?  Sweden?
168394,L167312,u4857,m324,LEON,I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
168395,L167311,u4866,m324,SONNY,What am I supposed to do?
168396,L167310,u4857,m324,LEON,"God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there."
168397,L167309,u4866,m324,SONNY,I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
168398,L167308,u4857,m324,LEON,Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
168399,L167307,u4866,m324,SONNY,Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
168400,L167306,u4857,m324,LEON,Why you going to Algeria?
168401,L167305,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria."
168402,L167304,u4857,m324,LEON,Where you gonna go?
168403,L167303,u4866,m324,SONNY,I know!
168404,L167302,u4857,m324,LEON,You're really crazy.
168405,L167301,u4866,m324,SONNY,That's it.
168406,L167300,u4857,m324,LEON,You're crazy.
168407,L167299,u4866,m324,SONNY,"I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!"
168408,L167298,u4857,m324,LEON,I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
168409,L167297,u4866,m324,SONNY,"I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want."
168410,L167296,u4857,m324,LEON,What trip?
168411,L167295,u4866,m324,SONNY,"I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip..."
168412,L167294,u4857,m324,LEON,Well...
168413,L167293,u4866,m324,SONNY,All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
168414,L167292,u4857,m324,LEON,But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
168415,L167291,u4866,m324,SONNY,"I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money."
168416,L167290,u4857,m324,LEON,I'm sorry...
168417,L167289,u4866,m324,SONNY,"I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?"
168418,L167288,u4857,m324,LEON,Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
168419,L167287,u4866,m324,SONNY,I don't know what I'm doing.
168420,L167286,u4857,m324,LEON,"No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head..."
168421,L167285,u4866,m324,SONNY,Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
168422,L167284,u4857,m324,LEON,What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
168423,L167283,u4866,m324,SONNY,What are you talking about?
168424,L167282,u4857,m324,LEON,What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
168425,L167281,u4866,m324,SONNY,I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
168426,L167280,u4857,m324,LEON,Yeah... I know.
168427,L167279,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!"
168428,L167278,u4857,m324,LEON,Yeah.  So how are you?
168429,L167277,u4866,m324,SONNY,So... that sure is something.
168430,L167276,u4857,m324,LEON,You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
168431,L167275,u4866,m324,SONNY,Yeah...
168432,L167274,u4857,m324,LEON,"You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?"
168433,L167273,u4866,m324,SONNY,That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
168434,L167272,u4857,m324,LEON,Yeah.  It was terrible.
168435,L167271,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up."
168436,L167270,u4857,m324,LEON,I'm really shakey.
168437,L167269,u4866,m324,SONNY,Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
168438,L167268,u4857,m324,LEON,Ooohh....
168439,L167267,u4866,m324,SONNY,Well.... huh ...
168440,L167266,u4857,m324,LEON,I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
168441,L167265,u4866,m324,SONNY,Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
168442,L167264,u4857,m324,LEON,Well... I'm out of the hospital.
168443,L167263,u4866,m324,SONNY,How are you doing?
168444,L167262,u4857,m324,LEON,"Hello, Sonny."
168445,L167261,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Hello.  Hello, Leon."
168446,L167191,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"You think it over, Leon."
168447,L167190,u4857,m324,LEON,I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
168448,L167189,u4859,m324,MORETTI,How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
168449,L167188,u4857,m324,LEON,I'm afraid.
168450,L167187,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case."
168451,L167186,u4857,m324,LEON,I can't talk to him.
168452,L167185,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?"
168453,L167184,u4857,m324,LEON,"It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me."
168454,L167183,u4859,m324,MORETTI,He needed money?  For the operation for you?
168455,L167182,u4857,m324,LEON,"Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already."
168456,L167181,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"What kind of things, Leon?"
168457,L167180,u4857,m324,LEON,"He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things."
168458,L167179,u4859,m324,MORETTI,He's makin' threats in there.
168459,L167178,u4857,m324,LEON,"He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person."
168460,L167177,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Somebody's got to stop him, Leon."
168461,L167176,u4857,m324,LEON,What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
168462,L167175,u4859,m324,MORETTI,You try calling the police?
168463,L167174,u4857,m324,LEON,He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
168464,L167173,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?"
168465,L167172,u4857,m324,LEON,I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
168466,L167171,u4859,m324,MORETTI,He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
168467,L167170,u4857,m324,LEON,Oh no!
168468,L167169,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up."
168469,L167168,u4857,m324,LEON,"Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!"
168470,L167167,u4859,m324,MORETTI,Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
168471,L167166,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back."
168472,L167165,u4866,m324,SONNY,I want to talk to him.
168473,L167164,u4859,m324,MORETTI,He's all doped up.
168474,L167163,u4866,m324,SONNY,Is he all right?  Is he all right?
168475,L167154,u4859,m324,MORETTI,We're bringing in your wife...
168476,L167153,u4866,m324,SONNY,Yeah?
168477,L167102,u4866,m324,SONNY,Okay ...
168478,L167101,u4859,m324,MORETTI,Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
168479,L167100,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ..."
168480,L167099,u4859,m324,MORETTI,What else?
168481,L167098,u4866,m324,SONNY,All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
168482,L167097,u4859,m324,MORETTI,There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
168483,L167096,u4866,m324,SONNY,Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
168484,L167095,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ..."
168485,L167094,u4866,m324,SONNY,Don't fuck with me ...
168486,L167093,u4859,m324,MORETTI,Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
168487,L167092,u4866,m324,SONNY,"You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ..."
168488,L167091,u4859,m324,MORETTI,It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
168489,L167090,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Well, what were you doin' back there?"
168490,L167089,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got."
168491,L167088,u4866,m324,SONNY,You're full of shit ...
168492,L167087,u4859,m324,MORETTI,Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
168493,L167086,u4866,m324,SONNY,Yeah ...
168494,L167085,u4859,m324,MORETTI,Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
168495,L167084,u4866,m324,SONNY,Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
168496,L167083,u4859,m324,MORETTI,I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
168497,L167082,u4866,m324,SONNY,"So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?"
168498,L167081,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you."
168499,L167080,u4866,m324,SONNY,You tryin' to fuck me?
168500,L167079,u4859,m324,MORETTI,They were ...
168501,L167078,u4866,m324,SONNY,What the fuck do you want?
168502,L167076,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Sonny, come on out!"
168503,L167075,u4866,m324,SONNY,What the hell you doin' back there?
168504,L167030,u4859,m324,MORETTI,I'll see what they'll do.
168505,L167029,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet."
168506,L167028,u4859,m324,MORETTI,The girl hostages.
168507,L167027,u4866,m324,SONNY,What do you want?
168508,L167026,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Okay, what do you give me?"
168509,L167025,u4866,m324,SONNY,I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
168510,L167024,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Sonny, be reasonable!"
168511,L167023,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can."
168512,L167022,u4866,m324,SONNY,"I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge."
168513,L167021,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"It's okay, you got a lot of protection."
168514,L167020,u4866,m324,SONNY,He wanted to kill me!
168515,L166921,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Calm down... look at this, look at him...!"
168516,L166920,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Calm down, you're not ..."
168517,L166919,u4866,m324,SONNY,"When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!"
168518,L166918,u4859,m324,MORETTI,What?
168519,L166916,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Well, armed, then.  Nobody's been hurt.  Release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years -- you can be out in a year."
168520,L166915,u4866,m324,SONNY,... armed robbery ...
168521,L166914,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery."
168522,L166912,u4859,m324,MORETTI,I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
168523,L166911,u4866,m324,SONNY,"You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?"
168524,L166910,u4859,m324,MORETTI,Come on.  I want you to see something.
168525,L166909,u4866,m324,SONNY,You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
168526,L166889,u4866,m324,SONNY,So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
168527,L166888,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ..."
168528,L166887,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Oh, no ... Women is all we got."
168529,L166886,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Okay, give us the women."
168530,L166885,u4866,m324,SONNY,They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
168531,L166884,u4859,m324,MORETTI,How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
168532,L166883,u4866,m324,SONNY,Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
168533,L166882,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?"
168534,L166881,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Right -- I'm with you, buddy."
168535,L166880,u4859,m324,MORETTI,You frisk me.
168536,L166879,u4866,m324,SONNY,I frisk you?
168537,L166878,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess."
168538,L166877,u4866,m324,SONNY,Call me whatever you want.
168539,L166876,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?"
168540,L166875,u4866,m324,SONNY,One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
168541,L166874,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Sonny-boy, one word?"
168542,L166873,u4866,m324,SONNY,Call me Sonny-boy.
168543,L166872,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you."
168544,L166871,u4866,m324,SONNY,What do you want to know that for?
168545,L166870,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?"
168546,L166869,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?"
168547,L166868,u4859,m324,MORETTI,Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
168548,L166867,u4866,m324,SONNY,I got Sal.
168549,L166866,u4859,m324,MORETTI,How many you got in there?
168550,L166865,u4866,m324,SONNY,I'm not alone.
168551,L166864,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"You alone, or you got confederates?"
168552,L166863,u4866,m324,SONNY,They're okay.
168553,L166862,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay."
168554,L166861,u4866,m324,SONNY,I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
168555,L166860,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?"
168556,L166793,u4866,m324,SONNY,... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay?
168557,L166792,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?"
168558,L166791,u4866,m324,SONNY,What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
168559,L166770,u4859,m324,MORETTI,"This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you..."
168560,L166769,u4866,m324,SONNY,Who's this?
168561,L166768,u4859,m324,MORETTI,What are you doin' in there?
168562,L166767,u4866,m324,SONNY,Yeah.
168563,L167206,u4865,m324,SHELDON,"Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal.  Why don't I take it over now?"
168564,L167205,u4859,m324,MORETTI,He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
168565,L167204,u4865,m324,SHELDON,He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
168566,L167203,u4859,m324,MORETTI,What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
168567,L167202,u4865,m324,SHELDON,We're all set at Kennedy.
168568,L166853,u4865,m324,SHELDON,Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
168569,L166852,u4859,m324,MORETTI,Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
168570,L167498,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf..."
168571,L167497,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"What now, Sonny?"
168572,L167496,u4866,m324,SONNY,You got Bank Americard?
168573,L167463,u4866,m324,SONNY,I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary?
168574,L167462,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"No.  I had some legal training, but..."
168575,L167461,u4866,m324,SONNY,Are you a lawyer?
168576,L167460,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,Yeah?
168577,L167459,u4866,m324,SONNY,Mister Mulvaney?
168578,L167411,u4866,m324,SONNY,I don't think so.
168579,L167410,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,Why not?
168580,L167409,u4866,m324,SONNY,Yeah.
168581,L167408,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,Would I hire you?
168582,L167407,u4866,m324,SONNY,You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
168583,L167406,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"We like you, too."
168584,L167405,u4866,m324,SONNY,You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
168585,L167404,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I'm sorry.
168586,L167403,u4866,m324,SONNY,"You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way."
168587,L167400,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
168588,L167399,u4866,m324,SONNY,No you don't.
168589,L167398,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,Sure - we like you.
168590,L167397,u4866,m324,SONNY,You like me?
168591,L167396,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Special to me, too."
168592,L167395,u4866,m324,SONNY,They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
168593,L167394,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,They look like good kids.
168594,L167393,u4866,m324,SONNY,"I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney."
168595,L167386,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Oh, Jesus!  You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?"
168596,L167385,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I'll be God damned if you will.
168597,L167384,u4866,m324,SONNY,"You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out."
168598,L167383,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
168599,L167382,u4866,m324,SONNY,Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
168600,L167381,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I'm not going.  I'm okay.
168601,L167380,u4866,m324,SONNY,"You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ..."
168602,L167379,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
168603,L167107,u4866,m324,SONNY,"What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?"
168604,L167106,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,Are we going to get the ball rolling?
168605,L167058,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I don't know.
168606,L167057,u4866,m324,SONNY,Do you think we can turn it on?
168607,L167055,u4866,m324,SONNY,
168608,L167054,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess."
168609,L167053,u4866,m324,SONNY,Where's the air conditioning?
168610,L167004,u4866,m324,SONNY,Wait a minute ... I've been looking at this all wrong ... Let's look at it the other way ...
168611,L167003,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"What now, Sonny?"
168612,L167002,u4866,m324,SONNY,You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
168613,L166987,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
168614,L166986,u4866,m324,SONNY,Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
168615,L166959,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
168616,L166958,u4866,m324,SONNY,What?
168617,L166849,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I don't fool around with you.
168618,L166848,u4866,m324,SONNY,"You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?"
168619,L166846,u4866,m324,SONNY,"They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they don't give a damn.  In spite of that bank insurance.  You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty."
168620,L166845,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"If you take anybody, please take me."
168621,L166844,u4866,m324,SONNY,What if I take you with me?
168622,L166843,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?"
168623,L166842,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat."
168624,L166840,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Ah, I know!  You're being very cooperative.  I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?"
168625,L166839,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
168626,L166838,u4866,m324,SONNY,You got kids?
168627,L166835,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny."
168628,L166834,u4866,m324,SONNY,To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
168629,L166833,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Well, they go to guard school."
168630,L166832,u4866,m324,SONNY,Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
168631,L166831,u4866,m324,SONNY,You and me are checking the other ways in and out.
168632,L166830,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,Mulvaney...
168633,L166829,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Now, you -- what's your name?"
168634,L166802,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
168635,L166801,u4866,m324,SONNY,Where's the back door?
168636,L166776,u4866,m324,SONNY,I took too long.
168637,L166775,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero..."
168638,L166747,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Sal, get 'em in the vault."
168639,L166746,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Hello, Mulvaney here..."
168640,L166742,u4866,m324,SONNY,"You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us."
168641,L166741,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got."
168642,L166729,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,Give me the keys...
168643,L166728,u4866,m324,SONNY,The gun's right on your back...
168644,L166716,u4866,m324,SONNY,Gimme the keys to get outta here!
168645,L166715,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Howard, give him the keys..."
168646,L166708,u4866,m324,SONNY,Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
168647,L166707,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
168648,L166704,u4866,m324,SONNY,"My side, shit!"
168649,L166703,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Believe me, I'm on your side."
168650,L166702,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!"
168651,L166685,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick it in the bag..."
168652,L166684,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,It's all we got.
168653,L166683,u4866,m324,SONNY,This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
168654,L166678,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Come on, lemme load you up..."
168655,L166677,u4866,m324,SONNY,What's the matter with you?
168656,L166675,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?"
168657,L166674,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I must of been outta my mind.
168658,L166671,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I can take care of that.
168659,L166670,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Okay, is the vault open?"
168660,L166658,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Do what the gentleman says, Howard."
168661,L166657,u4866,m324,SONNY,Hey... let him out!
168662,L166653,u4866,m324,SONNY,If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
168663,L166652,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!"
168664,L166740,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]"
168665,L166739,u4864,m324,SAM,I'm glad it's okay.
168666,L166738,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Thanks again, Sam."
168667,L166737,u4864,m324,SAM,Okay.
168668,L166736,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out."
168669,L166735,u4864,m324,SAM,"Yeah.  Well, you're okay?"
168670,L166734,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all."
168671,L166733,u4864,m324,SAM,You all right?
168672,L166732,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket."
168673,L166731,u4864,m324,SAM,Everything's all right?  You okay?
168674,L166730,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"What is it, Sam?"
168675,L167557,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,Hey.  It's raining.
168676,L167556,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"You were terrific, too!"
168677,L167555,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?"
168678,L167415,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,"Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there."
168679,L167414,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him."
168680,L167252,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"I told you, he's got diabetes."
168681,L167251,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,I didn't eat any pizza.
168682,L166949,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,What about Howard?
168683,L166948,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"Hey, girls -- I was on television..."
168684,L166895,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,Howard!
168685,L166894,u4860,m324,MULVANEY,It's up to you ladies.
168686,L167552,u4862,m324,PAULINE,"No, that's all."
168687,L167551,u4861,m324,NEWSMAN,Do you remember anything else about Sal?
168688,L167550,u4862,m324,PAULINE,Yeah.
168689,L167549,u4861,m324,NEWSMAN,Did you always call him Junior.
168690,L167548,u4862,m324,PAULINE,"No, not until after they killed him."
168691,L167547,u4861,m324,NEWSMAN,Did you know he was a homosexual?
168692,L167546,u4862,m324,PAULINE,"Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place."
168693,L167545,u4861,m324,NEWSMAN,When was the last time you saw Sal?
168694,L167544,u4862,m324,PAULINE,It was on the TV.
168695,L167543,u4861,m324,NEWSMAN,How did you know your son was involved?
168696,L167147,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,Yes...
168697,L167146,u4863,m324,SAL,You gonna smoke the cigarette?
168698,L167145,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?"
168699,L167144,u4863,m324,SAL,"You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?"
168700,L167143,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,You're serious!
168701,L167142,u4863,m324,SAL,Your body is the temple of the Lord.
168702,L167141,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,My body?  What for?
168703,L167140,u4863,m324,SAL,Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
168704,L167139,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?"
168705,L167138,u4863,m324,SAL,You shouldn't start now.
168706,L167137,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,Pure?
168707,L167136,u4863,m324,SAL,No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
168708,L167135,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette."
168709,L167134,u4863,m324,SAL,Because I don't want cancer.
168710,L167133,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,You stopped?  Why?
168711,L167132,u4863,m324,SAL,"I used to, but I stopped."
168712,L167131,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?"
168713,L167130,u4863,m324,SAL,You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
168714,L167531,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Let's move it, goddamn it."
168715,L167530,u4863,m324,SAL,"Hey, Sonny - You did it!"
168716,L167520,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board."
168717,L167519,u4863,m324,SAL,I'm here.
168718,L167518,u4866,m324,SONNY,"There it is, Sal.  Sal?"
168719,L167502,u4866,m324,SONNY,All right.
168720,L167501,u4863,m324,SAL,"Okay, Sonny."
168721,L167500,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?"
168722,L167402,u4863,m324,SAL,Okay.
168723,L167401,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?"
168724,L167247,u4866,m324,SONNY,"He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?"
168725,L167246,u4863,m324,SAL,Why couldn't he talk about that here?
168726,L167245,u4866,m324,SONNY,He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
168727,L167244,u4863,m324,SAL,What'd he say?
168728,L167239,u4863,m324,SAL,They gotta stop sayin' that.
168729,L167238,u4866,m324,SONNY,Sal?
168730,L167226,u4863,m324,SAL,Have him walk in backwards.
168731,L167225,u4866,m324,SONNY,It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
168732,L167198,u4866,m324,SONNY,"That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them.  I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want.  Forget it.  It don't matter."
168733,L167197,u4863,m324,SAL,They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
168734,L167196,u4866,m324,SONNY,What?
168735,L167105,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they're movin' ... I also ordered some food ... I got some pizzas for us, all right?  I got some things to drink - I got sodas ... I even asked them for aspirins ... I'm doin' what I can ... now I gotta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills?"
168736,L167104,u4863,m324,SAL,Get over there!
168737,L167103,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay."
168738,L167066,u4863,m324,SAL,Everybody!  Back here!
168739,L167065,u4866,m324,SONNY,They're trying to come through the door!
168740,L167062,u4866,m324,SONNY,"It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ..."
168741,L167061,u4863,m324,SAL,I never been up in a plane before.
168742,L167060,u4866,m324,SONNY,Yeah ...
168743,L167059,u4863,m324,SAL,Sonny -
168744,L167010,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Wyoming ... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States ... Look, I'll be back."
168745,L167009,u4863,m324,SAL,Wyoming.
168746,L167008,u4866,m324,SONNY,"You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country."
168747,L166998,u4866,m324,SONNY,We're not there yet.
168748,L166997,u4863,m324,SAL,Does that still go?
168749,L166996,u4866,m324,SONNY,We'd kill ourselves.
168750,L166995,u4863,m324,SAL,"... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!"
168751,L166994,u4866,m324,SONNY,
168752,L166993,u4863,m324,SAL,What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
168753,L166992,u4866,m324,SONNY,Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
168754,L166991,u4863,m324,SAL,What kind of a deal?
168755,L166990,u4866,m324,SONNY,I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
168756,L166989,u4863,m324,SAL,
168757,L166988,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Okay, Sal ... what do we do?"
168758,L166898,u4866,m324,SONNY,All right ... let's go.
168759,L166897,u4863,m324,SAL,All right ... send them the guard.
168760,L166896,u4866,m324,SONNY,To show that we're negotiating.
168761,L166892,u4866,m324,SONNY,Alive.
168762,L166891,u4863,m324,SAL,Dead or alive?
168763,L166890,u4866,m324,SONNY,He wants one.
168764,L166827,u4863,m324,SAL,I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
168765,L166826,u4866,m324,SONNY,We won't have to.
168766,L166825,u4863,m324,SAL,But I want to know what you think.
168767,L166824,u4866,m324,SONNY,I want him to think that.
168768,L166823,u4863,m324,SAL,But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
168769,L166822,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?"
168770,L166821,u4863,m324,SAL,Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
168771,L166820,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this."
168772,L166798,u4863,m324,SAL,But do you mean it?
168773,L166797,u4866,m324,SONNY,I want him to think that.
168774,L166796,u4863,m324,SAL,... The bodies out the door.
168775,L166795,u4866,m324,SONNY,What?
168776,L166794,u4863,m324,SAL,You mean that?
168777,L166774,u4863,m324,SAL,How'd that happen?
168778,L166773,u4866,m324,SONNY,It's the cops.  Shit!
168779,L166757,u4866,m324,SONNY,Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?

168784,L166744,u4863,m324,SAL,He's gone?
168785,L166688,u4866,m324,SONNY,What are you crying for?  Jesus Christ.  It's not your fault there's no money...
168786,L166687,u4863,m324,SAL,"Let's go, Sonny."
168787,L166686,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Ah, Jesus..."
168788,L166656,u4863,m324,SAL,Fuck him - let him out!
168789,L166655,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it."
168790,L167527,u4865,m324,SHELDON,We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
168791,L167526,u4866,m324,SONNY,I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
168792,L167522,u4866,m324,SONNY,Okay.  Which one goes?
168793,L167521,u4865,m324,SHELDON,"That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal..."

168802,L167424,u4865,m324,SHELDON,"Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?"
168803,L167256,u4866,m324,SONNY,"The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad."
168804,L167255,u4865,m324,SHELDON,What's wrong?
168805,L167242,u4865,m324,SHELDON,What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.

168809,L167229,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards."
168810,L167228,u4865,m324,SHELDON,"I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to."
168811,L167227,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too."
168812,L167224,u4865,m324,SHELDON,I have to see.
168813,L167223,u4866,m324,SONNY,You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
168814,L167222,u4865,m324,SHELDON,"I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay."
168815,L167221,u4866,m324,SONNY,I want to talk to Leon.
168816,L167220,u4865,m324,SHELDON,I want them all.
168817,L167219,u4866,m324,SONNY,"At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one."
168818,L167218,u4865,m324,SHELDON,"Okay, when do I get them?"
168819,L167217,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive."
168820,L167216,u4865,m324,SHELDON,"I'd like to work with you on this, not against you."
168821,L167215,u4866,m324,SONNY,Bullshit!
168822,L167214,u4865,m324,SHELDON,I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.

168824,L167212,u4865,m324,SHELDON,"No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny."
168825,L167211,u4866,m324,SONNY,"First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning."
168826,L167510,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!"

168833,L167391,u4866,m324,SONNY,My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
168834,L167250,u4866,m324,SONNY,Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
168835,L167249,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
168836,L167248,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Hey, you okay?"
168837,L166781,u4866,m324,SONNY,... Just give me time to think...
168838,L166780,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
168839,L166779,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think."
168840,L166765,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on..."
168841,L166764,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,I forgot she's in here.
168842,L166763,u4866,m324,SONNY,What are you trying to pull?
168843,L166762,u4866,m324,SONNY,Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
168844,L166761,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,Oh - Maria!
168845,L166755,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
168846,L166754,u4866,m324,SONNY,What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
168847,L166753,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet."
168848,L166706,u4866,m324,SONNY,I speak what I feel.
168849,L166705,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,"Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language."
168850,L166695,u4866,m324,SONNY,Open this up!
168851,L166694,u4867,m324,SYLVIA,I am.
168852,L166693,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Okay, who's the head teller here?"
168853,L167457,u4866,m324,SONNY,He's right.  You shoulda done what he did.  Go home.  Don't talk to the FBI anymore.
168854,L167456,u4869,m324,VI,"No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son."
168855,L167455,u4866,m324,SONNY,Did Pop come down?
168856,L167454,u4869,m324,VI,No!
168857,L167453,u4866,m324,SONNY,"I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!"
168858,L167452,u4866,m324,SONNY,"Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you live on!  Maybe what?"
168859,L167451,u4869,m324,VI,Maybe...
168860,L167450,u4866,m324,SONNY,What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
168861,L167449,u4869,m324,VI,Oh.  Run.
168862,L167448,u4866,m324,SONNY,"I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them."

169183,L169799,u4892,m326,JADE,"Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way."
169184,L169798,u4887,m326,BUGGIN' OUT,"Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall."
169185,L169797,u4892,m326,JADE,Did you ask Sal?
169186,L169796,u4887,m326,BUGGIN' OUT,And I--we--want some Black people up.

169192,L169786,u4892,m326,JADE,What did he do this time?
169193,L169785,u4887,m326,BUGGIN' OUT,"Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria."
169194,L169784,u4892,m326,JADE,That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
169195,L170039,u4900,m326,SAL,It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
169196,L170038,u4887,m326,BUGGIN' OUT,Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
169197,L170037,u4900,m326,SAL,Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We ain't in Africa.
169198,L170036,u4887,m326,BUGGIN' OUT,"No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame."
169199,L170035,u4900,m326,SAL,What da fuck!  Are you deaf?

169204,L169446,u4900,m326,SAL,You a troublemaker?
169205,L169445,u4887,m326,BUGGIN' OUT,"Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say."
169206,L169436,u4887,m326,BUGGIN' OUT,Two dollars!  Forget it!
169207,L169435,u4900,m326,SAL,Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.

169212,L169782,u4887,m326,BUGGIN' OUT,It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
169213,L169566,u4887,m326,BUGGIN' OUT,No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
169214,L169565,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,"No, you the man."
169215,L169564,u4887,m326,BUGGIN' OUT,You the man.

169225,L169847,u4895,m326,ML,I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
169226,L169846,u4889,m326,COCONUT SID,Squash it.
169227,L169836,u4889,m326,COCONUT SID,I don't know how he does it.
169228,L169835,u4895,m326,ML,What can you say?

169230,L169776,u4895,m326,ML,No!
169231,L169627,u4895,m326,ML,"Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb."
169232,L169626,u4889,m326,COCONUT SID,How long?
169233,L169624,u4895,m326,ML,A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
169234,L169623,u4889,m326,COCONUT SID,It's been about a year.
169235,L169618,u4895,m326,ML,"OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down."
169236,L169617,u4889,m326,COCONUT SID,Make it plain.
169237,L169608,u4895,m326,ML,What was you saying?
169238,L169607,u4889,m326,COCONUT SID,As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
169239,L169425,u4895,m326,ML,"Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either."
169240,L169424,u4889,m326,COCONUT SID,You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
169241,L170101,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,We're still standing.
169242,L170100,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,I hope the block is still standing.
169243,L170099,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,I didn't.
169244,L170098,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,Where did you sleep?
169245,L170097,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,I've done that before.
169246,L170096,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
169247,L170095,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,Is it a good morning?
169248,L170094,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,Good morning.
169249,L169915,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,You're welcome.
169250,L169914,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,I thank you.
169251,L169913,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
169252,L169912,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,"I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often."
169253,L169911,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,"I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years."
169254,L169910,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,"That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life."
169255,L169496,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
169256,L169495,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,"Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know."
169257,L169494,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
169258,L169421,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,"One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil."
169259,L169420,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
169260,L169419,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
169261,L169418,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,You're a drunk fool.
169262,L169417,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,"Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?"
169263,L169416,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,The evil eye doesn't work on me.
169264,L169466,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,That's it.
169265,L169465,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,That's it?
169266,L169464,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,"Doctor, always try to do the right thing."
169267,L169463,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,OK.  OK.
169268,L169462,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,"Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'."
169269,L169461,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,"C'mere, Doctor."
169270,L169460,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,Gotta go.
169271,L169459,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,Mookie.
169272,L169647,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,You got a deal.
169273,L169646,u4891,m326,EDDIE,Fifty cents.
169274,L169645,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,"Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?"
169275,L169644,u4891,m326,EDDIE,How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
169276,L169643,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,"Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?"
169277,L169642,u4891,m326,EDDIE,I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
169278,L169641,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,What makes Sammy run?
169279,L169640,u4891,m326,EDDIE,My name is Eddie.
169280,L169639,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,What makes Sammy run?
169281,L169638,u4891,m326,EDDIE,Ten.
169282,L169637,u4890,m326,DA MAYOR,How old are you?
169283,L169636,u4891,m326,EDDIE,Eddie Lovell.
169284,L169899,u4892,m326,JADE,I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
169285,L169898,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
169286,L169897,u4892,m326,JADE,...peanuts.

169288,L169895,u4892,m326,JADE,"Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips..."
169289,L169894,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,One has nuthin' to do with the other.
169290,L169893,u4892,m326,JADE,"Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it."
169291,L169892,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,"I might be, but you're not welcome here."
169292,L169891,u4892,m326,JADE,You are too crude.
169293,L169890,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
169294,L169889,u4892,m326,JADE,I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
169295,L169888,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,Innocent!
169296,L169887,u4892,m326,JADE,He's completely innocent.
169297,L169886,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,Nice!
169298,L169885,u4892,m326,JADE,He's just being nice.
169299,L169884,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,"Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you."
169300,L169883,u4892,m326,JADE,What are you so worked up about?
169301,L169882,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,"No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips."
169302,L169881,u4892,m326,JADE,Stop tripping.
169303,L169880,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,"Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'."
169304,L169878,u4892,m326,JADE,See ya around.

169310,L169770,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,I'm coming.
169311,L169769,u4892,m326,JADE,Hurry up and get dressed.
169312,L169754,u4892,m326,JADE,I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
169313,L169753,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,What responsibilities?
169314,L169752,u4892,m326,JADE,"Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities."
169315,L169751,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
169316,L169750,u4892,m326,JADE,"I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is."
169317,L169749,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,"Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me."
169318,L169748,u4892,m326,JADE,"I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work."
169319,L169747,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,"Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me."
169320,L169746,u4892,m326,JADE,Sal's gonna be mad.
169321,L169745,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,I just come home to take a quick shower.
169322,L169744,u4892,m326,JADE,Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
169323,L169743,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,I'm working.
169324,L169742,u4892,m326,JADE,How come you're not at Sal's?
169325,L169741,u4892,m326,JADE,I'm in here.

169330,L169336,u4892,m326,JADE,"Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here."
169331,L169335,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,It's gonna be hot today.
169332,L169334,u4892,m326,JADE,Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
169333,L169333,u4896,m326,MOOKIE,Wake up!
169334,L169332,u4892,m326,JADE,Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
169335,L169502,u4892,m326,JADE,Whew!
169336,L169501,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,"And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people."
169337,L169500,u4892,m326,JADE,And move to Long Island...
169338,L169499,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,"Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it."
169339,L169498,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,"I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul."
169340,L169497,u4892,m326,JADE,"You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right."
169341,L169493,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
169342,L169492,u4892,m326,JADE,I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
169343,L169491,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,I'll do.
169344,L169490,u4892,m326,JADE,How are you holding up in this weather?
169345,L169489,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,"Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman."
169346,L169488,u4892,m326,JADE,"Sorry, comb got caught."
169347,L169487,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
169348,L169486,u4892,m326,JADE,"Yeah, me too."
169349,L169485,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
169350,L169484,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
169351,L169483,u4892,m326,JADE,This might take some time.
169352,L169481,u4892,m326,JADE,"I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?"
169353,L169480,u4897,m326,MOTHER SISTER,"Jade, you're late."

169720,L173022,u4906,m327,HARRY,O'clock?
169721,L173021,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Come over around seven.
169722,L173020,u4906,m327,HARRY,Excuse me?
169723,L173019,u4907,m327,JESSICA,You and Lloyd chose the class!?
169724,L173018,u4906,m327,HARRY,We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
169725,L173017,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special"
169726,L173016,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?"
169727,L173015,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate..."
169728,L173014,u4906,m327,HARRY,Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
169729,L173013,u4907,m327,JESSICA,You did?
169730,L173012,u4906,m327,HARRY,A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
169731,L173011,u4907,m327,JESSICA,That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
169732,L173010,u4906,m327,HARRY,MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
169733,L173009,u4907,m327,JESSICA,HARRY!
169734,L172895,u4907,m327,JESSICA,A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
169735,L172894,u4906,m327,HARRY,Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
169736,L172891,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class."
169737,L172890,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?"
169738,L172886,u4906,m327,HARRY,Heddo Jeth-ica.
169739,L172885,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Hey guys.
169740,L172636,u4906,m327,HARRY,HARRY Dunne.
169741,L172635,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews."
169742,L172634,u4906,m327,HARRY,Four colors? Neato!
169743,L172633,u4907,m327,JESSICA,I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
169744,L172632,u4906,m327,HARRY,Yeah. How'd you know?
169745,L172631,u4907,m327,JESSICA,You're the kid who was home schooled.
169746,L172630,u4906,m327,HARRY,Depends how you define 'new'...
169747,L172629,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?"
169748,L172628,u4906,m327,HARRY,In the new library there.
169749,L172627,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Excuse me.
169750,L172626,u4906,m327,HARRY,Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
169751,L172625,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Hi.
169752,L173115,u4906,m327,HARRY,Famous? I've never heard of it.
169753,L173114,u4908,m327,JESSICA'S DAD,Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
169754,L173113,u4906,m327,HARRY,"No, I'm fine thanks."
169755,L173112,u4908,m327,JESSICA'S DAD,We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
169756,L173106,u4906,m327,HARRY,Well la de da.
169757,L173105,u4908,m327,JESSICA'S DAD,The name's Walter.
169758,L173104,u4906,m327,HARRY,Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
169759,L173103,u4908,m327,JESSICA'S DAD,Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
169760,L172742,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,"So boys, how was your first day?"
169761,L172741,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!"
169762,L172740,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,"Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up."
169763,L172737,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,"LLOYD, did you ask your parents?"
169764,L172736,u4906,m327,HARRY,Is it okay if he spends the night?
169765,L172735,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,"Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend."
169766,L172574,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,Right.
169767,L172573,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Mom, you know that never works."
169768,L172571,u4906,m327,HARRY,Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
169769,L172570,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
169770,L172569,u4906,m327,HARRY,"I know I am, Mom."
169771,L172568,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,"You're going to be just fine, HARRY."
169772,L172567,u4906,m327,HARRY,"You know Mom, like in the pool."
169773,L172566,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,I don't follow.
169774,L172565,u4906,m327,HARRY,Wow just like Marco Polo.
169775,L172564,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
169776,L172563,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?"
169777,L172561,u4906,m327,HARRY,I'm just not ready.
169778,L172560,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,"Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age..."
169779,L172559,u4906,m327,HARRY,Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
169780,L173519,u4906,m327,HARRY,I know.
169781,L173518,u4910,m327,LLOYD,That's gross.
169782,L173517,u4906,m327,HARRY,Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
169783,L173516,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Hey, where'd you go?"
169784,L173515,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Sorry, Charlie."
169785,L173509,u4906,m327,HARRY,No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
169786,L173508,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You take her.
169787,L173507,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Well, what should we do?"
169788,L173506,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Try one in a million!
169789,L173505,u4906,m327,HARRY,She's one of a kind.
169790,L173504,u4910,m327,LLOYD,That's the one I wanted.
169791,L173503,u4906,m327,HARRY,What?
169792,L173502,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Damn! What are the odds?
169793,L173501,u4906,m327,HARRY,The one on the left.
169794,L173500,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Okay. Which one do you want?
169795,L173499,u4906,m327,HARRY,Right.
169796,L173498,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?"
169797,L173492,u4910,m327,LLOYD,I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
169798,L173491,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again."
169799,L173490,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women."
169800,L173489,u4910,m327,LLOYD,And with that complete loser
169801,L173488,u4906,m327,HARRY,Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
169802,L173478,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Well, that's too bad, this is his day."
169803,L173477,u4910,m327,LLOYD,He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
169804,L173476,u4906,m327,HARRY,Hey there goes Principal Collins!
169805,L173474,u4910,m327,LLOYD,How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
169806,L173473,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Oh, good. There's Jessica."
169807,L173467,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Roger that, Wilco."
169808,L173466,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Start the tape, Lloyd."
169809,L173438,u4906,m327,HARRY,"You're a great teacher, Lloyd."
169810,L173437,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
169811,L173436,u4906,m327,HARRY,Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
169812,L173433,u4910,m327,LLOYD,PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
169813,L173432,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Guys, this is much better."
169814,L173418,u4906,m327,HARRY,"LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want."
169815,L173417,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?"
169816,L173416,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Wait, wait!"
169817,L173413,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started."
169818,L173412,u4906,m327,HARRY,Ready Lloyd?
169819,L173411,u4906,m327,HARRY,Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
169820,L173410,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!"
169821,L173409,u4906,m327,HARRY,That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
169822,L173408,u4910,m327,LLOYD,A float!
169823,L173407,u4906,m327,HARRY,"And like she said, do it before the parade."
169824,L173406,u4910,m327,LLOYD,She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
169825,L173405,u4906,m327,HARRY,That's what Jessica was talking about!
169826,L173404,u4910,m327,LLOYD,We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
169827,L173403,u4906,m327,HARRY,What? What did we do?
169828,L173400,u4906,m327,HARRY,Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
169829,L173399,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
169830,L173398,u4906,m327,HARRY,What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
169831,L173390,u4906,m327,HARRY,That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
169832,L173389,u4910,m327,LLOYD,That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
169833,L173386,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
169834,L173385,u4906,m327,HARRY,Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
169835,L173382,u4906,m327,HARRY,Do you know what this means?
169836,L173381,u4910,m327,LLOYD,I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
169837,L173380,u4906,m327,HARRY,I don't know who we are anymore.
169838,L173379,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
169839,L173378,u4910,m327,LLOYD,It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
169840,L173377,u4906,m327,HARRY,I... found that rock.
169841,L173376,u4910,m327,LLOYD,But I ate your Mom's pie.
169842,L173375,u4906,m327,HARRY,I made the polar bear pants.
169843,L173374,u4910,m327,LLOYD,I lugged it all over town!
169844,L173373,u4906,m327,HARRY,But my mom gave me the map.
169845,L173372,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it."
169846,L173371,u4906,m327,HARRY,"You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship."
169847,L173354,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape."
169848,L173353,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Well, I'm listening now."
169849,L173352,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
169850,L173351,u4906,m327,HARRY,You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
169851,L173332,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You thinking what I'm thinking?
169852,L173331,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Hey, look. Ice cream."
169853,L173330,u4910,m327,LLOYD,He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
169854,L173329,u4906,m327,HARRY,Cute puppy.
169855,L173322,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Hey, let's go spy on them."
169856,L173321,u4910,m327,LLOYD,He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
169857,L173320,u4906,m327,HARRY,No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
169858,L173319,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.
169859,L173318,u4906,m327,HARRY,PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
169860,L173317,u4910,m327,LLOYD,That must be her boyfriend's car.
169861,L173316,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Hey, it's Jessica."
169862,L173315,u4910,m327,LLOYD,No. Look.
169863,L173314,u4906,m327,HARRY,It's okay. I want the rush.
169864,L173313,u4910,m327,LLOYD,D2.
169865,L173312,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Are, too."
169866,L173311,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Am not.
169867,L173310,u4906,m327,HARRY,You're it.
169868,L173292,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Sorry, no further questions."
169869,L173291,u4906,m327,HARRY,I know I did.
169870,L173290,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You certainly did.
169871,L173289,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Yeah, that's why I asked."
169872,L173288,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"If you have to ask, you don't know."
169873,L173287,u4906,m327,HARRY,"What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be ""it""."
169874,L173286,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward."
169875,L173266,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Hello, he only invented money!"
169876,L173265,u4906,m327,HARRY,Who?
169877,L173264,u4910,m327,LLOYD,George Washington!
169878,L173253,u4910,m327,LLOYD,A turd.
169879,L173252,u4906,m327,HARRY,A blimp.
169880,L173251,u4910,m327,LLOYD,A raft.
169881,L173231,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?"
169882,L173230,u4906,m327,HARRY,No. What happened?
169883,L173229,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?"
169884,L173206,u4910,m327,LLOYD,The answer is George Jefferson.
169885,L173205,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Me, me, me!"
169886,L173204,u4910,m327,LLOYD,No one knows?
169887,L173201,u4906,m327,HARRY,You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
169888,L173200,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?"
169889,L173199,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one."
169890,L173198,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what."
169891,L173197,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!"
169892,L173196,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink."
169893,L173195,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Captain Rob came back?
169894,L173194,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Do you hear something, Captain Rob?"
169895,L173193,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend."
169896,L173192,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your ""girlfriend""?"
169897,L173191,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
169898,L173190,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Go away, assface."
169899,L173189,u4910,m327,LLOYD,HARRY! I found the treasure!
169900,L173165,u4906,m327,HARRY,"You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom."
169901,L173164,u4910,m327,LLOYD,HARRY!
169902,L173163,u4906,m327,HARRY,But-
169903,L173162,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible."
169904,L173161,u4906,m327,HARRY,"LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom."
169905,L173118,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"So, have you given him ""some"" yet?"
169906,L173117,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones."
169907,L173102,u4906,m327,HARRY,"What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?"
169908,L173101,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?"
169909,L173100,u4906,m327,HARRY,Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
169910,L173099,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
169911,L173097,u4906,m327,HARRY,I bet you want your head scratched.
169912,L173096,u4910,m327,LLOYD,I bet you want your head scratched.
169913,L173095,u4906,m327,HARRY,Do you want me to pet your head?
169914,L173092,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Hey, where did you come from?"
169915,L173091,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Hey, where did you come from?"
169916,L173089,u4906,m327,HARRY,You have beautiful eyes.
169917,L173088,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You have beautiful eyes.
169918,L173083,u4906,m327,HARRY,Yes.
169919,L173082,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"HARRY, can you hear me?"
169920,L173079,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes."
169921,L173078,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say."
169922,L173077,u4906,m327,HARRY,"She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her."
169923,L173076,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You're always your harshest critic.
169924,L173075,u4906,m327,HARRY,I don't think so.
169925,L173074,u4910,m327,LLOYD,I'm sure you're overreacting.
169926,L173073,u4906,m327,HARRY,I kinda screwed things up.
169927,L173072,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Just wanted to see how your doing.
169928,L173071,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?"
169929,L173037,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate."
169930,L173036,u4906,m327,HARRY,Shut up!
169931,L173035,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision."
169932,L173034,u4906,m327,HARRY,You can't marry my mom.
169933,L173033,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Sure I do. On one condition.
169934,L173032,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to."
169935,L173031,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it."
169936,L173030,u4906,m327,HARRY,Some what?
169937,L173029,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get ""some""."
169938,L173028,u4906,m327,HARRY,"I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means."
169939,L173027,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
169940,L173026,u4906,m327,HARRY,Yea!
169941,L173025,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?"
169942,L172997,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now."
169943,L172996,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"That's a cow, Harry."
169944,L172993,u4910,m327,LLOYD,I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
169945,L172992,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment."
169946,L172991,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"You and me? Dream on, desperado."
169947,L172990,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?"
169948,L172989,u4910,m327,LLOYD,I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
169949,L172988,u4906,m327,HARRY,Who's your partner?
169950,L172987,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Sucks for you.
169951,L172986,u4906,m327,HARRY,Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
169952,L172944,u4906,m327,HARRY,Wanna bet?
169953,L172943,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Nope. I was right.
169954,L172941,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!"
169955,L172940,u4906,m327,HARRY,How do you know it's for us?
169956,L172939,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Our own special bus.
169957,L172938,u4906,m327,HARRY,What?
169958,L172936,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure."
169959,L172935,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"According to the map, we're just about at school."
169960,L172919,u4910,m327,LLOYD,HARRY! Here he comes.
169961,L172918,u4906,m327,HARRY,Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
169962,L172917,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!"
169963,L172916,u4906,m327,HARRY,...cause you said...
169964,L172915,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
169965,L172914,u4906,m327,HARRY,"LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed."
169966,L172897,u4910,m327,LLOYD,What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
169967,L172896,u4906,m327,HARRY,"There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear."
169968,L172884,u4910,m327,LLOYD,And my mouph is frozen.
169969,L172883,u4906,m327,HARRY,Owww.
169970,L172882,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Put some ice on it.
169971,L172881,u4906,m327,HARRY,My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
169972,L172880,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
169973,L172879,u4906,m327,HARRY,I don't know. Owwww.
169974,L172878,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?"
169975,L172877,u4906,m327,HARRY,Owww... refreshing.
169976,L172876,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me."
169977,L172875,u4906,m327,HARRY,"These are really cold, huh?"
169978,L172874,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong."
169979,L172873,u4906,m327,HARRY,Can he do that?
169980,L172859,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
169981,L172858,u4906,m327,HARRY,You're it.
169982,L172855,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again."
169983,L172854,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You're it.
169984,L172852,u4910,m327,LLOYD,They can't be real.
169985,L172851,u4906,m327,HARRY,Nice jugs.
169986,L172849,u4910,m327,LLOYD,And he invented fire.
169987,L172848,u4906,m327,HARRY,A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
169988,L172847,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?"
169989,L172846,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?"
169990,L172845,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Welcome to public school, my friend."
169991,L172844,u4906,m327,HARRY,I didn't know that.
169992,L172843,u4910,m327,LLOYD,The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
169993,L172842,u4906,m327,HARRY,...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
169994,L172815,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Don't look directly at him.
169995,L172814,u4906,m327,HARRY,"What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?"
169996,L172813,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
169997,L172812,u4906,m327,HARRY,No.
169998,L172811,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
169999,L172810,u4906,m327,HARRY,HARRY.
170000,L172801,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Now you see why he was elected principal?
170001,L172800,u4906,m327,HARRY,Collins is a great man!
170002,L172793,u4906,m327,HARRY,Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
170003,L172792,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night."
170004,L172784,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Kids.
170005,L172783,u4906,m327,HARRY,I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
170006,L172782,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Where did you learn that word?
170007,L172781,u4906,m327,HARRY,Shut Up! Buttlick!
170008,L172780,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You take that back!
170009,L172779,u4906,m327,HARRY,You're not my real dad.
170010,L172778,u4910,m327,LLOYD,I will stop this car right now.
170011,L172777,u4906,m327,HARRY,Shut up!
170012,L172776,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Don't use that tone with me, young man."
170013,L172775,u4906,m327,HARRY,Will not.
170014,L172774,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say."
170015,L172773,u4906,m327,HARRY,"LLOYD, she's my mom."
170016,L172772,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
170017,L172771,u4906,m327,HARRY,She did not.
170018,L172770,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Your mom made a move on me.
170019,L172769,u4906,m327,HARRY,What?
170020,L172768,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Whoa. What was that?
170021,L172761,u4910,m327,LLOYD,A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
170022,L172760,u4906,m327,HARRY,"If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin."
170023,L172759,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Exactly! A pirate!
170024,L172758,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Yeah, go-cart accident."
170025,L172757,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Peg leg?
170026,L172756,u4906,m327,HARRY,"I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says ""yo ho ho"" has a peg leg..."
170027,L172755,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Yeah, he's a pirate."
170028,L172754,u4906,m327,HARRY,"What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure..."
170029,L172753,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Sounds like a pirate.
170030,L172752,u4906,m327,HARRY,"No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand..."
170031,L172751,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge..."
170032,L172750,u4906,m327,HARRY,Just a guy I hang out with.
170033,L172749,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Who's Captain Rob?
170034,L172748,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob."
170035,L172744,u4906,m327,HARRY,Go fish.
170036,L172743,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Got any crazy eights?
170037,L172728,u4910,m327,LLOYD,JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.
170038,L172727,u4906,m327,HARRY,Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
170039,L172721,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Now that's more of what we're looking for.
170040,L172720,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed."
170041,L172715,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong."
170042,L172714,u4906,m327,HARRY,"...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells..."
170043,L172708,u4910,m327,LLOYD,And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
170044,L172707,u4906,m327,HARRY,"We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking."
170045,L172704,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You brave soldier.
170046,L172703,u4906,m327,HARRY,One day they'll find a cure.
170047,L172699,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Oh, of course."
170048,L172698,u4906,m327,HARRY,The second R is silent.
170049,L172697,u4910,m327,LLOYD,H A R R Y...
170050,L172696,u4906,m327,HARRY,It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
170051,L172695,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs."
170052,L172694,u4906,m327,HARRY,Can we eat there tomorrow?
170053,L172693,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new."
170054,L172692,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Oh, is this your special place?"
170055,L172691,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"You know, you're the first person I've brought here."
170056,L172687,u4906,m327,HARRY,Wow.
170057,L172686,u4910,m327,LLOYD,The principal.
170058,L172685,u4906,m327,HARRY,Who's Principal Collins?
170059,L172683,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Shift to your left.
170060,L172682,u4906,m327,HARRY,"God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly."
170061,L172681,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!"
170062,L172680,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great."
170063,L172679,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day."
170064,L172621,u4906,m327,HARRY,Me too!
170065,L172620,u4910,m327,LLOYD,How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
170066,L172619,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!"
170067,L172617,u4906,m327,HARRY,No.
170068,L172616,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?"
170069,L172615,u4906,m327,HARRY,Why not?
170070,L172614,u4910,m327,LLOYD,No no no no no.
170071,L172613,u4906,m327,HARRY,Don't we want them to talk to us?
170072,L172612,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you."
170073,L172607,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You're it.
170074,L172606,u4906,m327,HARRY,What?
170075,L172605,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that ""X"". But... I do know something."
170076,L172604,u4906,m327,HARRY,My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
170077,L172603,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Cool.
170078,L172602,u4906,m327,HARRY,"No, it's a treasure map."
170079,L172601,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Is that what I think it is?
170080,L172600,u4906,m327,HARRY,I think it's just over there.
170081,L172599,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Me too!
170082,L172598,u4906,m327,HARRY,I go to school where I live.
170083,L172597,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Home school? What's that?
170084,L172596,u4906,m327,HARRY,Home school. Til today.
170085,L172595,u4910,m327,LLOYD,I haven't seen you around here before.
170086,L172594,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!"
170087,L172593,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas."
170088,L172592,u4906,m327,HARRY,Probably because we've never met.
170089,L172591,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?"
170090,L172590,u4906,m327,HARRY,"Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne."
170091,L172589,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
170092,L172588,u4906,m327,HARRY,That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
170093,L172587,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
170094,L172954,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
170095,L172953,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special."
170096,L172952,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,I thought I told you to get lost.
170097,L172933,u4907,m327,JESSICA,You mean the lunch room?
170098,L172932,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
170099,L172931,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
170100,L172930,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Oh, you're good."
170101,L172929,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Are you wearing a coconut bra?
170102,L172928,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,No.
170103,L172927,u4907,m327,JESSICA,So can I come along?
170104,L172926,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera."
170105,L172925,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy."
170106,L172924,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
170107,L172923,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class."
170108,L173340,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league."
170109,L173339,u4907,m327,JESSICA,THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
170110,L173338,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Then where did you get this not my tape.
170111,L173337,u4907,m327,JESSICA,That's not your tape.
170112,L173336,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape."
170113,L173335,u4907,m327,JESSICA,I don't know what you're talking about.
170114,L173334,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?"
170115,L173328,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Not to expect you tonight.
170116,L173327,u4907,m327,JESSICA,So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
170117,L173284,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear."
170118,L173283,u4907,m327,JESSICA,My parents are going to wonder where I am.
170119,L173282,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Oh I think you do.
170120,L173281,u4907,m327,JESSICA,I don't know what you're talking about.
170121,L173280,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?"
170122,L173279,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
170123,L173278,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,You had some questions.
170124,L172949,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student."
170125,L172948,u4919,m327,TURK,You're just jealous.
170126,L172947,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
170127,L172946,u4919,m327,TURK,Special Needs class.
170128,L172945,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"TURK, what are you doing here?"
170129,L172642,u4919,m327,TURK,"TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too."
170130,L172641,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"TURK, leave him alone."
170131,L173484,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
170132,L173483,u4907,m327,JESSICA,He's going to be in jail for a long time.
170133,L173369,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"""My dream date with Principal Collins."""
170134,L173368,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of."
170135,L173350,u4910,m327,LLOYD,HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
170136,L173349,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?"
170137,L173348,u4910,m327,LLOYD,... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
170138,L173343,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Looks like the best man won.
170139,L173342,u4907,m327,JESSICA,HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
170140,L173185,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here."
170141,L173184,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
170142,L173183,u4907,m327,JESSICA,That's my boyfriend.
170143,L173182,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone."
170144,L173181,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"No, it was a complete waste of time."
170145,L173180,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?"
170146,L173179,u4907,m327,JESSICA,That's it. I'm done.
170147,L173178,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Me too. I'm almost there.
170148,L173177,u4907,m327,JESSICA,I'm so close I can feel it.
170149,L173175,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Let's just do it and get out of here.
170150,L173174,u4910,m327,LLOYD,What are you doing?
170151,L173172,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?"
170152,L173171,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it."
170153,L173170,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
170154,L173169,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Well, something stinks."
170155,L173146,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Oh, go on."
170156,L173145,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Oh, baby, you're the bestest."
170157,L173138,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Tomorrow night?
170158,L173137,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"So, when can we do it?"
170159,L173126,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that."
170160,L173125,u4907,m327,JESSICA,So could you get us into the principal's office?
170161,L173124,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school."
170162,L173123,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
170163,L173122,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"I know, you want go for a ride."
170164,L173121,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something."
170165,L173120,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"You know, ""some"". The fag stuff."
170166,L173119,u4907,m327,JESSICA,What?
170167,L173111,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up."
170168,L173110,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Checking up on my friend, Harry."
170169,L173109,u4907,m327,JESSICA,What are you doing here?
170170,L173094,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Do you want me to pet your head?
170171,L173093,u4907,m327,JESSICA,Well I was born in St. Louis.
170172,L173085,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Don't answer me. Say what I say.
170173,L173084,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Yes, what?"
170174,L172893,u4907,m327,JESSICA,This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.

170176,L172889,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys."
170177,L172888,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late."
170178,L172887,u4907,m327,JESSICA,"HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class."
170179,L172644,u4907,m327,JESSICA,I'll talk to you later.
170180,L172643,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!"
170181,L173221,u4909,m327,LEWIS,What are you talking about?
170182,L173220,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"So I'm an ""arrrrrs-hole"", eh Captain Rob?"
170183,L173219,u4909,m327,LEWIS,Can you believe it?
170184,L173218,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You really are a pirate.
170185,L173217,u4909,m327,LEWIS,"I don't know if you'd call us ""friends""..."
170186,L173216,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?"
170187,L173215,u4909,m327,LEWIS,Duh. I'm in your class at school.
170188,L173214,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Do I know you?
170189,L172723,u4910,m327,LLOYD,You were born free and free you should remain.
170190,L172722,u4909,m327,LEWIS,Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
170191,L172712,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"You can bring whatever you want, little friend."
170192,L172711,u4918,m327,TOBY,Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
170193,L172710,u4910,m327,LLOYD,That's the downside. There is none.
170194,L172709,u4918,m327,TOBY,How much homework is there?
170195,L172706,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
170196,L172705,u4918,m327,TOBY,"What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks."
170197,L172702,u4918,m327,TOBY,Skateboard.
170198,L172701,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?"
170199,L173300,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Uh-oh. Harry?
170200,L173299,u4917,m327,TEN YEAR-OLD KID,Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
170201,L173298,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Ha! I said ""doll-hairs."" Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go."
170202,L173297,u4917,m327,TEN YEAR-OLD KID,"Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars."
170203,L173296,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Do we have a deal?
170204,L173295,u4917,m327,TEN YEAR-OLD KID,Okay.
170205,L173294,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Go in there and get us two slushees.
170206,L173293,u4917,m327,TEN YEAR-OLD KID,Sure.
170207,L173160,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets..."
170208,L173159,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,How was that?
170209,L173152,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Oh yeah, give it to me."
170210,L173151,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,You know I do!
170211,L173150,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Have you got what I want?
170212,L173149,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,"Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world."
170213,L173148,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
170214,L172764,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Hey can be on top?
170215,L172763,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,Hey you two. Lights out.
170216,L172734,u4910,m327,LLOYD,I liked it a lot.
170217,L172733,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
170218,L172732,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Well he missed a great pot of stew!
170219,L172731,u4913,m327,MRS. DUNNE,He passed away three years ago.
170220,L172730,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?"
170221,L172826,u4916,m327,RAY,I reckon so.
170222,L172825,u4910,m327,LLOYD,So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
170223,L172824,u4916,m327,RAY,"My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different."
170224,L172823,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"We're not crazy. We're ""special"". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!"
170225,L172822,u4916,m327,RAY,What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
170226,L172817,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!"
170227,L172816,u4916,m327,RAY,"LLOYD, may I see you a minute?"
170228,L172576,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Thanks, Pop."
170229,L172575,u4916,m327,RAY,"Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son."
170230,L173366,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?"
170231,L173365,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Obviously.
170232,L173268,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Or maybe crossing a river!
170233,L173267,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
170234,L173256,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"People! Come on. ""Parade"" float."
170235,L173255,u4910,m327,LLOYD,"Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching."
170236,L172690,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,No.
170237,L172689,u4910,m327,LLOYD,Will that be on the midterm?
170238,L172688,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
170239,L172976,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,What the hell are you talking about?
170240,L172975,u4911,m327,MARGIE,"Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke."
170241,L172974,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,I think you did it.
170242,L172973,u4911,m327,MARGIE,"No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide."
170243,L172972,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Ha! Too big to make the turn!
170244,L172971,u4911,m327,MARGIE,"You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history."
170245,L172970,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Left here! Left!
170246,L172969,u4911,m327,MARGIE,"Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless."
170247,L172968,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"That's great, now make a left, then straight!"
170248,L172964,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!"
170249,L172963,u4911,m327,MARGIE,He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
170250,L172962,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,What?
170251,L172961,u4911,m327,MARGIE,Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
170252,L172960,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!"
170253,L172957,u4911,m327,MARGIE,"Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art."
170254,L172956,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
170255,L173463,u4920,m327,ZIMMER,But we don't drink from the house do we.
170256,L173462,u4912,m327,MOFFIT,I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
170257,L173461,u4920,m327,ZIMMER,Yes you are.
170258,L173460,u4912,m327,MOFFIT,I am strong!
170259,L173450,u4912,m327,MOFFIT,"Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine."
170260,L173449,u4920,m327,ZIMMER,"Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well..."
170261,L173448,u4912,m327,MOFFIT,I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
170262,L173447,u4920,m327,ZIMMER,"Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap."
170263,L173446,u4912,m327,MOFFIT,Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
170264,L173445,u4920,m327,ZIMMER,I'm not sure if I can do this.
170265,L173427,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse."
170266,L173426,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,This is horse?
170267,L173425,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
170268,L173424,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Love it!
170269,L173423,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?"
170270,L173422,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,This band sounds terrible.
170271,L173421,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything."
170272,L173420,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,So the chest is still out there somewhere.
170273,L173249,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
170274,L173248,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Are you going to kill her?
170275,L173247,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"Okay, I'll take care of Jessica."
170276,L173246,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions."
170277,L173245,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,JESSICA. Are you sure?
170278,L173244,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
170279,L173243,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
170280,L173242,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it."
170281,L173241,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
170282,L173240,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Where is it?
170283,L173239,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
170284,L173238,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,The evidence of what?
170285,L173237,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
170286,L173236,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,What papers?
170287,L173235,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
170288,L173234,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?"
170289,L172913,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Just like the President.
170290,L172912,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Oh, just like the President."
170291,L172911,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Everything. Just for the record.
170292,L172910,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Everything?
170293,L172909,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office."
170294,L172908,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,So what do you keep in there?
170295,L172906,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true."
170296,L172905,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand."
170297,L172904,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,You got the Extender?
170298,L172903,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Well I've got a little surprise for you.
170299,L172902,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,It's a surprise.
170300,L172901,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,What?
170301,L172900,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Guess what""s under these coconuts."
170302,L172899,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Who's there?
170303,L172898,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Knock knock.
170304,L172806,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,And you are great in bed.
170305,L172805,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Wow, you are smart."
170306,L172804,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"And, take some more pictures."
170307,L172803,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,And...?
170308,L172802,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
170309,L172790,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Yes!
170310,L172789,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
170311,L172677,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,I think you'll make a good teacher.
170312,L172676,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Times two.
170313,L172674,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,Oh wow. Look at you.
170314,L172673,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Aloha means hello and goodbye.
170315,L172672,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"You said ""aloha"" twice."
170316,L172671,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather."
170317,L172670,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,We start our own class?
170318,L172669,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class."
170319,L172668,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!"
170320,L172667,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class."
170321,L172665,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this."
170322,L172664,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,It's the big potato.
170323,L172663,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
170324,L172662,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
170325,L172661,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki."
170326,L172650,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,And I you.
170327,L172649,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"God, I've missed you."
170328,L172648,u4915,m327,PRINCIPAL COLLINS,"Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good."
170329,L172647,u4914,m327,MS. HELLER,"... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are ""South of the Border"" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla."
170330,L173879,u4921,m328,BARON,"You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!"
170331,L173878,u4930,m328,PITER,"The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I..."
170332,L173877,u4921,m328,BARON,It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
170333,L173682,u4921,m328,BARON,I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
170334,L173681,u4930,m328,PITER,"He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you."
170335,L173680,u4921,m328,BARON,"What does Leto say, Piter?"
170336,L173679,u4930,m328,PITER,"The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto."
170337,L173678,u4921,m328,BARON,Piter.
170338,L173677,u4930,m328,PITER,My Lord!
170339,L173811,u4926,m328,KYNES,Nothing.
170340,L173810,u4922,m328,DUKE LETO,What's that you're saying?
170341,L173792,u4926,m328,KYNES,The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
170342,L173791,u4922,m328,DUKE LETO,What happens now?
170343,L173765,u4926,m328,KYNES,With your permission...
170344,L173764,u4922,m328,DUKE LETO,My thanks.
170345,L173754,u4926,m328,KYNES,"They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord."
170346,L173753,u4922,m328,DUKE LETO,"I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor."
170347,L173749,u4922,m328,DUKE LETO,"This is my son, Paul."
170348,L173748,u4926,m328,KYNES,"I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born."
170349,L173747,u4922,m328,DUKE LETO,"So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?"
170350,L173540,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,We are alone...
170351,L173539,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,"Yes, my Lord."
170352,L173536,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,"I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord."
170353,L173535,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
170354,L173534,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
170355,L173533,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,Yes?
170356,L173532,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
170357,L173531,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
170358,L173530,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,We felt his presence.
170359,L173529,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
170360,L173561,u4928,m328,NAVIGATOR,Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
170361,L173560,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,I can assure you...
170362,L173557,u4928,m328,NAVIGATOR,"LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life."
170363,L173556,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
170364,L173552,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,Yes.
170365,L173551,u4928,m328,NAVIGATOR,So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
170366,L173550,u4928,m328,NAVIGATOR,"You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops."
170367,L173549,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,Yes.
170368,L173548,u4928,m328,NAVIGATOR,"I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it."
170369,L173544,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
170370,L173543,u4928,m328,NAVIGATOR,Many machines on Ix... new machines.
170371,L173542,u4923,m328,EMPEROR,Yes?... How was your journey?
170372,L173541,u4928,m328,NAVIGATOR,We have just folded space from Ix...
170373,L173784,u4926,m328,KYNES,"That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice."
170374,L173783,u4924,m328,GURNEY,"Dust cloud ahead, Sire."
170375,L173762,u4926,m328,KYNES,"It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes."
170376,L173761,u4924,m328,GURNEY,"Yes, Sire."
170377,L173759,u4924,m328,GURNEY,Sire!
170378,L173758,u4926,m328,KYNES,Basically...
170379,L173757,u4924,m328,GURNEY,"The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps."
170380,L173745,u4926,m328,KYNES,Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
170381,L173744,u4924,m328,GURNEY,"I hope I made myself clear. You may call him ""The Duke,"" ""My lord,"" or ""Sire."" And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- ""Noble Born."""
170382,L173743,u4926,m328,KYNES,"So, this is Leto the Just..."
170383,L174130,u4929,m328,PAUL,The Emperor's blade.
170384,L174129,u4924,m328,GURNEY,"This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord."
170385,L174102,u4929,m328,PAUL,Let him stand free!
170386,L174101,u4924,m328,GURNEY,My Lord?
170387,L174100,u4929,m328,PAUL,Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
170388,L174043,u4924,m328,GURNEY,They said you were dead.  They said...
170389,L174042,u4929,m328,PAUL,Don't you trust your own eyes.
170390,L174041,u4924,m328,GURNEY,Paul!!  Paul!!
170391,L174040,u4929,m328,PAUL,You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
170392,L173590,u4924,m328,GURNEY,"Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real."
170393,L173589,u4929,m328,PAUL,Things have been so serious here lately.
170394,L173588,u4924,m328,GURNEY,If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
170395,L173587,u4929,m328,PAUL,Would you really have drawn my blood?
170396,L173586,u4924,m328,GURNEY,"We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the ""mood""."
170397,L173585,u4924,m328,GURNEY,Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
170398,L173584,u4929,m328,PAUL,Is this what you seek?
170399,L173583,u4929,m328,PAUL,"What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck."
170400,L173581,u4924,m328,GURNEY,Not sorry enough.
170401,L173580,u4929,m328,PAUL,I'm sorry Gurney.
170402,L173579,u4924,m328,GURNEY,Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
170403,L173578,u4929,m328,PAUL,Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
170404,L173577,u4924,m328,GURNEY,No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
170405,L173972,u4925,m328,JESSICA,"I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?"
170406,L173971,u4932,m328,STILGAR,Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
170407,L173970,u4925,m328,JESSICA,"They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within."
170408,L173969,u4932,m328,STILGAR,Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
170409,L173941,u4925,m328,JESSICA,Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
170410,L173940,u4932,m328,STILGAR,Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
170411,L173939,u4932,m328,STILGAR,"I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline."
170412,L173938,u4925,m328,JESSICA,"No, but many consider my training valuable."
170413,L173937,u4932,m328,STILGAR,Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
170414,L173936,u4932,m328,STILGAR,Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
170415,L173738,u4927,m328,MAPES,"My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock."

170417,L173736,u4925,m328,JESSICA,"Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker..."
170418,L173735,u4927,m328,MAPES,Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
170419,L173734,u4925,m328,JESSICA,It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
170420,L173733,u4927,m328,MAPES,Do you know this my lady?
170421,L173730,u4925,m328,JESSICA,That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
170422,L173729,u4927,m328,MAPES,As the legend says.
170423,L173728,u4925,m328,JESSICA,"I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages."
170424,L173727,u4927,m328,MAPES,You know the ancient tongues?
170425,L174120,u4929,m328,PAUL,You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
170426,L174119,u4925,m328,JESSICA,Stop him yourself.
170427,L173935,u4929,m328,PAUL,Yes...

170430,L173932,u4925,m328,JESSICA,What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
170431,L173929,u4929,m328,PAUL,I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
170432,L173928,u4925,m328,JESSICA,Yes...
170433,L173927,u4929,m328,PAUL,Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
170434,L173925,u4925,m328,JESSICA,I can't... I can't.
170435,L173924,u4929,m328,PAUL,Run!
170436,L173921,u4925,m328,JESSICA,I'm ready.
170437,L173920,u4929,m328,PAUL,Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
170438,L173919,u4925,m328,JESSICA,...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
170439,L173918,u4929,m328,PAUL,"It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them."
170440,L173910,u4929,m328,PAUL,"You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me..."
170441,L173909,u4925,m328,JESSICA,He knows.
170442,L173908,u4929,m328,PAUL,You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
170443,L173907,u4925,m328,JESSICA,Is he....?
170444,L173906,u4929,m328,PAUL,"The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it."
170445,L173905,u4929,m328,PAUL,Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
170446,L173898,u4929,m328,PAUL,Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
170447,L173897,u4925,m328,JESSICA,A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
170448,L173893,u4929,m328,PAUL,The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...
170449,L173892,u4925,m328,JESSICA,Where are we do you think?
170450,L173891,u4929,m328,PAUL,I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
170451,L173869,u4925,m328,JESSICA,Excellent!
170452,L173868,u4929,m328,PAUL,Remove her gag!
170453,L173862,u4925,m328,JESSICA,Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
170454,L173861,u4929,m328,PAUL,Don't touch my mother...
170455,L173637,u4925,m328,JESSICA,"Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you."
170456,L173636,u4929,m328,PAUL,What does she fear?  What about my Father?
170457,L173635,u4925,m328,JESSICA,Your Reverence.

170460,L173814,u4929,m328,PAUL,Liet?
170461,L173809,u4926,m328,KYNES,Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
170462,L173808,u4929,m328,PAUL,Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
170463,L173780,u4926,m328,KYNES,To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
170464,L173779,u4929,m328,PAUL,Why do they come?
170465,L173778,u4926,m328,KYNES,Always.
170466,L173777,u4929,m328,PAUL,Always?
170467,L173776,u4926,m328,KYNES,Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
170468,L173775,u4929,m328,PAUL,Will we see a worm?
170469,L173770,u4926,m328,KYNES,That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
170470,L173769,u4929,m328,PAUL,No one. It... seemed the proper way.
170471,L173768,u4926,m328,KYNES,Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
170472,L173767,u4929,m328,PAUL,No.
170473,L173766,u4926,m328,KYNES,You've worn a stillsuit before?
170474,L173752,u4929,m328,PAUL,He's hiding something.
170475,L173751,u4926,m328,KYNES,I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
170476,L173750,u4929,m328,PAUL,Are you a Fremen?

170479,L174038,u4932,m328,STILGAR,Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
170480,L174037,u4929,m328,PAUL,We surprised a band of smugglers.
170481,L174020,u4932,m328,STILGAR,Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
170482,L174019,u4929,m328,PAUL,My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
170483,L173977,u4929,m328,PAUL,The most lethal poison in the Universe.
170484,L173976,u4932,m328,STILGAR,The Water of Life.
170485,L173956,u4932,m328,STILGAR,"Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!..."
170486,L173955,u4929,m328,PAUL,Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
170487,L173950,u4932,m328,STILGAR,"You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you."
170488,L173949,u4929,m328,PAUL,Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
170489,L173948,u4932,m328,STILGAR,We call that one Muad'dib.
170490,L173947,u4929,m328,PAUL,What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
170491,L173946,u4932,m328,STILGAR,"You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly."

170493,L174121,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,You mustn't speak of...
170494,L174118,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,"Stop him, Jessica!"
170495,L174117,u4929,m328,PAUL,Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
170496,L173980,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,They tried and died.
170497,L173979,u4929,m328,PAUL,Did they try and fail?
170498,L173978,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,... Many men have tried.
170499,L173675,u4929,m328,PAUL,MOTHER! Tell me!
170500,L173674,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,What can be done has been done.
170501,L173673,u4929,m328,PAUL,Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
170502,L173671,u4929,m328,PAUL,"I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!"
170503,L173670,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
170504,L173669,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,They tried and died....  Jessica!
170505,L173668,u4929,m328,PAUL,Did they try and fail?
170506,L173667,u4929,m328,PAUL,I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
170507,L173666,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
170508,L173665,u4929,m328,PAUL,Where?
170509,L173664,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
170510,L173663,u4929,m328,PAUL,What is it?
170511,L173662,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
170512,L173661,u4929,m328,PAUL,Not all of them... I know which ones will.
170513,L173660,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
170514,L173657,u4929,m328,PAUL,I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
170515,L173656,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
170516,L173655,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,"NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!"
170517,L173654,u4929,m328,PAUL,THE PAIN!
170518,L173652,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,You feel the flesh crisping?
170519,L173651,u4929,m328,PAUL,I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
170520,L173650,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,SILENCE... SILENCE.
170521,L173649,u4929,m328,PAUL,It burns.
170522,L173648,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,"Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat."
170523,L173647,u4929,m328,PAUL,Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
170524,L173646,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
170525,L173645,u4929,m328,PAUL,The Voice again.
170526,L173643,u4931,m328,REVEREND MOTHER,Pain.
170527,L173642,u4929,m328,PAUL,What's in the box?
170528,L173603,u4933,m328,THUFIR,"We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him."
170529,L173602,u4929,m328,PAUL,I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
170530,L173601,u4933,m328,THUFIR,Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
170531,L173600,u4929,m328,PAUL,"The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!"
170532,L173599,u4933,m328,THUFIR,"Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily."
170533,L173576,u4929,m328,PAUL,My father sent you to test me. Music then?
170534,L173575,u4933,m328,THUFIR,Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
170535,L173574,u4929,m328,PAUL,I'd know the difference.
170536,L173573,u4933,m328,THUFIR,Those sounds could be imitated.
170537,L173572,u4929,m328,PAUL,"I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall."
170538,L175308,u4934,m329,BELA,"Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count..."

170541,L175305,u4944,m329,HOST,"Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!"
170542,L175304,u4934,m329,BELA,It is my home.
170543,L175303,u4944,m329,HOST,"Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
170544,L175302,u4944,m329,HOST,"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure."

170548,L175619,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
170549,L175618,u4934,m329,BELA,No.
170550,L175617,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!

170552,L175615,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
170553,L175323,u4934,m329,BELA,No.  I never drink -- wine.
170554,L175322,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,"Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?"
170555,L175315,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,"Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!"
170556,L175314,u4934,m329,BELA,It's a pleasure...

170565,L175859,u4934,m329,BELA,Last night was quite a romp.

170572,L175792,u4934,m329,BELA,Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
170573,L175791,u4941,m329,ED,Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
170574,L175790,u4934,m329,BELA,Oh.  So what is the scene about?
170575,L175789,u4941,m329,ED,"No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later."
170576,L175788,u4934,m329,BELA,"So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?"

170582,L175762,u4934,m329,BELA,"Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!"
170583,L175761,u4941,m329,ED,"Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you."

170595,L175725,u4934,m329,BELA,"Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent..."
170596,L175724,u4941,m329,ED,"Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?"
170597,L175723,u4934,m329,BELA,I was thinking about killing myself.
170598,L175722,u4941,m329,ED,What are you doing?
170599,L175721,u4941,m329,ED,Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
170600,L175720,u4934,m329,BELA,Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
170601,L175719,u4941,m329,ED,"Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?"
170602,L175718,u4934,m329,BELA,Why are you here??
170603,L175609,u4941,m329,ED,I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
170604,L175608,u4934,m329,BELA,"Eddie, this is quite a scene."
170605,L175607,u4941,m329,ED,I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
170606,L175606,u4934,m329,BELA,"Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for..."
170607,L175605,u4941,m329,ED,No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
170608,L175604,u4934,m329,BELA,"That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty."
170609,L175603,u4941,m329,ED,Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
170610,L175597,u4941,m329,ED,Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
170611,L175596,u4934,m329,BELA,Don't let me slow you down.

170613,L175594,u4934,m329,BELA,"After I did ""Dracula,"" the studio offered me ""Frankenstein""!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me."

170615,L175592,u4934,m329,BELA,"Do you know I turned down ""Frankenstein""?"
170616,L175591,u4941,m329,ED,"Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you."
170617,L175590,u4934,m329,BELA,Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
170618,L175589,u4934,m329,BELA,"Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D."
170619,L175588,u4941,m329,ED,"Once you're in it, it warms up."

170624,L175583,u4941,m329,ED,You'll be fighting with the octopus.
170625,L175582,u4934,m329,BELA,Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
170626,L175576,u4941,m329,ED,"Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while."
170627,L175575,u4934,m329,BELA,"Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot..."
170628,L175503,u4934,m329,BELA,"Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one."
170629,L175502,u4941,m329,ED,But maybe not.
170630,L175501,u4934,m329,BELA,I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
170631,L175500,u4941,m329,ED,So why didn't you do it?
170632,L175499,u4934,m329,BELA,"It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king."

170634,L175497,u4934,m329,BELA,"In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture."
170635,L175496,u4941,m329,ED,"Yeah, I did."
170636,L175495,u4934,m329,BELA,"Eddie, you screwed up."
170637,L175494,u4941,m329,ED,"But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie."
170638,L175493,u4934,m329,BELA,Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
170639,L175492,u4941,m329,ED,Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
170640,L175488,u4934,m329,BELA,This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.

170659,L175294,u4934,m329,BELA,Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!

170689,L175180,u4941,m329,ED,But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
170690,L175179,u4934,m329,BELA,That's good.  I could use the money.
170691,L175178,u4941,m329,ED,"Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once ""Glen Or Glenda"" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!"
170692,L175177,u4934,m329,BELA,"Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl..."

170697,L175172,u4941,m329,ED,How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
170698,L175127,u4934,m329,BELA,BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
170699,L175126,u4941,m329,ED,"Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?"
170700,L175125,u4934,m329,BELA,"Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --"
170701,L175124,u4941,m329,ED,"You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting."
170702,L175115,u4941,m329,ED,"Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course."
170703,L175114,u4934,m329,BELA,"Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?"
170704,L175113,u4941,m329,ED,"Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --"
170705,L175112,u4934,m329,BELA,I am always on time.
170706,L175111,u4941,m329,ED,Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
170707,L175058,u4941,m329,ED,"Yeah.  You pull the strings --  ""Pull the strings""... hey, that's pretty good!"
170708,L175057,u4934,m329,BELA,"Ah, so I pull the strings!"
170709,L175056,u4941,m329,ED,Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
170710,L175055,u4934,m329,BELA,I don't understand.
170711,L175054,u4941,m329,ED,"Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything."
170712,L175053,u4934,m329,BELA,"Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production."
170713,L175052,u4941,m329,ED,"Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside."
170714,L175051,u4934,m329,BELA,"Eddie, what kind of movie is this?"
170715,L175050,u4941,m329,ED,"Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!"

170717,L175022,u4934,m329,BELA,Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
170718,L175021,u4941,m329,ED,Are you sure this is okay?
170719,L175013,u4934,m329,BELA,"No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright."
170720,L175012,u4941,m329,ED,Do you want me to get it for you?
170721,L175011,u4934,m329,BELA,I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
170722,L175010,u4934,m329,BELA,"You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes."

170724,L175008,u4934,m329,BELA,Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
170725,L175007,u4934,m329,BELA,I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
170726,L175006,u4941,m329,ED,Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
170727,L174982,u4934,m329,BELA,Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
170728,L174981,u4941,m329,ED,Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
170729,L174980,u4934,m329,BELA,Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
170730,L174978,u4934,m329,BELA,"Take my word for it.  You want to ""score"" with a young lady, you take her to see ""Dracula."""
170731,L174977,u4941,m329,ED,I never thought of that.
170732,L174976,u4934,m329,BELA,"The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror."

170734,L174974,u4934,m329,BELA,They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
170735,L174973,u4941,m329,ED,"The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons..."
170736,L174972,u4934,m329,BELA,"They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!"

170738,L174970,u4941,m329,ED,But you're a big star!
170739,L174969,u4934,m329,BELA,"Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela."
170740,L174968,u4941,m329,ED,"Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up."
170741,L174967,u4934,m329,BELA,I have no next picture.
170742,L174966,u4941,m329,ED,"Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?"
170743,L174965,u4934,m329,BELA,I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
170744,L174964,u4941,m329,ED,Don't you bave a car?
170745,L174963,u4934,m329,BELA,"Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!"
170746,L174962,u4934,m329,BELA,"I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge."

170748,L174960,u4934,m329,BELA,Thank you.
170749,L174959,u4941,m329,ED,I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
170750,L174958,u4934,m329,BELA,"Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!"
170751,L174957,u4941,m329,ED,"You know, I saw you perform ""Dracula.""  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938."
170752,L174956,u4934,m329,BELA,"Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andtruck tour of ""Dracula."" Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable."
170753,L174955,u4941,m329,ED,Really?
170754,L174954,u4934,m329,BELA,Because I'm planning on dying soon.
170755,L174953,u4941,m329,ED,Why were you buying a coffin?

170777,L175413,u4936,m329,CAMERAMAN BILL,"Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway."
170778,L175404,u4936,m329,CAMERAMAN BILL,I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind.  But I like the dark gray one.
170779,L175403,u4941,m329,ED,What do you mean?

170789,L175574,u4941,m329,ED,NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!

170792,L175338,u4941,m329,ED,"You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie."

170794,L175336,u4941,m329,ED,What do you think you're doin'?!

170807,L175543,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
170808,L175330,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,"Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything."
170809,L175329,u4941,m329,ED,It's that easy?
170810,L175328,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
170811,L175327,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,I made it up.  It's horseshit!
170812,L175326,u4941,m329,ED,I don't understand.
170813,L175325,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,I guessed.
170814,L175324,u4941,m329,ED,"Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?"
170815,L175321,u4938,m329,CRISWELL,I'm Criswell.  I know all.

170822,L175773,u4939,m329,DOCTOR,No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
170823,L175772,u4941,m329,ED,Isn't he?
170824,L175771,u4939,m329,DOCTOR,We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
170825,L175753,u4939,m329,DOCTOR,We'll do our best.
170826,L175752,u4941,m329,ED,Will he be okay?
170827,L175751,u4939,m329,DOCTOR,"Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone."
170828,L175750,u4941,m329,ED,Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
170829,L175634,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I."
170830,L175633,u4941,m329,ED,But you used to say --
170831,L175632,u4940,m329,DOLORES,I'm tired of living on the fringe.
170832,L175631,u4941,m329,ED,Did you really mean those things you said..?
170833,L175630,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life."
170834,L175629,u4941,m329,ED,"Dolores, wait!"
170835,L175541,u4941,m329,ED,"Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around."
170836,L175540,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?"
170837,L175539,u4941,m329,ED,"Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet."
170838,L175538,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?"
170839,L175530,u4941,m329,ED,"Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing."
170840,L175529,u4940,m329,DOLORES,Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
170841,L175528,u4941,m329,ED,None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
170842,L175527,u4940,m329,DOLORES,Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
170843,L175526,u4941,m329,ED,That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
170844,L175524,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?"
170845,L175523,u4941,m329,ED,That's right...
170846,L175522,u4940,m329,DOLORES,Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
170847,L175521,u4941,m329,ED,"Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message."
170848,L175482,u4941,m329,ED,Does she have room for me?
170849,L175481,u4940,m329,DOLORES,I'm going to my mother's.

170851,L175479,u4940,m329,DOLORES,You're a fuckin' mess.
170852,L175478,u4941,m329,ED,<u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
170853,L175477,u4940,m329,DOLORES,That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
170854,L175476,u4941,m329,ED,"Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich."
170855,L175475,u4940,m329,DOLORES,That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
170856,L175474,u4941,m329,ED,"Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money."
170857,L175473,u4940,m329,DOLORES,I told you this was gonna happen.
170858,L175472,u4941,m329,ED,Goddamn landlord.
170859,L175388,u4941,m329,ED,The secretary.  Or the file clerk.

170861,L175386,u4941,m329,ED,But there's plenty of other parts.

170863,L175384,u4941,m329,ED,I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
170864,L175383,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!"
170865,L175382,u4941,m329,ED,It was the only way I could get the movie made!
170866,L175362,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"All I know is, ever since ""Glen Or Glenda,"" all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!"
170867,L175361,u4941,m329,ED,"Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made ""Glen Or Glenda.""  Directing <u>is</u> my day job."
170868,L175360,u4940,m329,DOLORES,Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
170869,L175359,u4941,m329,ED,"That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!"
170870,L175358,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"Ed, the landlord doesn't care."
170871,L175357,u4941,m329,ED,"Tell him ""Bride"" is in pre- production."
170872,L175356,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money."
170873,L175284,u4940,m329,DOLORES,Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
170874,L175283,u4941,m329,ED,All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
170875,L175282,u4940,m329,DOLORES,That's ridiculous.
170876,L175281,u4941,m329,ED,Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.

170882,L175168,u4941,m329,ED,"But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!"
170883,L175167,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job."
170884,L175166,u4941,m329,ED,Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
170885,L175165,u4940,m329,DOLORES,I don't know.  It's so much money...
170886,L175164,u4941,m329,ED,"From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did."
170887,L175155,u4941,m329,ED,Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
170888,L175154,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"Ed, who is Daniel Davis?"

170893,L175075,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"Oh, just like in the script!"
170894,L175074,u4941,m329,ED,It takes me comfortable.
170895,L175073,u4940,m329,DOLORES,"<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!"
170896,L175072,u4941,m329,ED,It's a damn good role.

170898,L175070,u4941,m329,ED,Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.

170903,L175065,u4941,m329,ED,"Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit."

170905,L175061,u4941,m329,ED,"Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait..."

170930,L174880,u4941,m329,ED,The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
170931,L174879,u4940,m329,DOLORES,What?
170932,L174878,u4941,m329,ED,"Dolores, give me your shoes."
170933,L175446,u4946,m329,LORETTA,You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
170934,L175445,u4941,m329,ED,The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
170935,L175444,u4946,m329,LORETTA,What other sixty-thousand?
170936,L175443,u4941,m329,ED,Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
170937,L175442,u4946,m329,LORETTA,What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
170938,L175441,u4941,m329,ED,I kinda need it now.
170939,L175440,u4941,m329,ED,Yeah.  Exactly!
170940,L175439,u4946,m329,LORETTA,"Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?"
170941,L175438,u4941,m329,ED,"Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money."
170942,L175401,u4941,m329,ED,"I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?"
170943,L175400,u4946,m329,LORETTA,"Eddie, which dress do you like better?"
170944,L175378,u4946,m329,LORETTA,"Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her."
170945,L175377,u4941,m329,ED,"Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!"
170946,L175376,u4946,m329,LORETTA,"Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?"
170947,L175375,u4941,m329,ED,Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
170948,L175374,u4946,m329,LORETTA,That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
170949,L175373,u4941,m329,ED,"For this one, we need $60,000."
170950,L175372,u4946,m329,LORETTA,Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
170951,L175371,u4941,m329,ED,So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
170952,L175368,u4946,m329,LORETTA,Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
170953,L175367,u4941,m329,ED,I understand you just moved here?
170954,L175366,u4946,m329,LORETTA,Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
170955,L175005,u4941,m329,ED,"Well, uh, if I could I would..."
170956,L175004,u4953,m329,RUDE BOSS,"He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him."
170957,L175003,u4941,m329,ED,That's not true --
170958,L175002,u4953,m329,RUDE BOSS,Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
170959,L175001,u4941,m329,ED,"No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  ""Dracula""!  ""The Raven""! ""The Black Cat""!"
170960,L175000,u4953,m329,RUDE BOSS,He's a <u>bum</u>.
170961,L174905,u4941,m329,ED,"Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz."
170962,L174904,u4953,m329,RUDE BOSS,"Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building."
170963,L175214,u4947,m329,MR. FELDMAN,"Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together."
170964,L175213,u4941,m329,ED,"Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is ""Bride Of The Atom."""
170965,L175212,u4947,m329,MR. FELDMAN,Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?
170966,L175211,u4941,m329,ED,But Bela Lugosi's in it!
170967,L175210,u4947,m329,MR. FELDMAN,"Oh, ""Dr. Acula.""  I get it.  I don't like it."
170968,L175209,u4941,m329,ED,<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
170969,L175208,u4947,m329,MR. FELDMAN,Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
170970,L175207,u4941,m329,ED,"Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: ""The Vampire's Tomb,"" ""The Ghoul Goes West""... and ""Doctor Acula""!"
170971,L175206,u4947,m329,MR. FELDMAN,I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
170972,L175205,u4941,m329,ED,"Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents."
170973,L175204,u4947,m329,MR. FELDMAN,"Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them."
170974,L175203,u4941,m329,ED,"I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week."
170975,L175202,u4947,m329,MR. FELDMAN,Really?!  Well good for you.
170976,L175201,u4941,m329,ED,"Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie."
170977,L175200,u4947,m329,MR. FELDMAN,So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
170978,L175199,u4947,m329,MR. FELDMAN,"Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?"
170979,L175198,u4941,m329,ED,It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
170980,L175197,u4947,m329,MR. FELDMAN,"Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you."
170981,L176036,u4941,m329,ED,We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!
170982,L176035,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,Yes?
170983,L176034,u4941,m329,ED,Mr. Reynolds!
170984,L175999,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,"Oh, you wanna talk about the ""big picture""?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???"
170985,L175998,u4941,m329,ED,People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
170986,L175997,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
170987,L175996,u4941,m329,ED,I like to think so.
170988,L175995,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,"""Perfect""?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!"
170989,L175994,u4941,m329,ED,And PERFECT.  CUT!
170990,L175986,u4941,m329,ED,"Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue."
170991,L175985,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
170992,L175910,u4941,m329,ED,"It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as ""Bela Lugosi's Final Film"""
170993,L175909,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,"Just, it doesn't look like very much."
170994,L175908,u4941,m329,ED,"Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!"
170995,L175907,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,<u>Lugosi</u>??!  Didn't be pass on?
170996,L175906,u4941,m329,ED,"Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!"
170997,L175905,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,"Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?"
170998,L175904,u4941,m329,ED,It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
170999,L175903,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
171000,L175902,u4941,m329,ED,"From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits."
171001,L175901,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
171002,L175900,u4941,m329,ED,"""Graverobbers From Outer Space""! It's <u>money in the bank</u>."
171003,L175899,u4941,m329,ED,Absolutely!  You see this script..?
171004,L175898,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,Would that work?
171005,L175897,u4941,m329,ED,"Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies."
171006,L175896,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...
171007,L175895,u4941,m329,ED,Raising money is tough.
171008,L175894,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,"<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money."
171009,L175893,u4941,m329,ED,You could say that --
171010,L175892,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,"Hmm, so you're in the picture business?"
171011,L175891,u4941,m329,ED,"I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one."
171012,L175890,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,"Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check."
171013,L175889,u4941,m329,ED,Yeah...?
171014,L175888,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,"Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?"
171015,L175887,u4941,m329,ED,Hruphh...?
171016,L175886,u4952,m329,REYNOLDS,Mr. Wood?!
171017,L175854,u4941,m329,ED,We're escaping!
171018,L175853,u4954,m329,TOR,What is happening?
171019,L175828,u4941,m329,ED,Don't worry.  We're almost there.
171020,L175827,u4954,m329,TOR,My eyes are killink me.
171021,L175656,u4954,m329,TOR,Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
171022,L175655,u4941,m329,ED,But I thought me and Dolores had something.
171023,L175654,u4954,m329,TOR,"My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her."
171024,L175653,u4954,m329,TOR,Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
171025,L175652,u4941,m329,ED,"Tor, I should be getting home."
171026,L175645,u4954,m329,TOR,Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
171027,L175644,u4941,m329,ED,"I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family."
171028,L175643,u4954,m329,TOR,The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
171029,L175642,u4941,m329,ED,"Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately."
171030,L175641,u4954,m329,TOR,Hey!  You're not eatink.
171031,L175425,u4954,m329,TOR,Okey-dokey.
171032,L175424,u4941,m329,ED,"Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you."
171033,L175399,u4954,m329,TOR,But Greta say --
171034,L175398,u4941,m329,ED,"Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face."
171035,L175397,u4954,m329,TOR,"Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk."
171036,L175396,u4941,m329,ED,"But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed."
171037,L175395,u4954,m329,TOR,No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
171038,L175394,u4941,m329,ED,Really?  Was the third act too intense?
171039,L175393,u4954,m329,TOR,"Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like."
171040,L175262,u4941,m329,ED,"Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM."
171041,L175261,u4954,m329,TOR,I like.  When do movie shoot?
171042,L175260,u4941,m329,ED,"So anyway, I've got this new script, ""Bride Of The Atom,"" and there's a part you're ideal for: ""Lobo.""  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl."
171043,L175254,u4941,m329,ED,"Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium."
171044,L175253,u4954,m329,TOR,But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
171045,L175252,u4941,m329,ED,"Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures."
171046,L175251,u4954,m329,TOR,"No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that."

171056,L176032,u4949,m329,ORSON WELLES,"It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  ""Kane.""  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?"
171057,L176031,u4941,m329,ED,"Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?"
171058,L176030,u4949,m329,ORSON WELLES,"Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!"
171059,L176029,u4941,m329,ED,And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
171060,L176028,u4949,m329,ORSON WELLES,"Ugh, I hate when that happens."
171061,L176027,u4941,m329,ED,Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
171062,L176026,u4949,m329,ORSON WELLES,"It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director..."
171063,L176025,u4941,m329,ED,I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
171064,L176024,u4949,m329,ORSON WELLES,"Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on ""Don Quixote."" So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta."

171066,L176022,u4949,m329,ORSON WELLES,My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
171067,L176021,u4941,m329,ED,"Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you."
171068,L176020,u4949,m329,ORSON WELLES,Yes?

171070,L175228,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"""Your movie""?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!"
171071,L175227,u4941,m329,ED,You can't talk that way about my movie.
171072,L175226,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: ""Transvestite"" ""He Or She?"" ""I Led Two Lives""... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit."
171073,L175225,u4941,m329,ED,Maybe it needs special handling.
171074,L175224,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it."
171075,L175223,u4941,m329,ED,Why not??
171076,L175222,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"""Where's the ads""?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!"
171077,L175158,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,I did.  I established some tits and ass.
171078,L175157,u4941,m329,ED,"Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!"
171079,L175152,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!"
171080,L175151,u4941,m329,ED,"But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane""!"
171081,L175150,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer."
171082,L175149,u4941,m329,ED,"Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props."
171083,L175148,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"Good.  And one more thing.  I think your ""Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood"" credit is a bad idea."
171084,L175147,u4941,m329,ED,"Um, I guess --"
171085,L175146,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots..."
171086,L175145,u4941,m329,ED,"Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice."
171087,L175144,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it."
171088,L175143,u4941,m329,ED,Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
171089,L175142,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
171090,L175108,u4941,m329,ED,I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
171091,L175107,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
171092,L175106,u4941,m329,ED,Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
171093,L175105,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
171094,L175083,u4941,m329,ED,"So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA."
171095,L175082,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"And what's with this new title?!  My poster says ""I CHANGED MY SEX""!"
171096,L175081,u4941,m329,ED,I don't think he's a schmuck.
171097,L175080,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
171098,L175079,u4941,m329,ED,There's still a sex-change --
171099,L175078,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
171100,L175045,u4941,m329,ED,Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
171101,L175044,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
171102,L175043,u4941,m329,ED,"Uh, yeah.  Our picture."
171103,L175042,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,OUR picture?
171104,L175041,u4941,m329,ED,"No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture."
171105,L175040,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Isn't he dead?
171106,L175039,u4941,m329,ED,Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
171107,L175038,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Lugosi?
171108,L175037,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Who?
171109,L175036,u4941,m329,ED,What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
171110,L175035,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about."
171111,L175034,u4941,m329,ED,No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
171112,L175033,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Yeah.  Crap with a star.
171113,L175032,u4941,m329,ED,"Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!"
171114,L175031,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap."
171115,L175030,u4941,m329,ED,No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
171116,L175029,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Tits.
171117,L175028,u4941,m329,ED,"Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??"
171118,L174940,u4941,m329,ED,"Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out."
171119,L174939,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
171120,L174938,u4941,m329,ED,"Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret."
171121,L174937,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,You gotta be kiddin' me.
171122,L174936,u4941,m329,ED,"Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform."
171123,L174935,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,So you're not a fruit?
171124,L174934,u4941,m329,ED,"No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them."
171125,L174933,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Are you a fruit?
171126,L174932,u4941,m329,ED,"Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing."
171127,L174931,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of ""special qualifications."""
171128,L174930,u4941,m329,ED,"Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism."
171129,L174929,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
171130,L174928,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
171131,L174927,u4941,m329,ED,Is there a script?
171132,L174926,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already presold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it."
171133,L174925,u4941,m329,ED,So you're not gonna make the movie?
171134,L174924,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,"Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn ""Variety"" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky."
171135,L174923,u4941,m329,ED,"Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture."
171136,L174922,u4943,m329,GEORGIE,Can I help you?
171137,L176066,u4941,m329,ED,"So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise."
171138,L176065,u4945,m329,KATHY,But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
171139,L176064,u4941,m329,ED,<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!

171144,L176056,u4945,m329,KATHY,"Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere."
171145,L176055,u4941,m329,ED,I can't get it to go up.

171149,L175936,u4941,m329,ED,"Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends."
171150,L175935,u4945,m329,KATHY,You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
171151,L175930,u4941,m329,ED,Yeah...  I should give her a call.
171152,L175929,u4945,m329,KATHY,The poor girl's out of a job.
171153,L175928,u4941,m329,ED,Those assholes.
171154,L175926,u4941,m329,ED,Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.
171155,L175925,u4945,m329,KATHY,The sun.
171156,L175924,u4941,m329,ED,"No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??"

171158,L175922,u4941,m329,ED,No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
171159,L175921,u4945,m329,KATHY,"Uh, atomic energy?"
171160,L175920,u4941,m329,ED,"The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?"
171161,L175919,u4945,m329,KATHY,Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
171162,L175918,u4941,m329,ED,"You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!"
171163,L175885,u4941,m329,ED,"I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down..."

171165,L175883,u4941,m329,ED,I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
171166,L175882,u4945,m329,KATHY,"Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!"
171167,L175881,u4941,m329,ED,"I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out..."
171168,L175877,u4941,m329,ED,Bela died.
171169,L175876,u4945,m329,KATHY,What was that?
171170,L175873,u4941,m329,ED,"Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?"

171177,L175819,u4945,m329,KATHY,Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
171178,L175818,u4941,m329,ED,"I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road."
171179,L175817,u4945,m329,KATHY,Huh?

171217,L175938,u4941,m329,ED,You don't wanna be noticed?
171218,L175937,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,"Look... would it be possible to make the ""Ghoul's Wife"" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?"
171219,L175934,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,"The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this..."
171220,L175933,u4941,m329,ED,"I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the ""Ghoul's Wife."""
171221,L175932,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
171222,L175931,u4941,m329,ED,I'm really sorry...
171223,L175826,u4941,m329,ED,"It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!"
171224,L175825,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,"Didn't you just make one called ""Bride Of The Atom""?"
171225,L175824,u4941,m329,ED,"No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, ""Bride Of The Monster."""
171226,L175465,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,"Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!"
171227,L175464,u4941,m329,ED,"Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard..."

So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?"
171230,L175461,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --

171232,L175459,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?

171250,L175562,u4950,m329,PAUL MARCO,You're sure this is gonna work?
171251,L175553,u4941,m329,ED,"Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!"
171252,L175552,u4950,m329,PAUL MARCO,"Ed, you said you were getting permission."
171253,L175417,u4941,m329,ED,"Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?"
171254,L175416,u4950,m329,PAUL MARCO,"We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner."
171255,L175415,u4941,m329,ED,"Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?"
171256,L175365,u4950,m329,PAUL MARCO,"Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from ""old money,"" and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!"
171257,L175364,u4941,m329,ED,Yeah...?
171258,L175363,u4950,m329,PAUL MARCO,"Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news."
171259,L175163,u4950,m329,PAUL MARCO,Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
171260,L175162,u4941,m329,ED,Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
171261,L175104,u4941,m329,ED,Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
171262,L175103,u4950,m329,PAUL MARCO,I don't know.
171263,L175102,u4941,m329,ED,The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
171264,L174894,u4941,m329,ED,So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.
171265,L174893,u4950,m329,PAUL MARCO,Lines around the block.
171266,L174892,u4941,m329,ED,"Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last ""Francis the Mule"" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit."
171267,L176038,u4941,m329,ED,"And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!"
171268,L176037,u4951,m329,REVEREND LEMON,B-but it's our money --
171269,L176011,u4941,m329,ED,I'm directing.
171270,L176010,u4951,m329,REVEREND LEMON,Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
171271,L176006,u4941,m329,ED,NOOOOO!!!
171272,L176005,u4951,m329,REVEREND LEMON,I thought this was a group effort.
171273,L176004,u4941,m329,ED,Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
171274,L176003,u4951,m329,REVEREND LEMON,This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
171275,L175992,u4941,m329,ED,"No, he would've loved it!  Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula.  CUE VAMPIRA!"
171276,L175991,u4951,m329,REVEREND LEMON,Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
171277,L175990,u4941,m329,ED,Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
171278,L175977,u4951,m329,REVEREND LEMON,Mr. Wood!
171279,L175976,u4941,m329,ED,"What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!"
171280,L175960,u4941,m329,ED,I do.
171281,L175959,u4951,m329,REVEREND LEMON,...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
171282,L175716,u4948,m329,NORMA,No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
171283,L175715,u4941,m329,ED,"Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!"
171284,L175713,u4941,m329,ED,"Honey, I have a little secret to share with you."
171285,L175712,u4948,m329,NORMA,What the heck is THIS?!!
171286,L175710,u4941,m329,ED,"Don't worry, I'll teach you."
171287,L175709,u4948,m329,NORMA,"Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before."
171288,L175682,u4941,m329,ED,You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
171289,L175681,u4948,m329,NORMA,"My goodness, you're embarrassing me."
171290,L175680,u4941,m329,ED,"You know, you're a very attractive girl."
171291,L175679,u4948,m329,NORMA,Wow.
171292,L175678,u4941,m329,ED,Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
171293,L175677,u4948,m329,NORMA,"Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that."
171294,L175676,u4941,m329,ED,"No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer."
171295,L175675,u4948,m329,NORMA,"What are you, an angora wholesaler?"
171296,L175674,u4941,m329,ED,It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
171297,L175673,u4948,m329,NORMA,I suppose.  It's very expensive.
171298,L175672,u4941,m329,ED,Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
171299,L175671,u4948,m329,NORMA,Why... yes.
171300,L175669,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,"Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens."
171301,L175668,u4942,m329,ED'S VOICE,"No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?"
171302,L175667,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,Isn't that the same thing?
171303,L175666,u4942,m329,ED'S VOICE,"ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite."
171304,L175665,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
171305,L175664,u4942,m329,ED'S VOICE,"Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner."
171306,L175663,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,Oh.  Yeah.  You.
171307,L175662,u4942,m329,ED'S VOICE,"Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed ""Bride Of The Atom""!"
171308,L175661,u4955,m329,VAMPIRA,Who?
171309,L175660,u4942,m329,ED'S VOICE,"Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood."
171310,L177237,u4956,m330,AL,"Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me."
171311,L177236,u4960,m330,ED,"Oh, Al ... This is just..."
171312,L177235,u4956,m330,AL,"I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights."
171313,L177234,u4960,m330,ED,What?!
171314,L177233,u4956,m330,AL,I'm moving out.
171315,L177232,u4960,m330,ED,Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
171316,L177185,u4960,m330,ED,Went --
171317,L177184,u4956,m330,AL,It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
171318,L177183,u4960,m330,ED,Yes!
171319,L177182,u4956,m330,AL,You thought it was me?
171320,L177176,u4956,m330,AL,Where is she? Is she all right?
171321,L177175,u4960,m330,ED,Al!!
171322,L177174,u4956,m330,AL,Our neighbors gave me a ride.
171323,L177173,u4960,m330,ED,Al!
171324,L177172,u4956,m330,AL,How's your mother?
171325,L176889,u4956,m330,AL,"Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch."
171326,L176888,u4960,m330,ED,No.
171327,L176887,u4956,m330,AL,Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
171328,L176881,u4960,m330,ED,"I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you..."
171329,L176880,u4956,m330,AL,"Jeanette, you're hurting me."
171330,L176864,u4956,m330,AL,"No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley."
171331,L176863,u4960,m330,ED,"Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al."
171332,L176862,u4956,m330,AL,They celebrated the common person.
171333,L176861,u4960,m330,ED,"Yeah, so... ?"
171334,L176860,u4956,m330,AL,"Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor..."
171335,L176859,u4960,m330,ED,Who?
171336,L176858,u4956,m330,AL,Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
171337,L176580,u4956,m330,AL,Look at your face. I had a car that color.
171338,L176579,u4960,m330,ED,Come on...
171339,L176578,u4956,m330,AL,What do you love her or something?
171340,L176559,u4960,m330,ED,Yeah. Ma...
171341,L176558,u4956,m330,AL,"She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night."
171342,L176557,u4960,m330,ED,Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
171343,L176556,u4960,m330,ED,"No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you."
171344,L176555,u4956,m330,AL,Anything good?
171345,L176554,u4960,m330,ED,Yeah. I brought you some movies.
171346,L176259,u4960,m330,ED,"At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me."
171347,L176258,u4956,m330,AL,At what point?
171348,L176257,u4960,m330,ED,"No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away."
171349,L176256,u4956,m330,AL,No! Do they show you having sex?
171350,L176255,u4960,m330,ED,"I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --"
171351,L176236,u4960,m330,ED,I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
171352,L176235,u4956,m330,AL,Do they show it?
171353,L176234,u4960,m330,ED,What if I'm vomiting?
171354,L176233,u4956,m330,AL,What if--you're vomiting?
171355,L176232,u4960,m330,ED,"No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -"
171356,L177118,u4957,m330,BARRY,You know it.
171357,L177117,u4973,m330,TAD,"Ooh, the sister! She is hot."
171358,L177116,u4957,m330,BARRY,Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
171359,L176812,u4957,m330,BARRY,If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
171360,L176811,u4973,m330,TAD,What?
171361,L176810,u4957,m330,BARRY,You know what would be great?
171362,L176809,u4973,m330,TAD,She doesn't give a shit about him.
171363,L176808,u4957,m330,BARRY,You think she really likes him?
171364,L176604,u4957,m330,BARRY,"So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder."
171365,L176603,u4973,m330,TAD,So?
171366,L176602,u4957,m330,BARRY,"This is real, Bananahead!"
171367,L176601,u4973,m330,TAD,"You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing."
171368,L176600,u4957,m330,BARRY,"What do you mean ""they're gonna have him die?"""
171369,L176599,u4973,m330,TAD,I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
171370,L176387,u4973,m330,TAD,"Okay, I'm nuts."
171371,L176386,u4957,m330,BARRY,You're nuts.
171372,L176385,u4973,m330,TAD,Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
171373,L176384,u4957,m330,BARRY,What?
171374,L176383,u4973,m330,TAD,Did you see that?
171375,L177284,u4960,m330,ED,"Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do."
171376,L177283,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,I don't think so.
171377,L177132,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
171378,L177131,u4960,m330,ED,No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
171379,L177130,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Ed --
171380,L177129,u4960,m330,ED,"You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  ""Leave her be, see other people for a while."" You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show."
171381,L177128,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Ed --
171382,L177127,u4960,m330,ED,"Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!"
171383,L177126,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"Ed, everything goes off. ""Cheers"" went off. ""Mash"" went off --"
171384,L176989,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth."
171385,L176988,u4960,m330,ED,You said a woman likes to be pursued.
171386,L176987,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Leave her be.
171387,L176986,u4960,m330,ED,"Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --"
171388,L176985,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"Ed, do you want my advice?"
171389,L176984,u4960,m330,ED,What if Shari's the dream?
171390,L176983,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Great line.
171391,L176982,u4960,m330,ED,"You asked me if I had a dream. I said ""Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."""
171392,L176981,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Yeah.
171393,L176685,u4960,m330,ED,Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
171394,L176684,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
171395,L176683,u4960,m330,ED,Yeah?!
171396,L176682,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!"
171397,L176681,u4960,m330,ED,They tore her dress! ...
171398,L176652,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,A woman wants to be pursued.
171399,L176651,u4960,m330,ED,Sure.
171400,L176650,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
171401,L176649,u4960,m330,ED,Yeah?
171402,L176647,u4960,m330,ED,"And all the kids stared calling me ""Pumpkin Ass."" ""Hey Pumpkin Ass,"" -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm ""Pumpkin Ass"" again."
171403,L176646,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Uh-huh?
171404,L176645,u4960,m330,ED,I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
171405,L176644,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"How you doing, Ed?"
171406,L176643,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
171407,L176642,u4960,m330,ED,Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
171408,L176641,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"Yes, Ed."
171409,L176281,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,I do.
171410,L176280,u4960,m330,ED,Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
171411,L176279,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
171412,L176278,u4960,m330,ED,"No, uh..."
171413,L176277,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?"
171414,L176276,u4960,m330,ED,"Um, yeah -- thanks."
171415,L176275,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?"
171416,L176274,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,I want you to take this.
171417,L176273,u4960,m330,ED,Cool.
171418,L176272,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you."
171419,L176271,u4960,m330,ED,Excuse me.
171420,L176270,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"Ed, can I see you a second."
171421,L176183,u4960,m330,ED,"Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?"
171422,L176182,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,What did you study?
171423,L177336,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"I've got this great idea. We put together a video. ""The Network Executives Goofiest Moments."" And listen, i've really loved working here."
171424,L177335,u4971,m330,SCHARLACH,Where are you going?
171425,L177113,u4971,m330,SCHARLACH,"Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby."
171426,L177112,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!"
171427,L177061,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Good luck.
171428,L177060,u4971,m330,SCHARLACH,"With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!"
171429,L177059,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,"I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us."
171430,L177058,u4971,m330,SCHARLACH,What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
171431,L177057,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,Take him off the air.
171432,L176195,u4971,m330,SCHARLACH,I'm not sure about the entire concept.
171433,L176194,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
171434,L176193,u4971,m330,SCHARLACH,This guy.
171435,L176192,u4958,m330,CYNTHIA,He's who we want to go with.
171436,L177180,u4959,m330,DR. GELLER,No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
171437,L177179,u4960,m330,ED,Al!

171439,L177177,u4960,m330,ED,I thought -- I thought he was dead.
171440,L177170,u4959,m330,DR. GELLER,I ... don't know. I ...
171441,L177169,u4960,m330,ED,Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
171442,L177168,u4959,m330,DR. GELLER,"According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --"
171443,L177167,u4960,m330,ED,Really? They were..
171444,L177166,u4959,m330,DR. GELLER,"Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet."
171445,L177165,u4960,m330,ED,What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
171446,L177164,u4959,m330,DR. GELLER,
171447,L177163,u4960,m330,ED,"Mm...  Oh, man..."
171448,L177162,u4959,m330,DR. GELLER,Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
171449,L177161,u4960,m330,ED,Thank you. Can I see her?
171450,L177160,u4959,m330,DR. GELLER,I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
171451,L177159,u4960,m330,ED,Yes?
171452,L177158,u4959,m330,DR. GELLER,Mr. Pekurny.
171453,L177144,u4965,m330,JOHN,Oh.
171454,L177143,u4960,m330,ED,So he killed himself.
171455,L177142,u4965,m330,JOHN,Right.
171456,L177141,u4960,m330,ED,"And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again."
171457,L177140,u4965,m330,JOHN,"Right, right..."
171458,L177139,u4960,m330,ED,"Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him"
171459,L177138,u4965,m330,JOHN,"Oh right, right! She fell down, like a..."
171460,L177137,u4960,m330,ED,"No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!"
171461,L177136,u4965,m330,JOHN,When? Today?
171462,L177135,u4960,m330,ED,You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
171463,L176790,u4960,m330,ED,What?
171464,L176789,u4965,m330,JOHN,"No! Don't --  Oh, wow."
171465,L176788,u4960,m330,ED,"Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you."
171466,L176787,u4965,m330,JOHN,"Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?"
171467,L176786,u4960,m330,ED,"Aah, I wanted Shari to come."
171468,L176785,u4965,m330,JOHN,Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
171469,L176784,u4960,m330,ED,"Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?"
171470,L176128,u4960,m330,ED,"Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?"
171471,L176127,u4965,m330,JOHN,"Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?"
171472,L176107,u4965,m330,JOHN,Your brother's here.
171473,L176106,u4960,m330,ED,So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
171474,L176105,u4965,m330,JOHN,"I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says ""If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life."" And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag."
171475,L176104,u4960,m330,ED,I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
171476,L176103,u4965,m330,JOHN,We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
171477,L176102,u4960,m330,ED,Tell me.
171478,L176101,u4965,m330,JOHN,You know who we are?
171479,L176100,u4965,m330,JOHN,We're falling behind.
171480,L176099,u4960,m330,ED,You said that.

171488,L177245,u4960,m330,ED,You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
171489,L177244,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Ed! How did you know I was here?
171490,L177211,u4960,m330,ED,"Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!"
171491,L177210,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
171492,L177208,u4960,m330,ED,"Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?"
171493,L177207,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
171494,L177206,u4960,m330,ED,But Al is your husband now!
171495,L177205,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
171496,L177204,u4960,m330,ED,Why? How...
171497,L177203,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Oh my god! On TV!
171498,L177202,u4960,m330,ED,Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
171499,L177201,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,To you? In front of him?  With the...
171500,L177200,u4960,m330,ED,The doctor said you were having sex.
171501,L177199,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,What?
171502,L177198,u4960,m330,ED,So you had sex with him?
171503,L177197,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
171504,L177196,u4960,m330,ED,Who?
171505,L177195,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,It was horrible. He called me up.
171506,L177194,u4960,m330,ED,What happened?
171507,L177153,u4960,m330,ED,I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
171508,L177152,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,St. Joseph's.
171509,L177151,u4960,m330,ED,Oh God. What hospital?
171510,L177150,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,"He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart."
171511,L177149,u4960,m330,ED,What's the matter?!
171512,L177148,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,I'm at the hospital.
171513,L177147,u4960,m330,ED,Mom?
171514,L177146,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Eddie...
171515,L176886,u4960,m330,ED,What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
171516,L176885,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,"Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie."
171517,L176884,u4960,m330,ED,Who?
171518,L176883,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,And what did he come back now for?
171519,L176882,u4960,m330,ED,"If I don't call you ""Dad"" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --"
171520,L176879,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,"He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him ""Dad"" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone."
171521,L176878,u4960,m330,ED,Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
171522,L176874,u4960,m330,ED,The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
171523,L176873,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,What's the difference?
171524,L176872,u4960,m330,ED,So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
171525,L176871,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,She had white shoes.
171526,L176870,u4960,m330,ED,Could've been a nurse?
171527,L176869,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,She could've been a nurse.
171528,L176868,u4960,m330,ED,But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
171529,L176867,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,"He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose."
171530,L176866,u4960,m330,ED,Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
171531,L176865,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
171532,L176857,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,"I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!"
171533,L176856,u4960,m330,ED,He says --
171534,L176855,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,He had girlfriends!
171535,L176853,u4960,m330,ED,Holy sh--
171536,L176852,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Both.
171537,L176851,u4960,m330,ED,Yes to me or yes to the coil?
171538,L176850,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Yes.
171539,L176842,u4960,m330,ED,So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
171540,L176841,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
171541,L176839,u4960,m330,ED,I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
171542,L176838,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,I can't believe you're taking his side.
171543,L176590,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Oh my God!!
171544,L176589,u4960,m330,ED,"I mean, that worked out."
171545,L176588,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Oh my God!
171546,L176587,u4960,m330,ED,You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
171547,L176586,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Mm.
171548,L176585,u4960,m330,ED,"Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time."
171549,L176584,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,"I don't know. She's living with that ""entertainer""..."
171550,L176583,u4960,m330,ED,How's Marcia? She all right?
171551,L176582,u4960,m330,ED,"No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?"
171552,L176581,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
171553,L176577,u4960,m330,ED,No! And that girl has a name.
171554,L176576,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
171555,L176575,u4960,m330,ED,I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
171556,L176574,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,He made a mistake.
171557,L176573,u4960,m330,ED,"Hey, he cheated on her."
171558,L176572,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,"Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend."
171559,L176571,u4960,m330,ED,"Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --"
171560,L176569,u4960,m330,ED,"Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you."
171561,L176568,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,No. It's a mess.
171562,L176567,u4960,m330,ED,Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
171563,L176566,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,No.
171564,L176565,u4960,m330,ED,"Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --"
171565,L176564,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Send him away.
171566,L176563,u4960,m330,ED,Yeah. The camera guy is here.
171567,L176562,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Are the TV people with you?
171568,L176561,u4960,m330,ED,Yeah?
171569,L176560,u4963,m330,JEANETTE,Eddie? ...
171570,L176977,u4970,m330,RITA,She wouldn't tell me.
171571,L176976,u4960,m330,ED,I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
171572,L176975,u4970,m330,RITA,"She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself."
171573,L176974,u4960,m330,ED,What are you talking about?
171574,L176973,u4970,m330,RITA,She won't.
171575,L176972,u4960,m330,ED,"Well, when will she be back?"
171576,L176971,u4970,m330,RITA,She left.
171577,L176970,u4960,m330,ED,"What is she, at work?"
171578,L176969,u4970,m330,RITA,No.
171579,L176968,u4960,m330,ED,Hi. Is Shari here?
171580,L176493,u4960,m330,ED,"Shari, Ray feels --"
171581,L176492,u4970,m330,RITA,"Hi, Mom."
171582,L176484,u4960,m330,ED,"No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?"
171583,L176483,u4970,m330,RITA,She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
171584,L176482,u4960,m330,ED,"Right, yeah --"
171585,L176126,u4970,m330,RITA,Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
171586,L176125,u4960,m330,ED,What's going on over there?
171587,L177294,u4960,m330,ED,All right. Let them decide.
171588,L177293,u4968,m330,MR. SCHARLACH,"Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed."
171589,L177292,u4960,m330,ED,"Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?"
171590,L177291,u4968,m330,MR. SCHARLACH,"Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you."
171591,L177290,u4960,m330,ED,I can't?
171592,L177288,u4960,m330,ED,"All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!"
171593,L177287,u4968,m330,MR. SCHARLACH,"Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible."
171594,L176737,u4960,m330,ED,"I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. ""Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."""
171595,L176736,u4967,m330,MARCIA,"Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --"
171596,L176735,u4960,m330,ED,"Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's ""Star Search."" You wanted me here because the camera comes with me."
171597,L176732,u4960,m330,ED,"Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?"
171598,L176731,u4967,m330,MARCIA,What are you doing?
171599,L176242,u4967,m330,MARCIA,"Our foibles, our foibles!"
171600,L176241,u4960,m330,ED,Our what?
171601,L176240,u4967,m330,MARCIA,They're gonna mock our foibles.
171602,L176239,u4960,m330,ED,"No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from."
171603,L176434,u4960,m330,ED,I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
171604,L176433,u4961,m330,FELICIA,Never would be plenty.
171605,L176432,u4960,m330,ED,How much less?
171606,L176429,u4960,m330,ED,He's just ... trying a little too hard --
171607,L176428,u4961,m330,FELICIA,It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
171608,L176427,u4960,m330,ED,What does this mean?
171609,L176418,u4961,m330,FELICIA,"No, I mean..."
171610,L176417,u4960,m330,ED,Are you asking me?
171611,L176325,u4966,m330,LOU,"Welcome to work, Ed."
171612,L176324,u4960,m330,ED,"Hey, Lou."
171613,L176177,u4960,m330,ED,Who's in it?
171614,L176176,u4966,m330,LOU,"Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called ""Get your shit together before it's too late."""
171615,L176175,u4960,m330,ED,"Well, then I'm quitting."
171616,L176174,u4966,m330,LOU,"Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday."
171617,L176173,u4960,m330,ED,You batted or you bunted?
171618,L176172,u4966,m330,LOU,I batted!
171619,L176171,u4960,m330,ED,"Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?"
171620,L176170,u4966,m330,LOU,"Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry."
171621,L176169,u4960,m330,ED,What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
171622,L176168,u4966,m330,LOU,"Um, yeah, I was gonna ..."
171623,L177326,u4972,m330,SHARI,So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
171624,L177325,u4960,m330,ED,"But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?"
171625,L177324,u4960,m330,ED,"My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV."
171626,L177323,u4972,m330,SHARI,What do we have to do?
171627,L177322,u4960,m330,ED,Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
171628,L177310,u4960,m330,ED,It's nice.
171629,L177309,u4972,m330,SHARI,"My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut."
171630,L177308,u4960,m330,ED,What did you do to your hair?
171631,L177307,u4972,m330,SHARI,"You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner."
171632,L177306,u4972,m330,SHARI,"It's what I do. I yell ""Geronimo"" and jump out of a relationship."
171633,L177305,u4960,m330,ED,Kinda'.
171634,L176940,u4960,m330,ED,Come on.
171635,L176939,u4972,m330,SHARI,This is going right up your ass.
171636,L176935,u4960,m330,ED,"Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying ""oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes."" At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous."
171637,L176934,u4972,m330,SHARI,Everybody's someone.
171638,L176933,u4960,m330,ED,"You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say ""Hi"" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone."
171639,L176932,u4972,m330,SHARI,What?
171640,L176931,u4960,m330,ED,Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
171641,L176930,u4972,m330,SHARI,The what?
171642,L176929,u4960,m330,ED,No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
171643,L176928,u4972,m330,SHARI,No... Could you?
171644,L176927,u4960,m330,ED,What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
171645,L176926,u4972,m330,SHARI,No. It's your fault.
171646,L176925,u4960,m330,ED,It's not their fault.
171647,L176919,u4972,m330,SHARI,...yeah?
171648,L176918,u4960,m330,ED,"Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you."
171649,L176917,u4972,m330,SHARI,Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
171650,L176916,u4960,m330,ED,"She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - ""How do they find me"" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?"
171651,L176915,u4972,m330,SHARI,Are you all right?
171652,L176914,u4960,m330,ED,I need to talk.
171653,L176913,u4960,m330,ED,Come on...
171654,L176912,u4972,m330,SHARI,Okay.
171655,L176911,u4960,m330,ED,Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
171656,L176910,u4972,m330,SHARI,"I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone."
171657,L176907,u4960,m330,ED,Somewhere.
171658,L176906,u4972,m330,SHARI,Where?
171659,L176905,u4960,m330,ED,"Come on, let's go."
171660,L176904,u4972,m330,SHARI,I'm sorry.
171661,L176903,u4960,m330,ED,Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
171662,L176902,u4972,m330,SHARI,So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
171663,L176901,u4960,m330,ED,So?
171664,L176900,u4972,m330,SHARI,I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
171665,L176775,u4972,m330,SHARI,Ed?
171666,L176774,u4960,m330,ED,Really?
171667,L176773,u4972,m330,SHARI,There's a list.
171668,L176772,u4960,m330,ED,"Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  ""Is she good enough for Ed?"" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?"
171669,L176771,u4972,m330,SHARI,Twenty-nine.
171670,L176770,u4960,m330,ED,"Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other..."
171671,L176769,u4972,m330,SHARI,"A poll. ""Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?"" Seventy-one per cent said ""no.""  They hate me!"
171672,L176768,u4960,m330,ED,Ohh...
171673,L176767,u4972,m330,SHARI,Page three of the Post.

171677,L176763,u4960,m330,ED,Shari...
171678,L176762,u4972,m330,SHARI,I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
171679,L176758,u4972,m330,SHARI,Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
171680,L176757,u4960,m330,ED,So...?
171681,L176756,u4972,m330,SHARI,"... yeah, then, but..."
171682,L176755,u4960,m330,ED,...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
171683,L176754,u4972,m330,SHARI,I really like you too...

171686,L176751,u4960,m330,ED,So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
171687,L176750,u4972,m330,SHARI,"I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away."
171688,L176749,u4960,m330,ED,"I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done."
171689,L176748,u4960,m330,ED,What?
171690,L176747,u4972,m330,SHARI,Um...
171691,L176743,u4960,m330,ED,He could give me some oxygen.
171692,L176742,u4972,m330,SHARI,Why?
171693,L176741,u4960,m330,ED,I wish my stepfather was here.
171694,L176720,u4960,m330,ED,"Saturday, I think we should"
171695,L176719,u4972,m330,SHARI,That's lucky.
171696,L176718,u4960,m330,ED,Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
171697,L176672,u4960,m330,ED,It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
171698,L176671,u4972,m330,SHARI,Oh yeah.
171699,L176670,u4960,m330,ED,"You know, the big machine that cleans the ice."

171701,L176668,u4960,m330,ED,"Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni."
171702,L176667,u4972,m330,SHARI,You should see the one we wear when it rains.
171703,L176666,u4960,m330,ED,It's really a tremendous turnoff.
171704,L176665,u4972,m330,SHARI,"Yeah, well..."
171705,L176664,u4960,m330,ED,"You know, I never saw you in your uniform before."
171706,L176663,u4960,m330,ED,I missed you.
171707,L176662,u4972,m330,SHARI,What are you doing?
171708,L176545,u4960,m330,ED,Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
171709,L176544,u4972,m330,SHARI,"Oh God, this is so weird."
171710,L176543,u4960,m330,ED,Really?
171711,L176542,u4972,m330,SHARI,Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
171712,L176541,u4960,m330,ED,"Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?"

171717,L176528,u4972,m330,SHARI,Leave. Go.
171718,L176527,u4960,m330,ED,"Well, when you put it that way."
171719,L176526,u4972,m330,SHARI,I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
171720,L176525,u4960,m330,ED,It's... okay

171731,L176494,u4972,m330,SHARI,Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
171732,L176487,u4960,m330,ED,"Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then..."
171733,L176486,u4972,m330,SHARI,What do you want?!
171734,L176382,u4960,m330,ED,"No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, ""Boy Shari looks beautiful."" I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it."
171735,L176381,u4972,m330,SHARI,Right.
171736,L176380,u4960,m330,ED,"You do though, you look great."
171737,L176269,u4972,m330,SHARI,Dynamite is dangerous.
171738,L176268,u4960,m330,ED,So maybe this is my dynamite.

171742,L176264,u4960,m330,ED,"I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?"
171743,L176263,u4972,m330,SHARI,Why do it?
171744,L176262,u4960,m330,ED,"Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here."
171745,L176261,u4972,m330,SHARI,Are you sure about this?
171746,L176148,u4960,m330,ED,"Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you."
171747,L176147,u4972,m330,SHARI,"Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me."
171748,L176146,u4960,m330,ED,I hear the dog really liked him.
171749,L176145,u4972,m330,SHARI,Yeah...
171750,L177340,u4960,m330,ED,"A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy."
171751,L177339,u4969,m330,RAY,"And each contestant gets one of these.  An ""I tried to screw a network executive"" tee-shirt."
171752,L177262,u4969,m330,RAY,"I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault."
171753,L177261,u4960,m330,ED,Me?! That's you!
171754,L177260,u4969,m330,RAY,I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
171755,L177259,u4960,m330,ED,"Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like ""We grew up in a small, little bedroom."" As opposed to a big, little bedroom?"
171756,L177258,u4969,m330,RAY,You know what your problem is?
171757,L177257,u4960,m330,ED,"Let's remember how I got into this. ""Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break."""
171758,L177256,u4969,m330,RAY,"Come on, Ma."
171759,L177226,u4960,m330,ED,"I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back."
171760,L177225,u4969,m330,RAY,That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
171761,L177224,u4960,m330,ED,Me?!
171762,L177223,u4969,m330,RAY,"Cliff left her, thanks to you."
171763,L176626,u4960,m330,ED,"Ray, come an--"

171768,L176611,u4960,m330,ED,"Look, we gotta talk."
171769,L176610,u4969,m330,RAY,I know.
171770,L176609,u4960,m330,ED,"Oh, man, I've been trying to call you."
171771,L176608,u4969,m330,RAY,Yeah.
171772,L176607,u4960,m330,ED,... Ray?

171956,L179147,u4976,m331,DAVE,Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
171957,L179146,u4979,m331,JIM,"You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy."
171958,L179144,u4976,m331,DAVE,She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
171959,L179143,u4979,m331,JIM,Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
171960,L179142,u4979,m331,JIM,"A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny."
171961,L179166,u4976,m331,DAVE,"Here, get down."
171962,L179165,u4988,m331,TRACY,"It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows."
171963,L179161,u4976,m331,DAVE,"And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness."
171964,L179160,u4988,m331,TRACY,Thank you.
171965,L179159,u4976,m331,DAVE,"Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special."
171966,L179158,u4976,m331,DAVE,What kind of person?
171967,L179157,u4988,m331,TRACY,What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
171968,L179156,u4976,m331,DAVE,"I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to."
171969,L179155,u4988,m331,TRACY,"No, I'm not. I'm just really busy."
171970,L179154,u4976,m331,DAVE,"Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner."
171971,L179153,u4988,m331,TRACY,what?
171972,L179152,u4976,m331,DAVE,"You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but..."
171973,L179151,u4988,m331,TRACY,"One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults."
171974,L179373,u4979,m331,JIM,"Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes."
171975,L179372,u4977,m331,DIANE,What?
171976,L179371,u4979,m331,JIM,"Yeah. No. I mean, you know."
171977,L179370,u4977,m331,DIANE,You guys have fun?
171978,L179369,u4979,m331,JIM,Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
171979,L179368,u4977,m331,DIANE,How'd it go?
171980,L179345,u4977,m331,DIANE,Do it!
171981,L179344,u4979,m331,JIM,"Yeah, just --"
171982,L179343,u4977,m331,DIANE,"Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up"
171983,L179342,u4979,m331,JIM,"Yeah, uh, just a minute"
171984,L179341,u4977,m331,DIANE,You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
171985,L179335,u4979,m331,JIM,He likes it.
171986,L179334,u4977,m331,DIANE,"Jim, don't.  You're scaring him."
171987,L179333,u4979,m331,JIM,"Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time."
171988,L179230,u4979,m331,JIM,"Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school."
171989,L179229,u4977,m331,DIANE,Anything wrong?
171990,L179228,u4979,m331,JIM,"Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication."
171991,L179717,u4980,m331,JO,So nice
171992,L179716,u4978,m331,DICK,"All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you."
171993,L179703,u4980,m331,JO,Dick.
171994,L179702,u4978,m331,DICK,Having a problem with your eye there?
171995,L179563,u4978,m331,DICK,You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
171996,L179562,u4980,m331,JO,"Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --"
171997,L179561,u4978,m331,DICK,What?
171998,L179560,u4980,m331,JO,"Dick... Dick,.."
171999,L179559,u4978,m331,DICK,"Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!"
172000,L179678,u4981,m331,LARRY,"But, Mr. M. -"
172001,L179677,u4979,m331,JIM,"Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -"
172002,L179674,u4981,m331,LARRY,I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
172003,L179673,u4979,m331,JIM,"It happens, Larry. People make mistakes."
172004,L179672,u4981,m331,LARRY,"But, they were there I counted 803 votes."
172005,L179671,u4979,m331,JIM,He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
172006,L179670,u4981,m331,LARRY,"See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register."
172007,L179669,u4979,m331,JIM,Mostly Tammy fans
172008,L179663,u4979,m331,JIM,I think we've got a problem.
172009,L179662,u4981,m331,LARRY,Yeah?
172010,L179661,u4979,m331,JIM,Larry?
172011,L179653,u4979,m331,JIM,"Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count."
172012,L179652,u4981,m331,LARRY,Mr. M.?
172013,L179650,u4979,m331,JIM,"Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won."
172014,L179649,u4981,m331,LARRY,"I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --"
172015,L179648,u4979,m331,JIM,"You're kidding, right?"
172016,L179647,u4981,m331,LARRY,I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
172017,L179646,u4979,m331,JIM,What d'you got?
172018,L179633,u4979,m331,JIM,All right.  I'll be back
172019,L179632,u4981,m331,LARRY,Okay.  Yeah.  We know
172020,L179631,u4979,m331,JIM,"I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know."
172021,L179626,u4981,m331,LARRY,"You have the key, Mr. McAllister."
172022,L179625,u4979,m331,JIM,"Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back."
172023,L179624,u4981,m331,LARRY,"Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts."
172024,L179623,u4979,m331,JIM,What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
172025,L179840,u4979,m331,JIM,You will.
172026,L179839,u4988,m331,TRACY,I hope so
172027,L179838,u4979,m331,JIM,You'll be fine.
172028,L179837,u4988,m331,TRACY,"I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college."
172029,L179836,u4988,m331,TRACY,Take as much room as you want
172030,L179835,u4979,m331,JIM,What a surprise.
172031,L179834,u4988,m331,TRACY,Would you sign it for me?
172032,L179833,u4979,m331,JIM,"Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time."
172033,L179832,u4988,m331,TRACY,I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
172034,L179831,u4979,m331,JIM,"Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him."
172035,L179830,u4988,m331,TRACY,I want you to do something for me.
172036,L179828,u4988,m331,TRACY,My house.
172037,L179827,u4979,m331,JIM,What's this?
172038,L179826,u4988,m331,TRACY,I've got an idea.
172039,L179825,u4979,m331,JIM,"Well, I... I... that's very nice of you."
172040,L179824,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?"
172041,L179823,u4979,m331,JIM,Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
172042,L179822,u4988,m331,TRACY,Doing what?
172043,L179821,u4979,m331,JIM,Why are you doing this?
172044,L179820,u4988,m331,TRACY,Yes?
172045,L179819,u4979,m331,JIM,So Tracy?
172046,L179818,u4988,m331,TRACY,That sounds good.
172047,L179817,u4979,m331,JIM,And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
172048,L179816,u4988,m331,TRACY,Uh-huh.
172049,L179815,u4979,m331,JIM,"Plenty of pep, too."
172050,L179814,u4988,m331,TRACY,Yeah.
172051,L179813,u4979,m331,JIM,"Handles pretty good, don't you think?"
172052,L179812,u4979,m331,JIM,Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
172053,L179811,u4988,m331,TRACY,Where to?
172054,L179810,u4988,m331,TRACY,Sporty.
172055,L179809,u4979,m331,JIM,"So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?"
172056,L179808,u4979,m331,JIM,Good for you.  Good for you
172057,L179807,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice."
172058,L179806,u4979,m331,JIM,Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
172059,L179805,u4988,m331,TRACY,My mother's buying me a new car for college.
172060,L179804,u4979,m331,JIM,"Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place"
172061,L179803,u4988,m331,TRACY,I'm looking at new cars.
172062,L179802,u4979,m331,JIM,So what brings you here?
172063,L179801,u4979,m331,JIM,"Hello, Tracy."
172064,L179800,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Hello, Mr. M."
172065,L179687,u4979,m331,JIM,"That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president."
172066,L179686,u4988,m331,TRACY,Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
172067,L179539,u4979,m331,JIM,"That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?"
172068,L179538,u4988,m331,TRACY,I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
172069,L179537,u4979,m331,JIM,You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
172070,L179536,u4988,m331,TRACY,What do you mean?
172071,L179535,u4979,m331,JIM,Looks like today's your lucky day
172072,L179534,u4988,m331,TRACY,Yes?
172073,L179506,u4988,m331,TRACY,"And I think certain older persons like you and your ""colleague"" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present."
172074,L179505,u4979,m331,JIM,"I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections."
172075,L179504,u4988,m331,TRACY,"I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay."
172076,L179503,u4979,m331,JIM,"This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand."
172077,L179502,u4988,m331,TRACY,Why are you lecturing me?
172078,L179501,u4979,m331,JIM,"You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself."
172079,L179500,u4988,m331,TRACY,"well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that."
172080,L179499,u4979,m331,JIM,"Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we ""interrogate?"""
172081,L179498,u4988,m331,TRACY,"I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this."
172082,L179497,u4979,m331,JIM,6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
172083,L179496,u4988,m331,TRACY,"I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30."
172084,L179495,u4979,m331,JIM,Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
172085,L179494,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?"
172086,L179493,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!"
172087,L179492,u4979,m331,JIM,"A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it."
172088,L179491,u4988,m331,TRACY,"If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty."
172089,L179490,u4979,m331,JIM,I guess you know why you're here
172090,L179397,u4979,m331,JIM,"Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine."
172091,L179396,u4988,m331,TRACY,Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
172092,L179390,u4979,m331,JIM,Looks like Tim Kobza.
172093,L179389,u4988,m331,TRACY,"These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one."
172094,L179384,u4979,m331,JIM,"As far as I know, they--"
172095,L179383,u4988,m331,TRACY,Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
172096,L179382,u4979,m331,JIM,"Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down."
172097,L179381,u4988,m331,TRACY,You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
172098,L179378,u4979,m331,JIM,"So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life."
172099,L179377,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Fuck me, Mr. McAllister"
172100,L179225,u4979,m331,JIM,"Good luck, Tracy."
172101,L179224,u4988,m331,TRACY,Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
172102,L179223,u4979,m331,JIM,Sure
172103,L179222,u4988,m331,TRACY,"You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?"
172104,L179221,u4979,m331,JIM,"Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy"
172105,L179220,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one."
172106,L179219,u4979,m331,JIM,Should be easy.  So far no competition.
172107,L179218,u4988,m331,TRACY,I can't wait to start campaigning.
172108,L179217,u4979,m331,JIM,You bet.
172109,L179216,u4988,m331,TRACY,Thanks for everything.
172110,L179215,u4979,m331,JIM,"Okay, fine. Sure"
172111,L179214,u4988,m331,TRACY,I thought you were supposed to keep them.
172112,L179213,u4979,m331,JIM,"NO, that's fine"
172113,L179212,u4988,m331,TRACY,Aren't you supposed to keep them?
172114,L179211,u4979,m331,JIM,Looks good to me.
172115,L179210,u4979,m331,JIM,Right
172116,L179209,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning."
172117,L179208,u4979,m331,JIM,You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
172118,L179207,u4988,m331,TRACY,Here they are.
172119,L179206,u4979,m331,JIM,"Hey, that's super"
172120,L179205,u4988,m331,TRACY,I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
172121,L179140,u4979,m331,JIM,Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
172122,L179139,u4988,m331,TRACY,...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
172123,L179138,u4979,m331,JIM,"Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed."
172124,L179125,u4988,m331,TRACY,Ethics are...
172125,L179124,u4979,m331,JIM,Tracy.
172126,L179123,u4988,m331,TRACY,I know.
172127,L179122,u4979,m331,JIM,Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
172128,L179099,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Thanks, Mr. M."
172129,L179098,u4979,m331,JIM,"Well, good luck there, Tracy"
172130,L179097,u4979,m331,JIM,"Yes, I do."
172131,L179096,u4988,m331,TRACY,You know what they say about the early bird.
172132,L179095,u4979,m331,JIM,"Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?"
172133,L179094,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Good morning, Mr. McAllister."
172134,L179483,u4979,m331,JIM,"Oh yeah, you bet."
172135,L179482,u4989,m331,WALT,"Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?"
172136,L179472,u4989,m331,WALT,Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
172137,L179471,u4979,m331,JIM,Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
172138,L179470,u4989,m331,WALT,"Jim, where the hell have you been?"
172139,L179418,u4989,m331,WALT,Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
172140,L179417,u4979,m331,JIM,"Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about."
172141,L179416,u4989,m331,WALT,"That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up."
172142,L179760,u4979,m331,JIM,Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
172143,L179759,u4983,m331,MISS BEEDER,"Okay, Jim. I understand."
172144,L179758,u4979,m331,JIM,"Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer."
172145,L179737,u4979,m331,JIM,Oh.  Okay.
172146,L179736,u4983,m331,MISS BEEDER,Walt needs to see you.
172147,L179735,u4979,m331,JIM,Hmm?
172148,L179734,u4983,m331,MISS BEEDER,"Uh, Jim?"
172149,L179733,u4979,m331,JIM,"Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience."
172150,L179530,u4987,m331,TAMMY,I have proof.
172151,L179529,u4979,m331,JIM,I don't believe you.
172152,L179528,u4987,m331,TAMMY,I don't know. All I know is I did it I
172153,L179527,u4979,m331,JIM,Which door?
172154,L179526,u4987,m331,TAMMY,Door was open.
172155,L179525,u4979,m331,JIM,And how did you get in the school?
172156,L179524,u4987,m331,TAMMY,I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
172157,L179523,u4979,m331,JIM,Exactly when?
172158,L179522,u4987,m331,TAMMY,This weekend.
172159,L179521,u4979,m331,JIM,And when did you do it?
172160,L179520,u4987,m331,TAMMY,I did it.
172161,L179519,u4979,m331,JIM,Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
172162,L179518,u4987,m331,TAMMY,I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
172163,L179517,u4979,m331,JIM,What is it. Tammy?
172164,L179516,u4987,m331,TAMMY,"Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?"
172165,L179515,u4979,m331,JIM,So... what do you have to tell me?
172166,L179512,u4987,m331,TAMMY,Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
172167,L179511,u4979,m331,JIM,Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
172168,L179510,u4987,m331,TAMMY,Okay.  But is this about the posters?
172169,L179509,u4979,m331,JIM,Just wait outside. Tammy.
172170,L179508,u4987,m331,TAMMY,"You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?"
172171,L179644,u4979,m331,JIM,Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
172172,L179643,u4986,m331,SHERRY,I was lonely.  You took advantage
172173,L179642,u4979,m331,JIM,A mistake?  That was no mistake.
172174,L179641,u4986,m331,SHERRY,We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
172175,L179640,u4979,m331,JIM,It's the only true thing I know anymore.
172176,L179639,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
172177,L179638,u4979,m331,JIM,Sherry... I love you.
172178,L179637,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Yeah.  I'm here.
172179,L179636,u4979,m331,JIM,You're there.
172180,L179635,u4986,m331,SHERRY,"What do you want, Jim?"
172181,L179462,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Three twenty-five.
172182,L179461,u4979,m331,JIM,Three twenty-five.
172183,L179460,u4986,m331,SHERRY,"Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter."
172184,L179459,u4979,m331,JIM,Right now?
172185,L179458,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
172186,L179457,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Hey Yeah?
172187,L179453,u4979,m331,JIM,We'll let it run awhile
172188,L179452,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Yep.
172189,L179451,u4979,m331,JIM,Still clear?
172190,L179450,u4986,m331,SHERRY,All his life.  He's tried everything.
172191,L179449,u4979,m331,JIM,"No, I... uh, didn't know that"
172192,L179448,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
172193,L179447,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Dave.
172194,L179446,u4979,m331,JIM,Shall we give it a name?
172195,L179366,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Oh.
172196,L179365,u4979,m331,JIM,points at the motel.
172197,L179364,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Should we get a what?
172198,L179363,u4979,m331,JIM,So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
172199,L179362,u4986,m331,SHERRY,You sure?
172200,L179361,u4979,m331,JIM,"Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little."
172201,L179360,u4986,m331,SHERRY,I can't afford this stuff right now.
172202,L179354,u4979,m331,JIM,Okay.  Give me the drill.
172203,L179353,u4986,m331,SHERRY,More this way.
172204,L179352,u4979,m331,JIM,Here?
172205,L179351,u4979,m331,JIM,Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
172206,L179350,u4979,m331,JIM,Sure.
172207,L179349,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Could you get this? I can't
172208,L179190,u4986,m331,SHERRY,Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
172209,L179189,u4979,m331,JIM,"After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce."
172210,L179724,u4979,m331,JIM,Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
172211,L179723,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard."
172212,L179722,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry."
172213,L179721,u4979,m331,JIM,"Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home."
172214,L179720,u4985,m331,PAUL,"And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -"
172215,L179715,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff."
172216,L179714,u4979,m331,JIM,"Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home."
172217,L179263,u4979,m331,JIM,Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
172218,L179262,u4985,m331,PAUL,I also like bananas.
172219,L179261,u4979,m331,JIM,"Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy."
172220,L179260,u4985,m331,PAUL,"No, wait -- apples.  Apples."
172221,L179259,u4979,m331,JIM,"Okay, let's say"
172222,L179258,u4979,m331,JIM,takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
172223,L179257,u4985,m331,PAUL,Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
172224,L179256,u4979,m331,JIM,"Paul, what's your favorite fruit?"
172225,L179255,u4979,m331,JIM,"Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied."
172226,L179254,u4985,m331,PAUL,And she's super-nice
172227,L179253,u4979,m331,JIM,"Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right."
172228,L179252,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --"
172229,L179250,u4979,m331,JIM,"Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?"
172230,L179249,u4985,m331,PAUL,What do you mean?
172231,L179248,u4979,m331,JIM,"But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports."
172232,L179247,u4985,m331,PAUL,Yeah.
172233,L179246,u4979,m331,JIM,I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
172234,L179245,u4985,m331,PAUL,I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
172235,L179244,u4979,m331,JIM,"Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident."
172236,L179742,u4989,m331,WALT,"Larry, you just take it easy"
172237,L179741,u4981,m331,LARRY,"You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --"
172238,L179676,u4981,m331,LARRY,"I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for."
172239,L179675,u4989,m331,WALT,"Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going."
172240,L179668,u4989,m331,WALT,If you say so.
172241,L179667,u4981,m331,LARRY,"And 290 ""disregards,"" right?"
172242,L179666,u4989,m331,WALT,"Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy."
172243,L179665,u4981,m331,LARRY,No way I It doesn't make sense.
172244,L179664,u4989,m331,WALT,253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
172245,L179318,u4982,m331,LISA,"Well, I do."
172246,L179317,u4987,m331,TAMMY,I don't care.
172247,L179316,u4982,m331,LISA,But other people can see them too.
172248,L179315,u4987,m331,TAMMY,I know.
172249,L179314,u4982,m331,LISA,These are private -- these are for us.
172250,L179313,u4987,m331,TAMMY,So?
172251,L179312,u4982,m331,LISA,People can see this.
172252,L179311,u4987,m331,TAMMY,What?
172253,L179310,u4982,m331,LISA,Are you crazy?
172254,L179301,u4982,m331,LISA,"I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting."
172255,L179300,u4987,m331,TAMMY,What...?
172256,L179299,u4982,m331,LISA,I'm not like you.
172257,L179298,u4987,m331,TAMMY,Where 're you going?
172258,L179284,u4982,m331,LISA,"I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?"
172259,L179283,u4987,m331,TAMMY,What?
172260,L179481,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she..."
172261,L179480,u4982,m331,LISA,It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
172262,L179479,u4985,m331,PAUL,"We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --"
172263,L179395,u4982,m331,LISA,I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
172264,L179394,u4985,m331,PAUL,For what?
172265,L179393,u4982,m331,LISA,I mean at you.
172266,L179392,u4985,m331,PAUL,For what?
172267,L179391,u4982,m331,LISA,She's doing this to get back at me
172268,L179386,u4982,m331,LISA,It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
172269,L179385,u4985,m331,PAUL,"We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?"
172270,L179327,u4982,m331,LISA,Sorry.
172271,L179326,u4985,m331,PAUL,Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
172272,L179788,u4988,m331,TRACY,Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
172273,L179787,u4985,m331,PAUL,Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
172274,L179786,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Yes, Paul?"
172275,L179782,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*"
172276,L179781,u4988,m331,TRACY,Can I sign yours too?
172277,L179780,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Sure, Tracy."
172278,L179779,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Paul, will you sign my yearbook?"
172279,L179683,u4985,m331,PAUL,"You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me."
172280,L179682,u4988,m331,TRACY,Yeah.
172281,L179681,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over."
172282,L179680,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you."
172283,L179620,u4985,m331,PAUL,Thanks!
172284,L179619,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Good luck to you too, Paul."
172285,L179618,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Hell, good luck!"
172286,L179617,u4988,m331,TRACY,Yeah.
172287,L179616,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?"
172288,L179277,u4988,m331,TRACY,"Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on."
172289,L179276,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --"
172290,L179275,u4988,m331,TRACY,So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
172291,L179274,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --"
172292,L179273,u4988,m331,TRACY,Thought what?
172293,L179272,u4985,m331,PAUL,"No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --"
172294,L179271,u4988,m331,TRACY,You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
172295,L179270,u4985,m331,PAUL,What do you mean?
172296,L179269,u4988,m331,TRACY,Who put you up to this?
172297,L179268,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy"
172298,L179267,u4988,m331,TRACY,Who put you up to this?
172299,L179434,u4985,m331,PAUL,Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
172300,L179433,u4987,m331,TAMMY,"Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings."
172301,L179432,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same."
172302,L179431,u4987,m331,TAMMY,Now could you leave me alone?
172303,L179430,u4987,m331,TAMMY,"Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot."
172304,L179429,u4985,m331,PAUL,"I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -"
172305,L179428,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments."
172306,L179427,u4987,m331,TAMMY,What do you want?
172307,L179295,u4987,m331,TAMMY,"You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing."
172308,L179294,u4985,m331,PAUL,What'd I do?
172309,L179293,u4987,m331,TAMMY,You dumbshit!
172310,L179291,u4985,m331,PAUL,So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
172311,L179290,u4987,m331,TAMMY,"Paul, get out!"
172312,L179289,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa."
172313,L179288,u4987,m331,TAMMY,Don't you fucking knock?
172314,L179287,u4985,m331,PAUL,"Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today."
172315,L182028,u4999,m332,JACK,You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
172316,L182027,u4990,m332,BOXER,You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
172317,L182026,u4999,m332,JACK,We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
172318,L182025,u4999,m332,JACK,How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
172319,L182024,u4990,m332,BOXER,Till 19-fucking-70.
172320,L182023,u4999,m332,JACK,You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
172321,L182022,u4990,m332,BOXER,"What do you want, Mr. Policeman?"
172322,L182021,u4999,m332,JACK,I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
172323,L182020,u4990,m332,BOXER,What's it to you?
172324,L182019,u4999,m332,JACK,How's the left these days?
172325,L182548,u4991,m332,BUD,No.  Now.  You fucked him.
172326,L182547,u5001,m332,LYNN,In the morning.
172327,L182546,u4991,m332,BUD,So tell me about it.
172328,L182545,u5001,m332,LYNN,We talked.
172329,L182544,u4991,m332,BUD,You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
172330,L182543,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Come in out of the rain, Bud."
172331,L182542,u4991,m332,BUD,How'd you get to know so much about him?
172332,L182541,u5001,m332,LYNN,"He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating."
172333,L182540,u4991,m332,BUD,I want to know about Exley.
172334,L182539,u5001,m332,LYNN,Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
172335,L182538,u4991,m332,BUD,Did you talk to Exley?
172336,L182272,u4991,m332,BUD,"That simple, huh?"
172337,L182271,u5001,m332,LYNN,You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
172338,L182268,u4991,m332,BUD,"I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective..."
172339,L182267,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Do you like being a cop, Bud?"
172340,L182266,u4991,m332,BUD,Yeah.  But not for long.
172341,L182265,u5001,m332,LYNN,So you saved her.
172342,L182264,u4991,m332,BUD,"When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way."
172343,L182263,u5001,m332,LYNN,It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
172344,L182240,u4991,m332,BUD,It's Bud.
172345,L182239,u5001,m332,LYNN,"I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White."
172346,L182083,u4991,m332,BUD,Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
172347,L182082,u5001,m332,LYNN,If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
172348,L182081,u4991,m332,BUD,I don't know.
172349,L182080,u5001,m332,LYNN,Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
172350,L182079,u4991,m332,BUD,Look.  I want to see you again.
172351,L182077,u5001,m332,LYNN,"No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print."
172352,L182076,u4991,m332,BUD,He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
172353,L182075,u5001,m332,LYNN,He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
172354,L182074,u4991,m332,BUD,"You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>."
172355,L182073,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute."
172356,L182072,u4991,m332,BUD,"Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today."
172357,L182071,u5001,m332,LYNN,But you did it anyway.
172358,L182070,u4991,m332,BUD,I'm not sure.
172359,L182069,u5001,m332,LYNN,Did they deserve it today?
172360,L182068,u4991,m332,BUD,When they deserve it.
172361,L182067,u5001,m332,LYNN,Do you enjoy it?
172362,L182066,u4991,m332,BUD,Yeah.
172363,L182065,u5001,m332,LYNN,There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
172364,L182064,u4991,m332,BUD,You fuck for money.
172365,L182063,u5001,m332,LYNN,You say 'fuck' a lot.
172366,L182062,u4991,m332,BUD,Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
172367,L182061,u5001,m332,LYNN,"I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?"
172368,L182060,u4991,m332,BUD,"Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears."
172369,L182059,u5001,m332,LYNN,It's Lynn.
172370,L182058,u4991,m332,BUD,"You want some advice, Miss Bracken?"
172371,L182057,u5001,m332,LYNN,He's waiting for you to mention mention.
172372,L182056,u4991,m332,BUD,Tell me about Patchett.
172373,L182055,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little."
172374,L182054,u4991,m332,BUD,How'd she meet Patchett?
172375,L182053,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Like I said we were friendly, not friends."
172376,L182052,u4991,m332,BUD,Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
172377,L182051,u5001,m332,LYNN,I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
172378,L182050,u4991,m332,BUD,Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
172379,L182049,u5001,m332,LYNN,"That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating."
172380,L182048,u4991,m332,BUD,"Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention."
172381,L182047,u5001,m332,LYNN,Yes.  But do you know?
172382,L182046,u4991,m332,BUD,"You use words like that, you might make me mad."
172383,L182045,u5001,m332,LYNN,No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
172384,L182044,u4991,m332,BUD,Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
172385,L182043,u5001,m332,LYNN,Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
172386,L182042,u4991,m332,BUD,Are you sorry she's dead?
172387,L182041,u5001,m332,LYNN,"I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?"
172388,L182040,u4991,m332,BUD,"Yeah, plain scotch."
172389,L182039,u5001,m332,LYNN,Can I get you a drink?
172390,L181716,u5001,m332,LYNN,It's not what you think.
172391,L181715,u4991,m332,BUD,Somebody hit you?
172392,L181706,u5001,m332,LYNN,It's practically stamped on your forehead.
172393,L181705,u4991,m332,BUD,"That obvious, huh?"
172394,L181704,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>."
172395,L181703,u4991,m332,BUD,Merry Christmas.
172396,L182501,u4991,m332,BUD,"Sure, boss.  Sure you can."
172397,L182500,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?"
172398,L182499,u4991,m332,BUD,"You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about."
172399,L182498,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad."
172400,L182497,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell."
172401,L182496,u4991,m332,BUD,What work?
172402,L182495,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp."
172403,L182165,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"You've got it, Wendell."
172404,L182164,u4991,m332,BUD,Give me one minute.
172405,L181868,u4991,m332,BUD,How'd you get them to retract?
172406,L181867,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"How what, Wendell?"
172407,L181866,u4991,m332,BUD,Of course... But how?
172408,L181865,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Will you work for me?
172409,L181862,u4991,m332,BUD,Homicide?  A detective?
172410,L181861,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide."
172411,L181860,u4991,m332,BUD,How?
172412,L181859,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
172413,L181858,u4991,m332,BUD,"I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?"
172414,L181857,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,They're yours.  Take them.
172415,L181856,u4991,m332,BUD,Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
172416,L181855,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Wendell, I want you to come to work for me."
172417,L181854,u4991,m332,BUD,<u>What do you want</u>?
172418,L181853,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
172419,L181852,u4991,m332,BUD,Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
172420,L181851,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing."
172421,L181850,u4991,m332,BUD,He helped me out once.  That's all.
172422,L181849,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?"
172423,L181848,u4991,m332,BUD,What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
172424,L181847,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
172425,L181846,u4991,m332,BUD,"Yeah, I hate them."
172426,L181845,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?"
172427,L181844,u4991,m332,BUD,"Dudley, what do you want?"
172428,L181843,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Call me Dudley.
172429,L181842,u4991,m332,BUD,"Captain, what do you want?"
172430,L181841,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
172431,L181840,u4991,m332,BUD,Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
172432,L181839,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
172433,L181838,u4991,m332,BUD,"This business, Captain?"
172434,L181837,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Lad, may I have a word with you?"
172435,L181918,u5007,m332,STENSLAND,"It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it."
172436,L181917,u4991,m332,BUD,What are you talking about?
172437,L181916,u5007,m332,STENSLAND,No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
172438,L181915,u4991,m332,BUD,What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
172439,L181914,u5007,m332,STENSLAND,"Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight."
172440,L181913,u4991,m332,BUD,"Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?"
172441,L181912,u5007,m332,STENSLAND,"Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good."
172442,L181756,u4991,m332,BUD,I got to write my report first.
172443,L181755,u5007,m332,STENSLAND,"Hey, partner.  Grab a cup."
172444,L181722,u5007,m332,STENSLAND,Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
172445,L181721,u4991,m332,BUD,You know him?
172446,L182323,u4991,m332,BUD,Yeah.  A great big one.
172447,L182322,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,Was it... a rat?
172448,L182320,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
172449,L182319,u4991,m332,BUD,Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
172450,L182318,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
172451,L182317,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,No!  Please leave!
172452,L182316,u4991,m332,BUD,What's through here?
172453,L182314,u4991,m332,BUD,"You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?"
172454,L182313,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,That's him.  That's him.
172455,L182312,u4991,m332,BUD,Look at a picture for me.
172456,L182311,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,Maybe.  I don't know.
172457,L182310,u4991,m332,BUD,Stens?  Was it Stens?
172458,L182309,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
172459,L182308,u4991,m332,BUD,What was that boyfriend's name?
172460,L182307,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,"Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus."
172461,L182306,u4991,m332,BUD,"Ma'am, I'm sure she was."
172462,L182305,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
172463,L182304,u4991,m332,BUD,Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
172464,L182303,u4991,m332,BUD,Five minutes.  That's all.
172465,L182302,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,Let my daughter rest in peace.
172466,L182301,u4991,m332,BUD,"Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions."
172467,L182649,u4991,m332,BUD,I spent years trying not to live down to mine.
172468,L182648,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father."
172469,L182647,u4991,m332,BUD,A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
172470,L182646,u4997,m332,EXLEY,You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
172471,L182642,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
172472,L182641,u4991,m332,BUD,You wanted to meet here?
172473,L182625,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn."
172474,L182624,u4991,m332,BUD,They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
172475,L182618,u4991,m332,BUD,"If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all."
172476,L182617,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Bud...
172477,L182599,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
172478,L182598,u4991,m332,BUD,What about him?
172479,L182597,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Ellis Loew.
172480,L182590,u4991,m332,BUD,<u>Lynn</u>.
172481,L182589,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
172482,L182588,u4991,m332,BUD,At least not anymore.
172483,L182587,u4997,m332,EXLEY,We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
172484,L182586,u4991,m332,BUD,He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
172485,L182585,u4997,m332,EXLEY,It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
172486,L182581,u4991,m332,BUD,Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
172487,L182580,u4997,m332,EXLEY,You expecting problems?
172488,L182579,u4991,m332,BUD,Which one are you and which one am I?
172489,L182578,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
172490,L182577,u4997,m332,EXLEY,With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
172491,L182576,u4991,m332,BUD,There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
172492,L182575,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules."
172493,L182574,u4991,m332,BUD,"For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice."
172494,L182573,u4997,m332,EXLEY,What?
172495,L182572,u4991,m332,BUD,Let's just kill them.
172496,L182571,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett."
172497,L182570,u4997,m332,EXLEY,It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
172498,L182569,u4991,m332,BUD,It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
172499,L182568,u4997,m332,EXLEY,They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
172500,L182567,u4991,m332,BUD,Dudley's guys.
172501,L182566,u4997,m332,EXLEY,The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
172502,L182565,u4991,m332,BUD,Dudley.
172503,L182564,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?"
172504,L182563,u4991,m332,BUD,"Somebody got wind of it, killed them all."
172505,L182562,u4997,m332,EXLEY,The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
172506,L182561,u4991,m332,BUD,"Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down."
172507,L182560,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus."
172508,L182559,u4991,m332,BUD,"Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot."
172509,L182558,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
172510,L182557,u4991,m332,BUD,"I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them."
172511,L182552,u4997,m332,EXLEY,She told you?
172512,L182551,u4991,m332,BUD,Lynn.
172513,L182550,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Why?
172514,L182172,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard."
172515,L182171,u4991,m332,BUD,It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
172516,L182170,u4997,m332,EXLEY,How's it going to look on your report?
172517,L182169,u4991,m332,BUD,Get the fuck away from me.
172518,L182168,u4997,m332,EXLEY,A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
172519,L182161,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Officer White, put down that weapon and --"
172520,L182160,u4991,m332,BUD,One in six.  Where's the girl?
172521,L181954,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people."
172522,L181953,u4991,m332,BUD,What happened?
172523,L181952,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
172524,L181951,u4991,m332,BUD,"Yeah, that's Stens."
172525,L181947,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?"
172526,L181946,u4991,m332,BUD,Where are we going?
172527,L182015,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,"Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?"
172528,L182014,u4991,m332,BUD,I got her address.
172529,L182013,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,"No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --"
172530,L182012,u4991,m332,BUD,That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
172531,L182011,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,"There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon."
172532,L182010,u4991,m332,BUD,What little studio?
172533,L182009,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
172534,L182008,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,Wait.  Our deal still holds?
172535,L182007,u4991,m332,BUD,You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
172536,L182006,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
172537,L182005,u4991,m332,BUD,Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
172538,L182004,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,"Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling."
172539,L182003,u4991,m332,BUD,That's right.
172540,L182002,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
172541,L182001,u4991,m332,BUD,No.
172542,L182000,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
172543,L181999,u4991,m332,BUD,"I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?"
172544,L181998,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,Against your code?
172545,L181997,u4991,m332,BUD,"Thanks, but no thanks."
172546,L181996,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,"He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>."
172547,L181995,u4991,m332,BUD,Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
172548,L181992,u4991,m332,BUD,Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
172549,L181991,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,Of course...
172550,L181990,u4991,m332,BUD,We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
172551,L181989,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
172552,L181988,u4991,m332,BUD,Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
172553,L181987,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,I don't know him.  Mr...
172554,L181986,u4991,m332,BUD,Richard Stensland.
172555,L181985,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,"I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?"
172556,L181984,u4991,m332,BUD,I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
172557,L181983,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,"I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office."
172558,L181982,u4991,m332,BUD,Are you Pierce Patchett?
172559,L181714,u4991,m332,BUD,I'm not asking you.
172560,L181713,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,She's fine.
172561,L182386,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,I don't know.  I swear it!
172562,L182385,u4991,m332,BUD,"He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?"
172563,L182384,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
172564,L182383,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,"Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing."
172565,L182382,u4991,m332,BUD,Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
172566,L182381,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
172567,L182380,u4991,m332,BUD,How 'bout I give you your balls back?
172568,L182379,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,More's gonna cost you.
172569,L182378,u4991,m332,BUD,More.
172570,L182377,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,"Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared."
172571,L182376,u4991,m332,BUD,His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
172572,L182375,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,Should I?
172573,L182374,u4991,m332,BUD,You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
172574,L182373,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,"What do you want, <u>officer</u>?"
172575,L182372,u4991,m332,BUD,"I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker."
172576,L182371,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,"Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?"
172577,L181654,u4991,m332,BUD,"And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?"
172578,L181653,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
172579,L182300,u5005,m332,PINKER,"Yeah, so..."
172580,L182299,u4991,m332,BUD,It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
172581,L182298,u5005,m332,PINKER,What do you mean?
172582,L182297,u4991,m332,BUD,It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
172583,L182296,u5005,m332,PINKER,Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
172584,L182295,u4991,m332,BUD,<u>Ear plugs</u>.
172585,L182294,u5005,m332,PINKER,Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
172586,L182292,u5005,m332,PINKER,Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
172587,L182291,u4991,m332,BUD,But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
172588,L182290,u5005,m332,PINKER,"It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away."
172589,L182289,u4991,m332,BUD,"If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?"
172590,L182288,u5005,m332,PINKER,Susan Lefferts.
172591,L182287,u4991,m332,BUD,Whose shoe?
172592,L182286,u5005,m332,PINKER,You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
172593,L182285,u4991,m332,BUD,Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
172594,L182284,u5005,m332,PINKER,What do you want to know?
172595,L182283,u4991,m332,BUD,I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
172596,L182282,u5005,m332,PINKER,"I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed."
172597,L182281,u4991,m332,BUD,I got a few Nite Owl questions.
172598,L182280,u5005,m332,PINKER,"Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?"
172599,L181805,u4992,m332,CHIEF,"All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes."
172600,L181804,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him."
172601,L181801,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective."
172602,L181800,u4992,m332,CHIEF,"Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33."
172603,L181798,u4992,m332,CHIEF,And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
172604,L181797,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right."
172605,L181796,u4992,m332,CHIEF,"I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire."
172606,L181792,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department."
172607,L181791,u4992,m332,CHIEF,"Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?"
172608,L182537,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Just show me where they are!
172609,L182536,u4993,m332,CLERK,I don't have time.  I have --

172613,L182532,u4993,m332,CLERK,Nothing.
172614,L182531,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Anything?
172615,L182276,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Until he gunned down six people.
172616,L182275,u4993,m332,CLERK,More or less.
172617,L182274,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Clean?
172618,L182273,u4993,m332,CLERK,"I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean."
172619,L182134,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
172620,L182133,u4994,m332,COATES,"Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me."
172621,L182132,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?"
172622,L182131,u4994,m332,COATES,I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
172623,L182130,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good."
172624,L182129,u4994,m332,COATES,Say what?
172625,L182128,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
172626,L182127,u4994,m332,COATES,I don't own no shotguns.

172632,L182121,u4994,m332,COATES,You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
172633,L182120,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?"
172634,L182117,u4994,m332,COATES,"Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business."
172635,L182116,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?"
172636,L182115,u4994,m332,COATES,Believed what?
172637,L182114,u4997,m332,EXLEY,That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
172638,L182113,u4994,m332,COATES,I never truck with no sissies!
172639,L182112,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --"
172640,L182111,u4994,m332,COATES,"Man, why do you keep asking me that?"
172641,L182110,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?"
172642,L182109,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Did one of the officers work you over a little?
172643,L182108,u4994,m332,COATES,Say what and so what.
172644,L182107,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?"
172645,L181886,u4995,m332,COHEN,Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
172646,L181885,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,Gone.  Not a trace.
172647,L181884,u4995,m332,COHEN,And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
172648,L181883,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,Nobody.  At least not yet.
172649,L181882,u4995,m332,COHEN,"I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?"
172650,L181881,u5008,m332,STOMPANATO,They shot him in his library.
172651,L181880,u4995,m332,COHEN,What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
172652,L182523,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --"
172653,L182522,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,And?
172654,L182521,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
172655,L182520,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships."
172656,L182519,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,And what?
172657,L182518,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,And?
172658,L182517,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o."
172659,L182514,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
172660,L182513,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
172661,L182512,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,What does that have to do --
172662,L182511,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,But you were business associates?
172663,L182510,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
172664,L182509,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
172665,L182508,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
172666,L182507,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
172667,L182506,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell."
172668,L182666,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
172669,L182665,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Something like that.
172670,L182664,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?"
172671,L182663,u4997,m332,EXLEY,<u>No</u>.
172672,L182659,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people."
172673,L182658,u4997,m332,EXLEY,And now you'll provide them.
172674,L182657,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides."
172675,L182656,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Why?
172676,L182655,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history."
172677,L182654,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
172678,L182653,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund."
172679,L182494,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
172680,L182493,u4997,m332,EXLEY,No... Where'd the tip come from?
172681,L182190,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?
172682,L182189,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
172683,L182188,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --"
172684,L182150,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"She may still be alive, whoever she is."
172685,L182149,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
172686,L182103,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"I'll break them, sir."
172687,L182102,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Ed, I want confessions."
172688,L181932,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Get on it.
172689,L181931,u4997,m332,EXLEY,We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
172690,L181930,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Why?
172691,L181927,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
172692,L181926,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Yes, I do, sir."
172693,L181925,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it."
172694,L181924,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Sir, I took the call.  It's my case."
172695,L181910,u4997,m332,EXLEY,His blood's always up.
172696,L181909,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
172697,L181808,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,So be it.
172698,L181807,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Yes, Dudley.  I am."
172699,L181806,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?"
172700,L181795,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time."
172701,L181794,u4997,m332,EXLEY,White's a mindless thug.
172702,L181793,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
172703,L181754,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
172704,L181753,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father."
172705,L181752,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau."
172706,L181751,u4997,m332,EXLEY,No.
172707,L181750,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
172708,L181749,u4997,m332,EXLEY,No.
172709,L181748,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
172710,L181747,u4997,m332,EXLEY,No.
172711,L181746,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund."
172712,L181745,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I... No.
172713,L181744,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Answer yes or no.
172714,L181743,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Dudley, we've been over this."
172715,L181742,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
172716,L181741,u4997,m332,EXLEY,You're wrong.
172717,L181739,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I was thinking Detective Bureau.
172718,L181738,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
172719,L181737,u4997,m332,EXLEY,The youngest applicant by eight years.
172720,L181736,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
172721,L182488,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Not even with Exley?
172722,L182487,u4999,m332,JACK,No.
172723,L182486,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?"
172724,L182485,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice."
172725,L182484,u4999,m332,JACK,It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
172726,L182483,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?"
172727,L182482,u4999,m332,JACK,Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
172728,L182481,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"What's this all about, lad?"
172729,L182480,u4999,m332,JACK,"Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it."
172730,L182479,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
172731,L182478,u4999,m332,JACK,"You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?"
172732,L182477,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
172733,L182476,u4999,m332,JACK,"Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important."
172734,L182475,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad."
172735,L182105,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
172736,L182104,u4999,m332,JACK,"You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?"
172737,L181817,u4999,m332,JACK,Okay.  I'll do it.
172738,L181816,u4996,m332,DUDLEY,"John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now."
172739,L182431,u4999,m332,JACK,"Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner."
172740,L182430,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
172741,L182429,u4999,m332,JACK,What are you going to do?
172742,L182409,u4999,m332,JACK,She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
172743,L182408,u4997,m332,EXLEY,What?
172744,L182407,u4999,m332,JACK,She is Lana Turner.
172745,L182395,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
172746,L182394,u4999,m332,JACK,High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
172747,L182393,u4997,m332,EXLEY,What's Fleur-de-Lis?
172748,L182392,u4999,m332,JACK,Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
172749,L182391,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
172750,L182390,u4999,m332,JACK,Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
172751,L182389,u4999,m332,JACK,Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
172752,L182388,u4997,m332,EXLEY,What's that for?
172753,L182370,u4997,m332,EXLEY,A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
172754,L182369,u4999,m332,JACK,"Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar."
172755,L182368,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I want to do it right.
172756,L182367,u4999,m332,JACK,"The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant."
172757,L182366,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
172758,L182365,u4999,m332,JACK,"I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one."
172759,L182363,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?"
172760,L182362,u4999,m332,JACK,So what's the point?
172761,L182361,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
172762,L182360,u4999,m332,JACK,"Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?"
172763,L182358,u4999,m332,JACK,"You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>."
172764,L182357,u4997,m332,EXLEY,It's a simple question.
172765,L182356,u4999,m332,JACK,What?
172766,L182355,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
172767,L182354,u4999,m332,JACK,"I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession."
172768,L182353,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Listen, I think I made a mistake, too."
172769,L182352,u4999,m332,JACK,Yeah.  My whole life.
172770,L182351,u4997,m332,EXLEY,You make a mistake?
172771,L182350,u4999,m332,JACK,"Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone."
172772,L182349,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?"
172773,L182348,u4999,m332,JACK,Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
172774,L182347,u4997,m332,EXLEY,It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
172775,L182346,u4999,m332,JACK,Even I'm not that crazy.
172776,L182345,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I want you to follow Bud White.
172777,L182344,u4999,m332,JACK,Damnit... <u>What</u>?
172778,L182343,u4999,m332,JACK,"Give me a minute, will ya?"
172779,L182342,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I need to speak to you.
172780,L182097,u4999,m332,JACK,Just don't shoot me.
172781,L182096,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Glasses.
172782,L182095,u4999,m332,JACK,What?
172783,L182094,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Damnit...
172784,L182085,u4999,m332,JACK,<u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
172785,L182084,u4997,m332,EXLEY,L.A.P.D.
172786,L181829,u4999,m332,JACK,I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
172787,L181828,u4997,m332,EXLEY,What about you?
172788,L181827,u4999,m332,JACK,"You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs."
172789,L181826,u4997,m332,EXLEY,You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
172790,L181825,u4999,m332,JACK,"Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?"
172791,L181824,u4997,m332,EXLEY,<u>Throwing me</u>?
172792,L181823,u4999,m332,JACK,I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
172793,L181822,u4997,m332,EXLEY,That's right.
172794,L181821,u4999,m332,JACK,You're the key witness?
172795,L181697,u5010,m332,YOUNG OFFICER,"Of his penis, sir?"
172796,L181696,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I get the idea.  You got a description?
172797,L181695,u5010,m332,YOUNG OFFICER,"With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir."
172798,L181694,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Decorated?
172799,L181693,u5010,m332,YOUNG OFFICER,"A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself."
172800,L181692,u4997,m332,EXLEY,What's on the call sheet?
172801,L182505,u5005,m332,PINKER,I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
172802,L182504,u4997,m332,EXLEY,We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
172803,L182329,u5005,m332,PINKER,"Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought."
172804,L182328,u4997,m332,EXLEY,What are you talking about?
172805,L182327,u5005,m332,PINKER,Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
172806,L182326,u4997,m332,EXLEY,The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
172807,L181929,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
172808,L181928,u5005,m332,PINKER,We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
172809,L182424,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,"Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen."
172810,L182423,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Not good enough.
172811,L182422,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,No.
172812,L182421,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
172813,L182420,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,Why do men and women usually see each other?
172814,L182419,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Why's she seeing Bud White?
172815,L182418,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,Lynn Bracken.
172816,L182417,u4997,m332,EXLEY,What's her name?
172817,L182416,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,"A vulgar term, but yes."
172818,L182415,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
172819,L182414,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,"For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect."
172820,L182413,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Bud White's been here?
172821,L182412,u5004,m332,PATCHETT,I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
172822,L182687,u5001,m332,LYNN,Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
172823,L182686,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
172824,L182681,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Where is he?
172825,L182680,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Right now, before I back down."
172826,L182679,u4997,m332,EXLEY,When?
172827,L182678,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is."
172828,L182677,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Where will you go?
172829,L182633,u5001,m332,LYNN,I know how he feels.
172830,L182632,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did."
172831,L182631,u5001,m332,LYNN,"I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who."
172832,L182630,u4997,m332,EXLEY,A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
172833,L182629,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?"
172834,L182628,u5001,m332,LYNN,If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
172835,L182474,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside."
172836,L182473,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"You, me and White, huh?"
172837,L182472,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself."
172838,L182471,u4997,m332,EXLEY,You're the first person to ever call me tough.
172839,L182470,u5001,m332,LYNN,You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
172840,L182469,u5001,m332,LYNN,Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
172841,L182468,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Why not?
172842,L182467,u5001,m332,LYNN,No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
172843,L182466,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Some reality.
172844,L182465,u5001,m332,LYNN,"I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality."
172845,L182464,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?"
172846,L182463,u5001,m332,LYNN,You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
172847,L182462,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for."
172848,L182461,u5001,m332,LYNN,Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
172849,L182460,u5001,m332,LYNN,I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
172850,L182459,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I'll take your word for it.
172851,L182458,u5001,m332,LYNN,I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
172852,L182457,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
172853,L182456,u5001,m332,LYNN,You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
172854,L182455,u4997,m332,EXLEY,How about White?
172855,L182454,u5001,m332,LYNN,The silver screen's loss is your gain.
172856,L182453,u4997,m332,EXLEY,You sound like you mean it.
172857,L182452,u5001,m332,LYNN,"Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best."
172858,L182451,u4997,m332,EXLEY,How was I?
172859,L182445,u5001,m332,LYNN,The way you've underestimated Bud White?
172860,L182444,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken."
172861,L182443,u5001,m332,LYNN,It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
172862,L182441,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Why?
172863,L182440,u5001,m332,LYNN,I'm curious about you.
172864,L182438,u5001,m332,LYNN,"He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?"
172865,L182437,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down."
172866,L182436,u5001,m332,LYNN,He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
172867,L182435,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Really?  What did White say?
172868,L182434,u5001,m332,LYNN,I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
172869,L182433,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley."
172870,L182620,u4997,m332,EXLEY,What's Dudley's scheme?
172871,L182619,u5000,m332,LOEW,Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
172872,L182611,u5000,m332,LOEW,"I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for."
172873,L182610,u4997,m332,EXLEY,The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
172874,L182609,u5000,m332,LOEW,Do you have any proof?
172875,L182608,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?"
172876,L182607,u5000,m332,LOEW,Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
172877,L182606,u4997,m332,EXLEY,None.  Call it a hunch.
172878,L182605,u5000,m332,LOEW,On what evidence?
172879,L182604,u4997,m332,EXLEY,I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
172880,L182603,u5000,m332,LOEW,It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
172881,L182338,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"I don't doubt it -- Oh, God."
172882,L182337,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,My daughter was a virgin!
172883,L182336,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
172884,L182335,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Under the house.
172885,L182334,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,A sweet man.
172886,L182333,u4997,m332,EXLEY,Officer White?
172887,L182332,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
172888,L182331,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions."
172889,L182330,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,Let my Susie rest in peace!
172890,L181961,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip.
172891,L181960,u4997,m332,EXLEY,"When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?"
172892,L181959,u5002,m332,MRS. LEFFERTS,"It seems like my Susan, but..."
172893,L182257,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
172894,L182256,u4999,m332,JACK,Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
172895,L182255,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera."
172896,L182254,u4999,m332,JACK,He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
172897,L182253,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
172898,L182252,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,What happened with the kid and Loew?
172899,L182251,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"What's wrong, Trash?"
172900,L182250,u4999,m332,JACK,Shut up!
172901,L182249,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
172902,L182248,u4999,m332,JACK,"Sid, cut the crap.  I --"
172903,L182247,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
172904,L182228,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo."
172905,L182227,u4999,m332,JACK,Around.
172906,L182226,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Where'd you hear that?
172907,L182225,u4999,m332,JACK,"Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?"
172908,L182204,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
172909,L182203,u4999,m332,JACK,And Reynolds?
172910,L182202,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
172911,L182201,u4999,m332,JACK,"Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke."
172912,L182200,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"You tight with the D.A., trash?"
172913,L182199,u4999,m332,JACK,"What's he doing here, Sid?"
172914,L182198,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
172915,L182196,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Down around my ankles.
172916,L182195,u4999,m332,JACK,"Sid, how are they hanging?"
172917,L182194,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"You're back, boychick."
172918,L181906,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled"
172919,L181905,u4999,m332,JACK,What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
172920,L181904,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Not a word.
172921,L181903,u4999,m332,JACK,"Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something."
172922,L181902,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Something good?
172923,L181901,u4999,m332,JACK,No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
172924,L181900,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy."
172925,L181899,u4999,m332,JACK,"Sid, it's Vincennes."
172926,L181898,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
172927,L181690,u4999,m332,JACK,"Yeah, it's subtle."
172928,L181689,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?"
172929,L181686,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,I like it!  I like it!
172930,L181685,u4999,m332,JACK,Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
172931,L181684,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree."
172932,L181683,u4999,m332,JACK,No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
172933,L181682,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Jack!  It's Christmas!
172934,L181681,u4999,m332,JACK,I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
172935,L181680,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?"
172936,L181679,u4999,m332,JACK,"You lost me, Sid.  Who?"
172937,L181678,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,"Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner."
172938,L181677,u4999,m332,JACK,Is she?
172939,L181676,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
172940,L181674,u4999,m332,JACK,"Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine."
172941,L181673,u4998,m332,HUDGEONS,Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
172942,L182341,u5003,m332,OPERATOR,"Please hold, Sergeant..."
172943,L182340,u4999,m332,JACK,Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
172944,L181769,u4999,m332,JACK,A bootleg...
172945,L181768,u5003,m332,OPERATOR,"No, Sergeant.  I checked twice."
172946,L181767,u4999,m332,JACK,I just called it.
172947,L181766,u5003,m332,OPERATOR,Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
172948,L181765,u4999,m332,JACK,This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
172949,L181764,u5003,m332,OPERATOR,Pacific Coast Bell.
172950,L182235,u5006,m332,REYNOLDS,Showbiz.
172951,L182234,u4999,m332,JACK,It'll be our secret.
172952,L182233,u5006,m332,REYNOLDS,And no one'll know about this?
172953,L182232,u4999,m332,JACK,"I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz."
172954,L182219,u4999,m332,JACK,Yeah.  Me neither.
172955,L182218,u5006,m332,REYNOLDS,"You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up."
172956,L182217,u4999,m332,JACK,Really?  How?
172957,L182216,u5006,m332,REYNOLDS,"Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too."
172958,L182215,u4999,m332,JACK,Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
172959,L182214,u5006,m332,REYNOLDS,"Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all."
172960,L182213,u4999,m332,JACK,Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
172961,L182212,u5006,m332,REYNOLDS,"Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?"
172962,L182211,u4999,m332,JACK,Something like that.
172963,L182210,u5006,m332,REYNOLDS,Was it a party?
172964,L182209,u4999,m332,JACK,Yeah.

173048,L183654,u5015,m333,BRILL,Shit.

173054,L183647,u5016,m333,DEAN,"We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?"
173055,L183646,u5016,m333,DEAN,"No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert."
173056,L183645,u5015,m333,BRILL,You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
173057,L183642,u5015,m333,BRILL,Who?

173060,L183639,u5016,m333,DEAN,Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
173061,L183638,u5015,m333,BRILL,How?
173062,L183637,u5016,m333,DEAN,What if we just fucked with 'em?
173063,L183636,u5015,m333,BRILL,What if <u>what</u>?
173064,L183635,u5016,m333,DEAN,What if--
173065,L183634,u5015,m333,BRILL,They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
173066,L183633,u5016,m333,DEAN,What if--
173067,L183632,u5015,m333,BRILL,"If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays."
173068,L183631,u5016,m333,DEAN,What if--
173069,L183630,u5015,m333,BRILL,"Nah, they'd shut down the pin number."
173070,L183629,u5016,m333,DEAN,Listen--
173071,L183628,u5015,m333,BRILL,What if we transmitted it over cellular?
173072,L183622,u5015,m333,BRILL,<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
173073,L183621,u5016,m333,DEAN,Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
173074,L183620,u5015,m333,BRILL,"The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves."
173075,L183619,u5016,m333,DEAN,What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
173076,L183618,u5015,m333,BRILL,"It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my ""give-me-my- money"" idea?"
173077,L183617,u5016,m333,DEAN,What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
173078,L183616,u5015,m333,BRILL,I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
173079,L183615,u5016,m333,DEAN,So what do we do now?
173080,L183614,u5015,m333,BRILL,Same thing?
173081,L183613,u5016,m333,DEAN,What about newspapers and magazines?
173082,L183612,u5015,m333,BRILL,"Listen to you, ""directly"". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years."
173083,L183593,u5016,m333,DEAN,We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
173084,L183592,u5015,m333,BRILL,Goddammit--
173085,L183591,u5016,m333,DEAN,No he won't.
173086,L183590,u5015,m333,BRILL,Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
173087,L183589,u5016,m333,DEAN,Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
173088,L183588,u5015,m333,BRILL,Drive.
173089,L183587,u5016,m333,DEAN,We're not gonna hurt you.

173092,L183584,u5015,m333,BRILL,These guys are incredibly persistent.
173093,L183583,u5015,m333,BRILL,"Yeah, I can see where that'd--"
173094,L183582,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?"
173095,L183581,u5015,m333,BRILL,Fuckin-A.
173096,L183580,u5016,m333,DEAN,That wasn't so hard.
173097,L183579,u5015,m333,BRILL,We lost 'em.
173098,L183578,u5016,m333,DEAN,Oh my God...
173099,L183577,u5015,m333,BRILL,Think we let out enough air?
173100,L183576,u5016,m333,DEAN,I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
173101,L183575,u5015,m333,BRILL,Those are Feds.
173102,L183574,u5016,m333,DEAN,You're driving.
173103,L183573,u5015,m333,BRILL,You sure?
173104,L183572,u5016,m333,DEAN,Gimme that.
173105,L183569,u5015,m333,BRILL,They shouldn't have come without calling first.
173106,L183568,u5016,m333,DEAN,What the fuck?!
173107,L183567,u5016,m333,DEAN,Why?
173108,L183566,u5015,m333,BRILL,Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
173109,L183563,u5016,m333,DEAN,"'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please."
173110,L183562,u5015,m333,BRILL,"In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building."
173111,L183561,u5016,m333,DEAN,<u>Here</u>?!
173112,L183560,u5015,m333,BRILL,Here?

173114,L183558,u5015,m333,BRILL,Them.
173115,L183557,u5016,m333,DEAN,Who?
173116,L183556,u5015,m333,BRILL,They're here.
173117,L183555,u5016,m333,DEAN,What's going on?
173118,L183554,u5015,m333,BRILL,"Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please."
173119,L183553,u5016,m333,DEAN,Jesus. Do you have proof?
173120,L183552,u5015,m333,BRILL,The NSA killed him.
173121,L183551,u5016,m333,DEAN,Yeah.
173122,L183550,u5015,m333,BRILL,Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
173123,L183549,u5015,m333,BRILL,Yeah.  Take a walk with me.
173124,L183548,u5016,m333,DEAN,It really is.  Did you find anything?
173125,L183547,u5015,m333,BRILL,That is one ugly sunrise.
173126,L183544,u5015,m333,BRILL,Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
173127,L183543,u5016,m333,DEAN,Looks like Detroit.
173128,L183542,u5015,m333,BRILL,What do you think?
173129,L183541,u5015,m333,BRILL,Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
173130,L183540,u5016,m333,DEAN,They come after you?
173131,L183539,u5015,m333,BRILL,It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
173132,L183538,u5016,m333,DEAN,Why'd you leave?
173133,L183537,u5015,m333,BRILL,That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
173134,L183536,u5016,m333,DEAN,Jesus.
173135,L183535,u5015,m333,BRILL,"Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like ""bomb"" or ""President"". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis."
173136,L183534,u5016,m333,DEAN,How'd you have the manpower to--
173137,L183533,u5015,m333,BRILL,"They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted."
173138,L183532,u5016,m333,DEAN,How'd you get around the tap orders?
173139,L183531,u5015,m333,BRILL,I intercepted phone calls.
173140,L183530,u5015,m333,BRILL,I was a traffic analyst.
173141,L183529,u5016,m333,DEAN,"You used to work for 'em, didn't you?"
173142,L183528,u5015,m333,BRILL,None of your business.
173143,L183527,u5016,m333,DEAN,How do you know so much?
173144,L183526,u5015,m333,BRILL,"The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be."
173145,L183522,u5015,m333,BRILL,"Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!"
173146,L183521,u5016,m333,DEAN,I didn't use my name.
173147,L183520,u5015,m333,BRILL,You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
173148,L183519,u5016,m333,DEAN,Sorry.
173149,L183518,u5015,m333,BRILL,I told you no calls.

173167,L183500,u5015,m333,BRILL,I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.

173185,L183350,u5015,m333,BRILL,They're spooks.
173186,L183349,u5016,m333,DEAN,Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
173187,L183348,u5015,m333,BRILL,"Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow."

173189,L183346,u5015,m333,BRILL,"If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye."
173190,L183345,u5016,m333,DEAN,Why are they after <u>me</u>?
173191,L183344,u5015,m333,BRILL,It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
173192,L183343,u5016,m333,DEAN,I don't know what that means.
173193,L183342,u5015,m333,BRILL,230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
173194,L183341,u5016,m333,DEAN,I don't know what that means.
173195,L183340,u5015,m333,BRILL,"Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz."

173229,L183701,u5015,m333,BRILL,"FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops."

173237,L183693,u5015,m333,BRILL,"Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff."

173344,L183470,u5043,m333,STACY,What is it?
173345,L183469,u5016,m333,DEAN,"...who root through...uh...presents, and..."
173346,L183468,u5016,m333,DEAN,You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
173347,L183467,u5043,m333,STACY,I was missing you.
173348,L183466,u5016,m333,DEAN,That was for Christmas.
173349,L183465,u5043,m333,STACY,The lingerie.
173350,L183464,u5016,m333,DEAN,You opened the thing?
173351,L183463,u5043,m333,STACY,I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
173352,L183462,u5016,m333,DEAN,That's okay.
173353,L183461,u5043,m333,STACY,I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
173354,L183460,u5016,m333,DEAN,Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
173355,L183459,u5043,m333,STACY,I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--

173357,L183457,u5043,m333,STACY,Good.
173358,L183456,u5016,m333,DEAN,Well...yeah.
173359,L183455,u5043,m333,STACY,Does that hurt?
173360,L183454,u5016,m333,DEAN,"I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.  Please."
173361,L183453,u5043,m333,STACY,What happened to your head?
173362,L183452,u5016,m333,DEAN,"I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay."
173363,L183451,u5043,m333,STACY,This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
173364,L183450,u5016,m333,DEAN,I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
173365,L183449,u5043,m333,STACY,Just reporters.
173366,L183448,u5016,m333,DEAN,Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
173367,L183447,u5043,m333,STACY,Yes.
173368,L183446,u5016,m333,DEAN,Is Eric in school?
173369,L183309,u5043,m333,STACY,My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
173370,L183308,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--"
173371,L183307,u5043,m333,STACY,This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
173372,L183306,u5016,m333,DEAN,It wasn't me.
173373,L183305,u5043,m333,STACY,I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
173374,L183304,u5016,m333,DEAN,I know.
173375,L183303,u5043,m333,STACY,I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
173376,L183302,u5016,m333,DEAN,"No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now."
173377,L183301,u5043,m333,STACY,"Was that doctored-up, too?"
173378,L183300,u5016,m333,DEAN,"I know, but listen--"
173379,L183299,u5043,m333,STACY,I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
173380,L183298,u5016,m333,DEAN,Stacy--
173381,L183297,u5043,m333,STACY,Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
173382,L183296,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Stacy, don't hang up."
173383,L183169,u5043,m333,STACY,Leave this house.
173384,L183168,u5016,m333,DEAN,Stacy--
173385,L183167,u5043,m333,STACY,"I think you should leave now, Robert."
173386,L183166,u5016,m333,DEAN,"It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up."
173387,L183165,u5043,m333,STACY,"Oh, please--"
173388,L183164,u5016,m333,DEAN,It's not real...  That's not me.
173389,L183163,u5043,m333,STACY,The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
173390,L183162,u5016,m333,DEAN,"I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks."
173391,L183161,u5043,m333,STACY,You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
173392,L183160,u5016,m333,DEAN,I see her for business.
173393,L183159,u5043,m333,STACY,"You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year."
173394,L183158,u5016,m333,DEAN,I know.
173395,L183157,u5043,m333,STACY,I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
173396,L183156,u5016,m333,DEAN,I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
173397,L183155,u5043,m333,STACY,You <u>swore</u>!
173398,L183154,u5016,m333,DEAN,Yeah...look--
173399,L183153,u5043,m333,STACY,"""At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."""
173400,L183152,u5016,m333,DEAN,I've seen it.
173401,L183151,u5043,m333,STACY,"""Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--"
173402,L183150,u5016,m333,DEAN,It's not true.
173403,L183149,u5043,m333,STACY,Robert--
173404,L183148,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--"
173405,L183147,u5043,m333,STACY,How could you let me find out like this?
173406,L183146,u5016,m333,DEAN,Stacy?
173407,L183089,u5016,m333,DEAN,"There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it."
173408,L183088,u5043,m333,STACY,He's got his priorities?
173409,L183087,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Well, you know--"
173410,L183086,u5043,m333,STACY,I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
173411,L182959,u5016,m333,DEAN,It's okay.
173412,L182958,u5043,m333,STACY,Sorry.

173415,L182955,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric."
173416,L182954,u5043,m333,STACY,"Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--"
173417,L182953,u5016,m333,DEAN,A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
173418,L182952,u5043,m333,STACY,Who did you work with to get the--
173419,L182951,u5016,m333,DEAN,What do you mean?
173420,L182950,u5043,m333,STACY,How'd you get the information on DePinto?
173421,L182949,u5016,m333,DEAN,Yeah.

173423,L182912,u5016,m333,DEAN,A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
173424,L182911,u5043,m333,STACY,What'd you buy at Harrison's?
173425,L182910,u5016,m333,DEAN,"The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up."
173426,L182909,u5043,m333,STACY,I'm sorry.
173427,L182908,u5016,m333,DEAN,"In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back."
173428,L182907,u5043,m333,STACY,What do you mean?
173429,L182906,u5016,m333,DEAN,I saw a man die.
173430,L182905,u5043,m333,STACY,What?
173431,L182904,u5016,m333,DEAN,Something bad happened tonight.
173432,L182903,u5043,m333,STACY,You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
173433,L182902,u5016,m333,DEAN,I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
173434,L182901,u5043,m333,STACY,You should take this seriously.
173435,L182900,u5016,m333,DEAN,Right.
173436,L182899,u5043,m333,STACY,We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
173437,L182898,u5016,m333,DEAN,Just for the criminals.
173438,L182897,u5043,m333,STACY,So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
173439,L182896,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Not a very good one, but--"
173440,L182895,u5043,m333,STACY,Bobby!
173441,L182892,u5043,m333,STACY,Listen to him.
173442,L182891,u5016,m333,DEAN,Uh-oh.
173443,L182890,u5043,m333,STACY,This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
173444,L182889,u5016,m333,DEAN,Hey.
173445,L183179,u5016,m333,DEAN,Don't count on it.

173450,L183173,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Here, you can use this."
173451,L183172,u5018,m333,DESK CLERK,Maybe it's not connected yet.
173452,L183171,u5016,m333,DEAN,It's a brand new card.
173453,L183170,u5018,m333,DESK CLERK,"I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined."
173454,L182765,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one."
173455,L182764,u5017,m333,DEPINTO,I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
173456,L182763,u5016,m333,DEAN,"That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--"
173457,L182762,u5017,m333,DEPINTO,You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
173458,L182761,u5016,m333,DEAN,"You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun."
173459,L182760,u5017,m333,DEPINTO,This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
173460,L182759,u5016,m333,DEAN,That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
173461,L182758,u5017,m333,DEPINTO,You don't know who the fuck--
173462,L182757,u5016,m333,DEAN,It's not?
173463,L182756,u5017,m333,DEPINTO,That ain't me.
173464,L182755,u5016,m333,DEAN,I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
173465,L182754,u5017,m333,DEPINTO,Why the hell would I--
173466,L182753,u5016,m333,DEAN,"I don't believe it is, no."
173467,L182752,u5017,m333,DEPINTO,Is this a fuckin' joke?
173468,L182751,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers."
173469,L182750,u5017,m333,DEPINTO,What can I do for you?
173470,L183197,u5016,m333,DEAN,"I'll see if I can, you know, work things out."
173471,L183196,u5038,m333,SAL,And then what?
173472,L183193,u5016,m333,DEAN,My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now.
173473,L183192,u5038,m333,SAL,Oh.
173474,L183191,u5016,m333,DEAN,"No, I meant I'm Presbyterian."
173475,L183190,u5038,m333,SAL,You didn't squeeze DePinto?
173476,L183189,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Actually, that's not true."
173477,L183186,u5016,m333,DEAN,I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
173478,L183185,u5038,m333,SAL,I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
173479,L183254,u5036,m333,RACHEL,"My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's."
173480,L183253,u5016,m333,DEAN,Any idea what he looks like?
173481,L183248,u5016,m333,DEAN,Yeah.
173482,L183247,u5036,m333,RACHEL,"You're a moron, you know that?"
173483,L183246,u5016,m333,DEAN,It's not me?
173484,L183245,u5036,m333,RACHEL,What makes you think it's you?
173485,L183244,u5016,m333,DEAN,I'm sorry about that.
173486,L183243,u5036,m333,RACHEL,"I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man."
173487,L183242,u5016,m333,DEAN,"What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?"
173488,L183241,u5036,m333,RACHEL,This conversation's over.
173489,L183240,u5016,m333,DEAN,I <u>did</u> care how.
173490,L183239,u5036,m333,RACHEL,"Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how."
173491,L183238,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--"
173492,L183237,u5036,m333,RACHEL,I've never met him?
173493,L183236,u5016,m333,DEAN,You have to.
173494,L183235,u5036,m333,RACHEL,I can't.
173495,L183234,u5016,m333,DEAN,Tell me about Brill.
173496,L183233,u5036,m333,RACHEL,How?
173497,L183232,u5016,m333,DEAN,I'm gonna fix it.
173498,L183231,u5036,m333,RACHEL,We're screwed.
173499,L183230,u5016,m333,DEAN,Rachel--
173500,L183229,u5036,m333,RACHEL,Bullshit.
173501,L183228,u5016,m333,DEAN,That's temporary.
173502,L183227,u5036,m333,RACHEL,"You don't work there anymore, Bobby."
173503,L183226,u5016,m333,DEAN,My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
173504,L183225,u5036,m333,RACHEL,For the last four years.
173505,L183224,u5016,m333,DEAN,You being audited?
173506,L183223,u5036,m333,RACHEL,The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
173507,L183222,u5016,m333,DEAN,I know.
173508,L183218,u5016,m333,DEAN,Will you hang on just a second.
173509,L183217,u5036,m333,RACHEL,I gotta go.
173510,L183216,u5016,m333,DEAN,Who's doing this?
173511,L183215,u5036,m333,RACHEL,It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
173512,L183214,u5016,m333,DEAN,You got a minute?
173513,L183213,u5036,m333,RACHEL,Good. You're just what I need right now.
173514,L183096,u5016,m333,DEAN,"All right, look--"
173515,L183095,u5036,m333,RACHEL,"There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!"
173516,L183094,u5016,m333,DEAN,Why?
173517,L183093,u5036,m333,RACHEL,I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
173518,L182749,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg."
173519,L182748,u5036,m333,RACHEL,Eat your fish.
173520,L182747,u5016,m333,DEAN,Thank you.
173521,L182746,u5036,m333,RACHEL,I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
173522,L182745,u5016,m333,DEAN,How can I be sure.
173523,L182744,u5036,m333,RACHEL,You're not.
173524,L182743,u5016,m333,DEAN,I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
173525,L182742,u5036,m333,RACHEL,He doesn't work that way.
173526,L182741,u5016,m333,DEAN,I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
173527,L182740,u5036,m333,RACHEL,Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
173528,L182739,u5016,m333,DEAN,Why would I--
173529,L182738,u5036,m333,RACHEL,Other than me.
173530,L182737,u5016,m333,DEAN,Other than Brill.
173531,L182736,u5036,m333,RACHEL,I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.

173604,L182803,u5016,m333,DEAN,I have to go lingerie shopping.
173605,L182802,u5042,m333,SILVERBERG,And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
173606,L182801,u5016,m333,DEAN,"God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening."

173609,L182712,u5016,m333,DEAN,Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
173610,L182711,u5027,m333,L.T.,Why would the Union--
173611,L182710,u5016,m333,DEAN,The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
173612,L182709,u5027,m333,L.T.,I don't under--
173613,L182708,u5016,m333,DEAN,That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
173614,L182707,u5027,m333,L.T.,"I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse."
173615,L182706,u5016,m333,DEAN,"L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans."
173616,L182705,u5027,m333,L.T.,"Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom."
173617,L182704,u5016,m333,DEAN,Good point.
173618,L182703,u5027,m333,L.T.,"Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer."
173619,L183145,u5025,m333,JENNY,"Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole."
173620,L183144,u5016,m333,DEAN,Why?
173621,L183143,u5025,m333,JENNY,She can't talk to you right now.

In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?"
173634,L183485,u5020,m333,ERIC,Who won the fight?
173635,L183484,u5016,m333,DEAN,No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
173636,L183483,u5020,m333,ERIC,Are you and mom getting a divorce?
173637,L183482,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon."

173703,L183078,u5016,m333,DEAN,I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?

173723,L182962,u5016,m333,DEAN,"They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo."
173724,L182859,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Yeah, what's going on?"
173725,L182858,u5045,m333,ZAVITZ,Are you still in Crystal City?

173727,L182856,u5045,m333,ZAVITZ,How can I reach you?
173728,L182855,u5016,m333,DEAN,Tell me about it.
173729,L182854,u5045,m333,ZAVITZ,I need help.
173730,L182853,u5016,m333,DEAN,"I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--"
173731,L182852,u5045,m333,ZAVITZ,Yeah.
173732,L182851,u5016,m333,DEAN,It's been a few years.
173733,L182850,u5045,m333,ZAVITZ,Bobby--
173734,L182849,u5016,m333,DEAN,"It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--"
173735,L183046,u5016,m333,DEAN,Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
173736,L183045,u5028,m333,LEVIN,You think there was a connection to--
173737,L183044,u5016,m333,DEAN,I don't know.
173738,L183043,u5028,m333,LEVIN,Was Zavitz in trouble?
173739,L183042,u5016,m333,DEAN,I honestly don't know.
173740,L183041,u5028,m333,LEVIN,What does that have to do with you?
173741,L183040,u5016,m333,DEAN,He got hit by a bus.
173742,L183039,u5028,m333,LEVIN,Yeah.
173743,L183038,u5016,m333,DEAN,You remember Daniel Zavitz?
173744,L183037,u5028,m333,LEVIN,No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
173745,L183036,u5016,m333,DEAN,The police?
173746,L183035,u5028,m333,LEVIN,Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
173747,L183202,u5022,m333,FRANKIE,"Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible."
173748,L183201,u5016,m333,DEAN,Why not?
173749,L183200,u5022,m333,FRANKIE,Yes. But we can't.
173750,L183199,u5016,m333,DEAN,You would?
173751,L183198,u5022,m333,FRANKIE,Well we'd sure like to help you.
173752,L183195,u5016,m333,DEAN,"Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who."
173753,L183194,u5022,m333,FRANKIE,What is it you want?
173754,L182945,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Get it.
173755,L182944,u5021,m333,FIEDLER,"Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag."
173756,L182943,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Then what's your goddam opinion?
173757,L182942,u5021,m333,FIEDLER,Yes sir.
173758,L182941,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,"I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?"
173759,L182940,u5021,m333,FIEDLER,"It's hard to say for certain, these things are--"
173760,L182939,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,What's your opinion?
173761,L182699,u5023,m333,HAMERSLEY,"We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill."
173762,L182698,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,"There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?"
173763,L182697,u5023,m333,HAMERSLEY,"You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?"
173764,L182696,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
173765,L182695,u5023,m333,HAMERSLEY,I said fuck you.
173766,L182694,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,What?
173767,L182693,u5023,m333,HAMERSLEY,Fuck you.
173768,L182692,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,"It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--"
173769,L182691,u5023,m333,HAMERSLEY,You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
173770,L182690,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,It means who's side are you on?
173771,L182689,u5023,m333,HAMERSLEY,What the hell does it mean?
173772,L182688,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,"""I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars"". Revelations II."
173773,L183778,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
173774,L183777,u5024,m333,HICKS,Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
173775,L183776,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,What's your ETA?
173776,L183775,u5024,m333,HICKS,"Not yet. He's near ""M"" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units."
173777,L183774,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Do you have visual?
173778,L183773,u5024,m333,HICKS,Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
173779,L183750,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,And if it wasn't?
173780,L183749,u5024,m333,HICKS,"We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now."
173781,L183748,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,What about the tape?
173782,L183747,u5024,m333,HICKS,Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
173783,L183746,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Explain that.
173784,L183745,u5024,m333,HICKS,We don't know.
173785,L183744,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,What about--
173786,L183610,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,"Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!"
173787,L183609,u5024,m333,HICKS,If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
173788,L183608,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,"Oh, let's assume that they have."
173789,L183607,u5024,m333,HICKS,If they've looked at the video.
173790,L183606,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,So they know everything.
173791,L183605,u5024,m333,HICKS,And they have the video. That's confirmed.
173792,L183604,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Dean's with Lyle.
173793,L183603,u5024,m333,HICKS,No sir.
173794,L183602,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,You're kidding me.
173795,L183601,u5024,m333,HICKS,Yes sir.
173796,L183600,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Lyle?!
173797,L183599,u5024,m333,HICKS,Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
173798,L183598,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,We believe?
173799,L183597,u5024,m333,HICKS,"We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill."
173800,L183389,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his <u>lap</u>. I want the tape and I want him. Now is--
173801,L183388,u5024,m333,HICKS,I just meant--
173802,L183387,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,"No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland."
173803,L183386,u5024,m333,HICKS,Sir--
173804,L183385,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
173805,L183384,u5024,m333,HICKS,He's clever. He had help.
173806,L183383,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
173807,L183316,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Help from whom?  Christ.
173808,L183315,u5024,m333,HICKS,He had help.
173809,L183314,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
173810,L183074,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
173811,L183073,u5024,m333,HICKS,It was in his bag. Now it's not.
173812,L183072,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Hiding something?
173813,L183071,u5024,m333,HICKS,He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
173814,L182947,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Get it.
173815,L182946,u5024,m333,HICKS,We'd have to--
173816,L182926,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him <u>now</u>.
173817,L182925,u5024,m333,HICKS,Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
173818,L182924,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Who?
173819,L182923,u5024,m333,HICKS,"He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact."
173820,L182922,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Am I to understand--
173821,L182921,u5024,m333,HICKS,There was a transfer.
173822,L182920,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,The originals?
173823,L182919,u5024,m333,HICKS,We found the originals.
173824,L182918,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,What about the tapes?
173825,L182917,u5024,m333,HICKS,He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
173826,L182916,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,What happened?
173827,L182815,u5030,m333,MAN'S VOICE,"The door was open, sir. I just need a signature."
173828,L182814,u5045,m333,ZAVITZ,How'd you get in the building?
173829,L182813,u5030,m333,MAN'S VOICE,For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
173830,L182812,u5045,m333,ZAVITZ,Federal Express?
173831,L182811,u5030,m333,MAN'S VOICE,Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
173832,L182810,u5045,m333,ZAVITZ,Yes?
173833,L183742,u5041,m333,SHAFFER,"I don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own asshole again, you're not gonna get any help from us. It's ending at your doorstep."
173834,L183741,u5031,m333,MARSHAL,It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
173835,L183736,u5041,m333,SHAFFER,He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
173836,L183735,u5031,m333,MARSHAL,You have any idea what kind of position this--
173837,L183734,u5041,m333,SHAFFER,This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
173838,L183733,u5031,m333,MARSHAL,The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
173839,L183732,u5041,m333,SHAFFER,"We're not stupid, Reynolds."
173840,L183399,u5044,m333,WAITER,Yes sir.
173841,L183398,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Now is that clear?
173842,L183397,u5044,m333,WAITER,Yes sir.
173843,L183396,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Then let's assume I don't.
173844,L183395,u5044,m333,WAITER,No.
173845,L183394,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
173846,L183393,u5044,m333,WAITER,I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
173847,L183392,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,No thank you.
173848,L183391,u5044,m333,WAITER,Puffed cheese?
173849,L183390,u5037,m333,REYNOLDS,Yes?
173850,L184716,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling."
173851,L184715,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Tell me about your garden.
173852,L184714,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
173853,L184713,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I know.
173854,L184712,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"I'm sorry, Katharine."
173855,L184711,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
173856,L184710,u5046,m334,ALMSY,And a good read.  Don't waste it.
173857,L184709,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
173858,L184708,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you."
173859,L184707,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you."
173860,L184706,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Oh dear.
173861,L184705,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Yes.  Absolutely.
173862,L184704,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Shall we be all right?
173863,L184703,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I'm just going to find things for the fire.
173864,L184702,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Don't leave me!
173865,L184701,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
173866,L184700,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,It's so cold.
173867,L184699,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
173868,L184698,u5046,m334,ALMSY,You're wearing the thimble.
173869,L184697,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
173870,L184696,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Don't talk.
173871,L184695,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
173872,L184694,u5046,m334,ALMSY,What?
173873,L184693,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Why did you hate me?
173874,L184692,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"I know, darling, I'm sorry."
173875,L184691,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,It hurts too much.
173876,L184690,u5046,m334,ALMSY,We've got to get you out of here.
173877,L184689,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
173878,L184687,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"A surprise, he said."
173879,L184686,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Why did he bring you?
173880,L184685,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I can't move.  I can't get out.
173881,L184684,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?"
173882,L184592,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
173883,L184591,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
173884,L184590,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,No.
173885,L184589,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Dance with me.
173886,L184588,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
173887,L184587,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?"
173888,L184586,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Don't do this.
173889,L184585,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
173890,L184584,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Would you let me pass?
173891,L184583,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?"
173892,L184582,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,What?
173893,L184581,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Why did you hold his collar?
173894,L184487,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,You will.  You will.
173895,L184486,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny."
173896,L184484,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Don't go over it again, please."
173897,L184483,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him."
173898,L184482,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not."
173899,L184481,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
173900,L184406,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
173901,L184405,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Shall we be all right?
173902,L184404,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
173903,L184403,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"That day, had you followed me to the market?"
173904,L184402,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing."
173905,L184398,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Yes.  A different wife.
173906,L184397,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
173907,L184396,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat."
173908,L184395,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
173909,L184394,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous."
173910,L184392,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"You bastard, I was believing you!"
173911,L184391,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
173912,L184390,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"It's a long song - Szerelem means loveand the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -"
173913,L184389,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,It's beautiful.  What's it about?
173914,L184388,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me."
173915,L184387,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Arabic?
173916,L184386,u5046,m334,ALMSY,It's a folk song.
173917,L184385,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,This is - what is this?
173918,L184320,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  Swoon.  I'll catch you.
173919,L184319,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"This is empty, just coming!"
173920,L184318,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I can still taste you.
173921,L184315,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
173922,L184314,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,No.
173923,L184313,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
173924,L184312,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,What?  No!
173925,L184311,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Say you're sick.
173926,L184271,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me."
173927,L184270,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,A lie.  What do you hate most?
173928,L184269,u5046,m334,ALMSY,What do you hate most?
173929,L184268,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
173930,L184267,u5046,m334,ALMSY,What else?
173931,L184266,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths."
173932,L184265,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
173933,L184264,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Now.
173934,L184263,u5046,m334,ALMSY,When were you least happy?
173935,L184262,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Now.
173936,L184261,u5046,m334,ALMSY,When were you most happy?
173937,L184260,u5046,m334,ALMSY,That makes it harder still.
173938,L184259,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes."
173939,L184258,u5046,m334,ALMSY,You don't sew at all!
173940,L184257,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,You sew very badly.
173941,L184256,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Good.
173942,L184255,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I'm impressed you can sew.
173943,L184253,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I believe you still have my book.
173944,L184252,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Don't.
173945,L184251,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted."
173946,L184250,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Will you please come in?
173947,L184249,u5046,m334,ALMSY,No.
173948,L184248,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Will you not come in?
173949,L184242,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"No, but I think I do."
173950,L184241,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Do they know them?
173951,L184239,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"No, the marriage isn't a fiction."
173952,L184238,u5046,m334,ALMSY,And the marriage - is that a fiction?
173953,L184237,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
173954,L184235,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
173955,L184234,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid."
173956,L184233,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?"
173957,L184232,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored."
173958,L184231,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Oh my God, the others!"
173959,L184230,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around."
173960,L184228,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised."
173961,L184227,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
173962,L184226,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake."
173963,L184224,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
173964,L184223,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Yes.  Absolutely.
173965,L184222,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Shall we be all right?
173966,L184221,u5046,m334,ALMSY,No.
173967,L184220,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"This is not very good, is it?"
173968,L184219,u5046,m334,ALMSY,In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
173969,L184218,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
173970,L184217,u5046,m334,ALMSY,See what's happening to them - the stars.
173971,L184216,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,What am I looking at?
173972,L184215,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Look over there.
173973,L184214,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"I'm quite all right, thank you."
173974,L184213,u5046,m334,ALMSY,You should come into the shelter.
173975,L184212,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would."
173976,L184211,u5046,m334,ALMSY,There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
173977,L184210,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I'd like you to have them.
173978,L184209,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"We took several photographs, there's no need."
173979,L184208,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I thought you might paste them into your book.
173980,L184207,u5046,m334,ALMSY,What's this?
173981,L184190,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Ask Al Auf. Almsy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
173982,L184189,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I do not.
173983,L184188,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,You sing.  All the time.
173984,L184187,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Pardon?
173985,L184186,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Actually, you sing."
173986,L184157,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Her or me?
173987,L184156,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
173988,L184155,u5046,m334,ALMSY,He said - be careful.
173989,L184154,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?"
173990,L184152,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich."
173991,L184151,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
173992,L184150,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear."
173993,L184149,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"What do you mean, poetry?"
173994,L184148,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs."
173995,L184081,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?"
173996,L184080,u5046,m334,ALMSY,As the wife of one of our party.
173997,L184079,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,You felt obliged to.
173998,L184078,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to."
173999,L184077,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"After the market, you followed me to the hotel."
174000,L184076,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Excuse me?
174001,L184075,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Why did you follow me yesterday?
174002,L184056,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Excuse me.
174003,L184055,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
174004,L184054,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?"
174005,L184053,u5046,m334,ALMSY,That insults them.
174006,L184052,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I don't care to bargain.
174007,L184051,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton."
174008,L184050,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I don't want to go back.
174009,L184049,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back."
174010,L184048,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Excuse me?
174011,L184047,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Which stall?
174012,L184046,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?"
174013,L184045,u5046,m334,ALMSY,They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
174014,L184044,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Hello!  Good morning.
174015,L184043,u5046,m334,ALMSY,How much did you pay?
174016,L183961,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?"
174017,L183960,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Daskylus
174018,L183957,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
174019,L183956,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it
174020,L183950,u5046,m334,ALMSY,What kind of fossils?
174021,L183949,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
174022,L183918,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car."
174023,L183917,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
174024,L183916,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Thank you.
174025,L184575,u5046,m334,ALMSY,And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials  - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  Isn't that right?
174026,L184574,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"Sorry, what's your point?"
174027,L184573,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Fhrer!  Il Duce.
174028,L184332,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"I haven't, no.  Sorry."
174029,L184331,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,It's Geoffrey under this.
174030,L184330,u5046,m334,ALMSY,What?
174031,L184329,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Have you seen Katharine?
174032,L184182,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
174033,L184181,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Very well.
174034,L184180,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself."
174035,L184179,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -"
174036,L184178,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
174037,L184177,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her."
174038,L184176,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Appropriate?
174039,L184175,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
174040,L184174,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,You too.  Good luck!
174041,L184173,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Safe journey.
174042,L184168,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing."
174043,L184167,u5046,m334,ALMSY,What kind of photographs?
174044,L183924,u5046,m334,ALMSY,There you have me.
174045,L183923,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
174046,L183920,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Still a car.
174047,L183919,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,A broken car?
174048,L184734,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!"
174049,L184733,u5059,m334,OFFICER,I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
174050,L184732,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!"
174051,L184731,u5059,m334,OFFICER,Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
174052,L184730,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
174053,L184729,u5059,m334,OFFICER,"Right.  And what's your name, sir?"
174054,L184728,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society."
174055,L184727,u5059,m334,OFFICER,If I could just see some identification.
174056,L184726,u5046,m334,ALMSY,What?
174057,L184725,u5059,m334,OFFICER,"Do you have your papers, sir?"
174058,L184724,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk."
174059,L184723,u5059,m334,OFFICER,I see.
174060,L184722,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
174061,L184721,u5059,m334,OFFICER,"Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?"
174062,L184720,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Could I trouble you for some water?
174063,L184719,u5059,m334,OFFICER,Good morning!
174064,L184663,u5046,m334,ALMSY,There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
174065,L184662,u5057,m334,MADOX,May God make safety your companion.
174066,L184661,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands."
174067,L184660,u5057,m334,MADOX,I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
174068,L184659,u5057,m334,MADOX,I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need ithard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
174069,L184658,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
174070,L184657,u5057,m334,MADOX,When's Clifton picking you up?
174071,L184656,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
174072,L184655,u5057,m334,MADOX,"We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that."
174073,L184654,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I told you so.
174074,L184653,u5057,m334,MADOX,"Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so."
174075,L184652,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Right.
174076,L184651,u5057,m334,MADOX,"Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still"
174077,L184580,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round."
174078,L184579,u5057,m334,MADOX,"Look, either shut up, or go home."
174079,L184570,u5057,m334,MADOX,"Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface."
174080,L184569,u5046,m334,ALMSY,I believe I'm rather late.
174081,L184471,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Own the desert.
174082,L184470,u5057,m334,MADOX,"What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa."
174083,L184469,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Why do they care about our maps?
174084,L184468,u5057,m334,MADOX,Don't be so bloody nave.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
174085,L184467,u5046,m334,ALMSY,What's the matter with you?
174086,L184466,u5057,m334,MADOX,"Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of."
174087,L184465,u5046,m334,ALMSY,In my room.
174088,L184464,u5057,m334,MADOX,And where are the Expedition Maps?
174089,L184462,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura."
174090,L184461,u5057,m334,MADOX,Which we've overflown twice.
174091,L184460,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility"
174092,L184459,u5057,m334,MADOX,And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
174093,L184201,u5057,m334,MADOX,Bermann!
174094,L184200,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly."
174095,L184199,u5057,m334,MADOX,I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
174096,L183982,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up."
174097,L183981,u5057,m334,MADOX,I was talking about the girl.
174098,L183980,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane."
174099,L183979,u5057,m334,MADOX,What did you do?
174100,L183978,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Her hands and feet were tied.
174101,L183977,u5057,m334,MADOX,You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
174102,L183976,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
174103,L183975,u5057,m334,MADOX,What did you think you were doing in his tent?
174104,L184740,u5050,m334,CORPORAL,"That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?"
174105,L184739,u5046,m334,ALMSY,Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
174106,L184738,u5050,m334,CORPORAL,"Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding."
174107,L184737,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying."
174108,L184736,u5050,m334,CORPORAL,Shut-up!
174109,L184735,u5046,m334,ALMSY,"Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!"
174110,L184006,u5047,m334,BOY,Thank you.
174111,L184005,u5051,m334,HANA,"Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips."
174112,L184004,u5047,m334,BOY,Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
174113,L184003,u5051,m334,HANA,"No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there."
174114,L184000,u5047,m334,BOY,You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
174115,L183999,u5051,m334,HANA,Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
174116,L183998,u5047,m334,BOY,Okay.
174117,L183997,u5051,m334,HANA,How are you?
174118,L184563,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
174119,L184562,u5058,m334,MLLER,Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
174120,L184555,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Don't cut me.  Come on.
174121,L184554,u5058,m334,MLLER,Or was it Toronto?
174122,L184553,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Don't cut me.
174123,L184552,u5058,m334,MLLER,"Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?"
174124,L184550,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble."
174125,L184549,u5058,m334,MLLER,Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
174126,L184547,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great."
174127,L184546,u5058,m334,MLLER,"We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse."
174128,L184545,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -"
174129,L184541,u5058,m334,MLLER,You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
174130,L184540,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
174131,L184539,u5058,m334,MLLER,It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
174132,L184538,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,I don't know.
174133,L184537,u5058,m334,MLLER,Is this you?
174134,L184536,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you."
174135,L184535,u5058,m334,MLLER,"Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937."
174136,L184534,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,No.
174137,L184533,u5058,m334,MLLER,David Caravaggio.
174138,L184808,u5051,m334,HANA,I can get in the back.
174139,L184807,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,She can take you as far as Florence.
174140,L184806,u5051,m334,HANA,Buon' giorno.
174141,L184774,u5051,m334,HANA,"What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody."
174142,L184773,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"Well, then ask him his name!"
174143,L184412,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
174144,L184411,u5051,m334,HANA,I think that's called looting.
174145,L184410,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,I liberated it.
174146,L184409,u5051,m334,HANA,Where did you find that?
174147,L184308,u5051,m334,HANA,Please don't creep around this house.
174148,L184307,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
174149,L184306,u5051,m334,HANA,I don't know what that means.
174150,L184305,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
174151,L184304,u5051,m334,HANA,What?  How could he have?  When?
174152,L184303,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,What if I told you he did this to me?
174153,L184302,u5051,m334,HANA,Ask him.
174154,L184301,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Who are his ghosts?
174155,L184300,u5051,m334,HANA,I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
174156,L184299,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is."
174157,L184298,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
174158,L184297,u5051,m334,HANA,Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
174159,L184296,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
174160,L184141,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that."
174161,L184140,u5051,m334,HANA,What do you do?  What are you doing here?
174162,L184139,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
174163,L184138,u5051,m334,HANA,"It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -"
174164,L184137,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
174165,L184136,u5051,m334,HANA,I could help you.  I could get you off that.
174166,L184135,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Rabbit hunting.
174167,L184134,u5051,m334,HANA,Where've you been?
174168,L184133,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Supper. Hana calls after him.
174169,L184035,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Fine.  I'm not looking.
174170,L184034,u5051,m334,HANA,"Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at."
174171,L184033,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep."
174172,L184032,u5051,m334,HANA,If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
174173,L184031,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,No.
174174,L184030,u5051,m334,HANA,So you can shoot a pistol?
174175,L184029,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that."
174176,L184028,u5051,m334,HANA,So was my Patient.
174177,L184027,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"Yeah, for a while."
174178,L184026,u5051,m334,HANA,You were in Africa?
174179,L184025,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?"
174180,L184023,u5051,m334,HANA,Bonjour.
174181,L184022,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour."
174182,L184021,u5051,m334,HANA,What do you want?
174183,L184020,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Are you Hana?
174184,L184019,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious."
174185,L184761,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"No, now I can't kill you."
174186,L184760,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
174187,L184759,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel."
174188,L184758,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly."
174189,L184757,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
174190,L184683,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
174191,L184682,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?"
174192,L184681,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Thousands of people did die, just different people."
174193,L184680,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
174194,L184679,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,The rest meant nothing to me.
174195,L184678,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,What did you say?
174196,L184677,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
174197,L184676,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing."
174198,L184675,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
174199,L184674,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression."
174200,L184673,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I see.
174201,L184672,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name."
174202,L184671,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Me?
174203,L184670,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you."
174204,L184669,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,We shall miss you.
174205,L184668,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?"
174206,L184667,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Hana tells me you're leaving.
174207,L184634,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,What?
174208,L184633,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
174209,L184629,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Very true!
174210,L184628,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -"
174211,L184627,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I've had a drink.  Fatal.
174212,L184626,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Have a drink.
174213,L184416,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Is there a song you don't know?
174214,L184415,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Top Hat.
174215,L184414,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,For?
174216,L184413,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Irving Berlin.
174217,L184408,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone."
174218,L184407,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Thought you'd never wake up!
174219,L184353,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
174220,L184352,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
174221,L184351,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Moose.
174222,L184350,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?"
174223,L184349,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face."
174224,L184348,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
174225,L184347,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
174226,L184346,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
174227,L184098,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
174228,L184097,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
174229,L184096,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,And you've forgotten yours.
174230,L184095,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name."
174231,L184094,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Are you planning to be the exception?
174232,L184093,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
174233,L184090,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
174234,L184089,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"Oh, all over."
174235,L184088,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
174236,L184087,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,"Thief, I think, is more accurate."
174237,L184086,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
174238,L184085,u5048,m334,CARAVAGGIO,Hello.
174239,L184345,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
174240,L184344,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,What?
174241,L184343,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
174242,L184342,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise."
174243,L184341,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war."
174244,L184340,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted."
174245,L184339,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home."
174246,L184338,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Aren't you?
174247,L184337,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Right.
174248,L184336,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
174249,L184335,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Lady H said she thought you might be -
174250,L184334,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I'm fine.  I got hot.
174251,L184333,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?"
174252,L184172,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
174253,L184171,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Oh.
174254,L184170,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft"
174255,L184169,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Why do you think?  About my staying?
174256,L184084,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"Well, she is!"
174257,L184083,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Darling, for goodness' sake!"
174258,L184082,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -"
174259,L184066,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,Oh really?
174260,L184065,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"The team is in mourning, darling."
174261,L183969,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Off with his head!
174262,L183968,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -"
174263,L184164,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
174264,L184163,u5057,m334,MADOX,Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
174265,L184162,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,To arm-twisting.
174266,L184161,u5057,m334,MADOX,"And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons."
174267,L184071,u5057,m334,MADOX,"Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here."
174268,L184070,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"Good heavens, are you married, Madox?"
174269,L184062,u5057,m334,MADOX,I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
174270,L184061,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,"Oh no, really.  She has her book."
174271,L184060,u5057,m334,MADOX,"Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace."
174272,L183943,u5057,m334,MADOX,This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
174273,L183942,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Apprentices.
174274,L183941,u5057,m334,MADOX,"I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England."
174275,L183913,u5057,m334,MADOX,We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almsy smiles and walks on towards the others.
174276,L183912,u5049,m334,CLIFTON,Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
174277,L183911,u5057,m334,MADOX,Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
174278,L184632,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
174279,L184631,u5051,m334,HANA,Never heard of it.
174280,L184630,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
174281,L184594,u5051,m334,HANA,Would you like me to?
174282,L184593,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
174283,L184490,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right."
174284,L184489,u5051,m334,HANA,You'd better be.
174285,L184488,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I'm still here.
174286,L184453,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,- to her cooking.
174287,L184452,u5051,m334,HANA,Hey! -
174288,L184451,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
174289,L184450,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I don't think it's indifference.
174290,L184449,u5051,m334,HANA,"I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me."
174291,L184448,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes."
174292,L184445,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
174293,L184444,u5051,m334,HANA,Arguing about books.
174294,L184420,u5051,m334,HANA,Kip's another one.
174295,L184419,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I've been told that before.
174296,L184418,u5051,m334,HANA,Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
174297,L184372,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"In that case, I suppose we can't charge."
174298,L184371,u5051,m334,HANA,They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
174299,L184370,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
174300,L184369,u5051,m334,HANA,With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
174301,L184368,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Why?  Is he staying?
174302,L184367,u5051,m334,HANA,I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
174303,L184366,u5051,m334,HANA,My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
174304,L184365,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Really?  That's sudden.
174305,L184364,u5051,m334,HANA,I'll probably marry him.
174306,L184363,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh."
174307,L184362,u5051,m334,HANA,"He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban."
174308,L184310,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,K is for Katharine.
174309,L184309,u5051,m334,HANA,"Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?"
174310,L184273,u5051,m334,HANA,"Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him."
174311,L184272,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry."
174312,L184146,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
174313,L184145,u5051,m334,HANA,He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
174314,L184144,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,That's a different dress.
174315,L184143,u5051,m334,HANA,"He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it."
174316,L184142,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
174317,L184124,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -"
174318,L184123,u5051,m334,HANA,This is Captain McGann.
174319,L184122,u5051,m334,HANA,Thank you.  Thank you.
174320,L184121,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Well then - yes.  Of course.
174321,L184120,u5051,m334,HANA,"No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get."
174322,L184119,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
174323,L184118,u5051,m334,HANA,He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
174324,L184117,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Your friend?
174325,L184116,u5051,m334,HANA,"Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?"
174326,L184115,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Yes?
174327,L184114,u5051,m334,HANA,Excuse me -
174328,L184042,u5051,m334,HANA,He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
174329,L184041,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
174330,L184040,u5051,m334,HANA,He needn't disturb you.
174331,L184039,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
174332,L184038,u5051,m334,HANA,He's Canadian.
174333,L184037,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Why?  Can he lay eggs?
174334,L184036,u5051,m334,HANA,There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
174335,L183995,u5051,m334,HANA,Because I'm a nurse.
174336,L183994,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
174337,L183993,u5051,m334,HANA,Are you crazy?
174338,L183992,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Could I have a cigarette?
174339,L183991,u5051,m334,HANA,Are you remembering more?
174340,L183990,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I can see my wife in that view.
174341,L183989,u5051,m334,HANA,No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
174342,L183988,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?"
174343,L183987,u5051,m334,HANA,I'm turning you.
174344,L183986,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils."
174345,L183985,u5051,m334,HANA,How?  How can you see anything?
174346,L183984,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I can already see.
174347,L183983,u5051,m334,HANA,"I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery."
174348,L183974,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Yes.  Dropping off.
174349,L183973,u5051,m334,HANA,Are you asleep?
174350,L183966,u5051,m334,HANA,"When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure"
174351,L183965,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please."
174352,L183964,u5051,m334,HANA,Candaulesyou're laughing at me.

174356,L183930,u5051,m334,HANA,Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
174357,L183929,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him."
174358,L183928,u5051,m334,HANA,"I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?"
174359,L183927,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
174360,L183926,u5051,m334,HANA,I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
174361,L183925,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
174362,L183886,u5051,m334,HANA,"Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!"
174363,L183885,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs."

174369,L183862,u5051,m334,HANA,No!
174370,L183861,u5053,m334,JAN,"You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk."
174371,L183860,u5051,m334,HANA,I'm not sewing anything else.
174372,L183859,u5053,m334,JAN,There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.

174377,L184787,u5051,m334,HANA,I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
174378,L184786,u5051,m334,HANA,"I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us."
174379,L184785,u5055,m334,KIP,It's what I've learned.
174380,L184784,u5051,m334,HANA,Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
174381,L184783,u5055,m334,KIP,"I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman."
174382,L184782,u5051,m334,HANA,Kip I -

174386,L184756,u5051,m334,HANA,Nya-nya-nya!
174387,L184755,u5055,m334,KIP,This is hot!
174388,L184754,u5055,m334,KIP,The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
174389,L184753,u5051,m334,HANA,"I should go to the house, get breakfast."
174390,L184752,u5055,m334,KIP,"When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away."
174391,L184751,u5055,m334,KIP,"That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot."
174392,L184750,u5051,m334,HANA,What are you up to?
174393,L184649,u5051,m334,HANA,You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
174394,L184648,u5055,m334,KIP,Then I'd think there must be a reason.
174395,L184647,u5051,m334,HANA,But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
174396,L184646,u5055,m334,KIP,I try not to expect you.
174397,L184645,u5051,m334,HANA,"If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?"
174398,L184644,u5051,m334,HANA,You loved him.
174399,L184643,u5055,m334,KIP,"I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about."
174400,L184625,u5055,m334,KIP,Yes.  Later.
174401,L184624,u5051,m334,HANA,Kip - come and dance with me
174402,L184608,u5055,m334,KIP,This is what I do.  I do this every day.
174403,L184607,u5051,m334,HANA,"Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man."
174404,L184515,u5055,m334,KIP,Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
174405,L184514,u5051,m334,HANA,Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
174406,L184513,u5055,m334,KIP,No. But he hands them over.
174407,L184512,u5051,m334,HANA,"Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers."
174408,L184511,u5055,m334,KIP,You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
174409,L184510,u5051,m334,HANA,I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
174410,L184509,u5055,m334,KIP,Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
174411,L184508,u5051,m334,HANA,I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
174412,L184507,u5055,m334,KIP,What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
174413,L184504,u5055,m334,KIP,I've done this.  I've had to do this.
174414,L184503,u5051,m334,HANA,Why would anyone do this?
174415,L184501,u5051,m334,HANA,I follow the wires.
174416,L184500,u5055,m334,KIP,You get Hardy.
174417,L184499,u5051,m334,HANA,So I follow the wires?
174418,L184498,u5055,m334,KIP,"There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over."
174419,L184497,u5051,m334,HANA,What do I do?
174420,L184496,u5055,m334,KIP,"The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them."
174421,L184495,u5051,m334,HANA,It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
174422,L184447,u5051,m334,HANA,I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
174423,L184446,u5055,m334,KIP,I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
174424,L184434,u5051,m334,HANA,"Yes, for your hair."
174425,L184433,u5055,m334,KIP,For my hair?
174426,L184432,u5055,m334,KIP,Thank you.
174427,L184431,u5051,m334,HANA,Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
174428,L184361,u5051,m334,HANA,I don't think so.
174429,L184360,u5055,m334,KIP,I've met you before.
174430,L184359,u5051,m334,HANA,"No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all."
174431,L184358,u5055,m334,KIP,Is something funny?
174432,L184357,u5051,m334,HANA,I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
174433,L184356,u5055,m334,KIP,The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
174434,L184355,u5051,m334,HANA,Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
174435,L184295,u5051,m334,HANA,Oh God.  Oh God.
174436,L184294,u5060,m334,OLIVER,No.  He's - no.
174437,L184293,u5051,m334,HANA,"He's gone, hasn't he?"
174438,L184288,u5051,m334,HANA,"Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver."
174439,L184287,u5060,m334,OLIVER,Third Canadian Fusiliers.
174440,L184284,u5060,m334,OLIVER,"He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?"
174441,L184283,u5051,m334,HANA,Why Picton?
174442,L183882,u5060,m334,OLIVER,If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
174443,L183881,u5051,m334,HANA,He can't even move.
174444,L183880,u5060,m334,OLIVER,And what if he really is a spy?
174445,L183879,u5051,m334,HANA,I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
174446,L183878,u5060,m334,OLIVER,"It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -"
174447,L183877,u5051,m334,HANA,When he dies I'll catch up.
174448,L183876,u5060,m334,OLIVER,It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
174449,L183875,u5051,m334,HANA,The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
174450,L184604,u5051,m334,HANA,"What if you couldn't find him?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning."
174451,L184603,u5052,m334,HARDY,Pardon me?
174452,L184602,u5051,m334,HANA,Does he have to go?
174453,L184601,u5052,m334,HARDY,"A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears."
174454,L184600,u5051,m334,HANA,I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
174455,L184599,u5052,m334,HARDY,Only we have to go to work.
174456,L184598,u5051,m334,HANA,He's sleeping.
174457,L184597,u5052,m334,HARDY,I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
174458,L184428,u5052,m334,HARDY,A toddler
174459,L184427,u5051,m334,HANA,You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
174460,L184426,u5052,m334,HARDY,I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
174461,L184425,u5051,m334,HANA,"Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please."
174462,L184424,u5052,m334,HARDY,"Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -"
174463,L184423,u5051,m334,HANA,"I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh"
174464,L184422,u5052,m334,HARDY,Hello miss.
174465,L184421,u5051,m334,HANA,Hello.
174466,L184132,u5061,m334,STUART,I'm feeling old.
174467,L184131,u5051,m334,HANA,I thought that was for when we were very very old?
174468,L184130,u5061,m334,STUART,I had a hotel room.
174469,L184129,u5051,m334,HANA,I was looking forward to this evening.
174470,L184128,u5061,m334,STUART,A bit of one.
174471,L184127,u5051,m334,HANA,You've got a mustache.
174472,L184018,u5061,m334,STUART,"We can do that when we're very, very old."
174473,L184017,u5051,m334,HANA,I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
174474,L184016,u5061,m334,STUART,"I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private."
174475,L184015,u5051,m334,HANA,Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
174476,L184014,u5061,m334,STUART,Whoa - give me a chance!
174477,L184618,u5055,m334,KIP,This is making me incredibly angry.
174478,L184617,u5052,m334,HARDY,Yessir.
174479,L184616,u5055,m334,KIP,Go away.
174480,L184615,u5052,m334,HARDY,"You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last."
174481,L184606,u5052,m334,HARDY,"I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him."
174482,L184605,u5055,m334,KIP,What's happening?  Am I needed?
174483,L183867,u5052,m334,HARDY,Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops.
174484,L183866,u5055,m334,KIP,Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
174485,L184206,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic."
174486,L184205,u5057,m334,MADOX,Certainly not.
174487,L184166,u5057,m334,MADOX,Why not?
174488,L184165,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Darling, Peter says I could stay"
174489,L184069,u5057,m334,MADOX,"A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist."
174490,L184068,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,How awful.  What will you do?
174491,L184067,u5057,m334,MADOX,I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
174492,L184064,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann."
174493,L184063,u5057,m334,MADOX,"Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women."
174494,L183959,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -"
174495,L183958,u5057,m334,MADOX,Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almsy looks uncomfortable.
174496,L184328,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almsy, who doesn't look up from his book."
174497,L184327,u5056,m334,LADY HAMPTON,I'll come with you.
174498,L184326,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
174499,L184325,u5056,m334,LADY HAMPTON,How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
174500,L184324,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,I don't think so.
174501,L184323,u5056,m334,LADY HAMPTON,"You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?"
174502,L184317,u5054,m334,KATHARINE,"Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma."
174503,L184316,u5056,m334,LADY HAMPTON,Katharine!
174504,L184776,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more."
174505,L184775,u5055,m334,KIP,They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
174506,L184767,u5055,m334,KIP,"What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this."
174507,L184766,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,What are you talking about?
174508,L184765,u5055,m334,KIP,"I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them."
174509,L184764,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Kip?
174510,L184457,u5055,m334,KIP,What's he saying?
174511,L184456,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,This is wonderful!
174512,L184443,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I."
174513,L184442,u5055,m334,KIP,"What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British."
174514,L184441,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
174515,L184440,u5055,m334,KIP,"It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives."
174516,L184439,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
174517,L184438,u5055,m334,KIP,Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
174518,L184111,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
174519,L184110,u5059,m334,OFFICER,Then you were married?
174520,L184109,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,Or my wife's.
174521,L184108,u5059,m334,OFFICER,This was your garden?
174522,L184107,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France."
174523,L184106,u5059,m334,OFFICER,How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
174524,L184105,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,No.
174525,L184104,u5059,m334,OFFICER,Why?  Are you German?
174526,L184103,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,"Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way."
174527,L184100,u5062,m334,THE PATIENT,No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
174528,L184099,u5059,m334,OFFICER,What about your rank or serial number?
174529,L185522,u5064,m335,GIN,"I'm going to get him, I promise you."
174530,L185521,u5063,m335,CRUZ,"Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you."
174531,L185520,u5064,m335,GIN,Too late now.
174532,L185519,u5063,m335,CRUZ,"Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out."
174533,L185518,u5064,m335,GIN,He's on to something bigger.
174534,L185517,u5063,m335,CRUZ,"In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?"
174535,L185516,u5064,m335,GIN,I'm in the middle.
174536,L185515,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Gin? Where the hell are you?
174537,L185281,u5064,m335,GIN,I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
174538,L185280,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Where are you at least?
174539,L185279,u5064,m335,GIN,"Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing."
174540,L185278,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Don't overestimate yourself.
174541,L185277,u5064,m335,GIN,"You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead."
174542,L185276,u5063,m335,CRUZ,This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
174543,L185275,u5064,m335,GIN,"I don't know, but close."
174544,L185274,u5063,m335,CRUZ,How close?
174545,L185273,u5064,m335,GIN,We're getting close.
174546,L185272,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
174547,L185271,u5064,m335,GIN,This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
174548,L185270,u5063,m335,CRUZ,"You don't call, you don't write."
174549,L184879,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Which you have in mind.
174550,L184878,u5064,m335,GIN,And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
174551,L184877,u5063,m335,CRUZ,That's doable.
174552,L184876,u5064,m335,GIN,I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
174553,L184875,u5063,m335,CRUZ,"How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?"
174554,L184874,u5064,m335,GIN,I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
174555,L184873,u5063,m335,CRUZ,With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
174556,L184872,u5064,m335,GIN,"It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it."
174557,L184871,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Why didn't I think of that?
174558,L184870,u5064,m335,GIN,We've got to catch him in the act.
174559,L184869,u5064,m335,GIN,Yeah. Me.
174560,L184868,u5063,m335,CRUZ,You got a better idea?
174561,L184867,u5064,m335,GIN,"They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?"
174562,L184858,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Exactly.
174563,L184857,u5064,m335,GIN,You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
174564,L184856,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
174565,L184855,u5064,m335,GIN,Mac's signature.
174566,L184849,u5064,m335,GIN,"Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them."
174567,L184848,u5063,m335,CRUZ,And the draft blew over the flowers.
174568,L184847,u5064,m335,GIN,Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
174569,L184846,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Meaning--
174570,L184845,u5064,m335,GIN,Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
174571,L184844,u5063,m335,CRUZ,You ordering chop suey again?
174572,L184843,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
174573,L184842,u5064,m335,GIN,"He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor."
174574,L184841,u5063,m335,CRUZ,That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
174575,L184840,u5064,m335,GIN,Bingo.
174576,L184839,u5063,m335,CRUZ,So he popped the pane?
174577,L184836,u5064,m335,GIN,Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
174578,L184835,u5063,m335,CRUZ,The windows don't open.
174579,L184834,u5064,m335,GIN,Through a window.
174580,L184833,u5063,m335,CRUZ,A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
174581,L184832,u5064,m335,GIN,I don't recall asking your permission.
174582,L184831,u5063,m335,CRUZ,I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
174583,L184830,u5064,m335,GIN,I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
174584,L184829,u5063,m335,CRUZ,You didn't answer the beeper either.
174585,L184828,u5064,m335,GIN,There are times when you don't answer the phone.
174586,L184827,u5063,m335,CRUZ,Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
174587,L185732,u5065,m335,MAC,You mean the seven billion.
174588,L185731,u5064,m335,GIN,You gave them the eight billion.
174589,L185730,u5065,m335,MAC,They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
174590,L185728,u5065,m335,MAC,That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
174591,L185727,u5064,m335,GIN,He looks familiar.
174592,L185725,u5065,m335,MAC,"Both sides of the street, I'm afraid."
174593,L185724,u5064,m335,GIN,--You're a cop.
174594,L185723,u5064,m335,GIN,My god--
174595,L185722,u5065,m335,MAC,You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
174596,L185721,u5064,m335,GIN,What about you?
174597,L185720,u5065,m335,MAC,It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
174598,L185719,u5064,m335,GIN,But--
174599,L185718,u5065,m335,MAC,"Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong."
174600,L185715,u5065,m335,MAC,"Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets."
174601,L185714,u5064,m335,GIN,What's wrong.
174602,L185705,u5064,m335,GIN,I'm not leaving without you.
174603,L185704,u5065,m335,MAC,Put this on!
174604,L185700,u5064,m335,GIN,"No, you can't."
174605,L185699,u5065,m335,MAC,I cannot get rid of you.
174606,L185698,u5065,m335,MAC,Get out of here!
174607,L185697,u5064,m335,GIN,Hang on.
174608,L185693,u5065,m335,MAC,Go!
174609,L185692,u5064,m335,GIN,No way.
174610,L185691,u5065,m335,MAC,Come on.
174611,L185687,u5065,m335,MAC,You can do it.
174612,L185686,u5064,m335,GIN,Jesus.
174613,L185679,u5065,m335,MAC,I sincerely hope not.
174614,L185678,u5064,m335,GIN,The door's the only way out!
174615,L185673,u5064,m335,GIN,"We can't help it, we...we've gotta..."
174616,L185672,u5065,m335,MAC,The disc is still in there.
174617,L185671,u5064,m335,GIN,"MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F..."
174618,L185668,u5064,m335,GIN,"We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!"
174619,L185667,u5065,m335,MAC,"Don't panic, now, there's no rush..."
174620,L185666,u5064,m335,GIN,FUCKING THING!!!
174621,L185665,u5065,m335,MAC,"Relax, don't jam it..."
174622,L185661,u5065,m335,MAC,"Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank."
174623,L185660,u5064,m335,GIN,"Jesus God, it's going through."
174624,L185656,u5065,m335,MAC,They'll each be positive the other guy did it.  I fear an ugly international incident.
174625,L185655,u5064,m335,GIN,China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
174626,L185654,u5065,m335,MAC,"And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about..."
174627,L185631,u5065,m335,MAC,"Brought us luck once, maybe it will again."
174628,L185630,u5064,m335,GIN,The sign of our partnership.
174629,L185624,u5064,m335,GIN,I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.
174630,L185623,u5065,m335,MAC,They drive so recklessly there.
174631,L185622,u5064,m335,GIN,I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
174632,L185621,u5065,m335,MAC,What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
174633,L185620,u5064,m335,GIN,Not for me.
174634,L185614,u5065,m335,MAC,"A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast."
174635,L185613,u5064,m335,GIN,That's because you grew up rich.
174636,L185612,u5065,m335,MAC,"Seen one billion, seen them all."
174637,L185611,u5064,m335,GIN,Four billion dollars.
174638,L185610,u5065,m335,MAC,"Oh, I don't care about the money."
174639,L185609,u5064,m335,GIN,So what are you going to do with your share?
174640,L185607,u5065,m335,MAC,I'm sorry.
174641,L185606,u5064,m335,GIN,Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
174642,L185605,u5065,m335,MAC,Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
174643,L185604,u5065,m335,MAC,Have really held you under?
174644,L185603,u5064,m335,GIN,But would you--would you--
174645,L185602,u5065,m335,MAC,But that's all behind us now.
174646,L185601,u5064,m335,GIN,It was wrong to deceive you.
174647,L185600,u5065,m335,MAC,That was a lifetime ago.
174648,L185598,u5065,m335,MAC,Call it a new tradition.
174649,L185597,u5064,m335,GIN,You have something in mind?
174650,L185596,u5065,m335,MAC,There is one more thing.
174651,L185595,u5064,m335,GIN,Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
174652,L185594,u5065,m335,MAC,You shouldn't have.
174653,L185592,u5064,m335,GIN,No. You'll see when we get inside.
174654,L185591,u5065,m335,MAC,No way to take another day or two?
174655,L185590,u5064,m335,GIN,Surgically attached.
174656,L185589,u5065,m335,MAC,Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
174657,L185588,u5065,m335,MAC,Packed.
174658,L185587,u5064,m335,GIN,Parachute.
174659,L185586,u5065,m335,MAC,Charged.
174660,L185585,u5064,m335,GIN,Pulse detectors.
174661,L185582,u5065,m335,MAC,Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
174662,L185581,u5064,m335,GIN,Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
174663,L185580,u5065,m335,MAC,Can't be too careful.
174664,L185579,u5064,m335,GIN,"Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour..."
174665,L185575,u5065,m335,MAC,Like a woman of mystery.
174666,L185574,u5064,m335,GIN,How do I look?
174667,L185564,u5064,m335,GIN,Feeling old?
174668,L185563,u5065,m335,MAC,"For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump."
174669,L185562,u5064,m335,GIN,"Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times."
174670,L185561,u5065,m335,MAC,"You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me."
174671,L185560,u5064,m335,GIN,"I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--"
174672,L185559,u5065,m335,MAC,There's always a surprise.
174673,L185558,u5064,m335,GIN,"There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises."
174674,L185557,u5065,m335,MAC,You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
174675,L185556,u5064,m335,GIN,That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
174676,L185555,u5065,m335,MAC,You can't be serious.
174677,L185554,u5064,m335,GIN,We're doing it tonight.
174678,L185553,u5065,m335,MAC,So how long till we do this?
174679,L185552,u5065,m335,MAC,You've thought of everything.
174680,L185551,u5064,m335,GIN,That's where the Mask comes in.
174681,L185550,u5065,m335,MAC,"Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me."
174682,L185549,u5064,m335,GIN,Got it.
174683,L185548,u5065,m335,MAC,It's no good without the argon gas.
174684,L185547,u5064,m335,GIN,The oscilloscope's already programmed.
174685,L185543,u5064,m335,GIN,"Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it."
174686,L185542,u5065,m335,MAC,A parting gift from the Empire.
174687,L185541,u5064,m335,GIN,Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
174688,L185540,u5065,m335,MAC,"But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer."
174689,L185539,u5064,m335,GIN,"Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it."
174690,L185538,u5065,m335,MAC,And the money goes--
174691,L185537,u5064,m335,GIN,"It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change."
174692,L185535,u5065,m335,MAC,Where the money is.
174693,L185534,u5064,m335,GIN,Peoples China Bank.
174694,L185532,u5064,m335,GIN,"Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them."
174695,L185531,u5065,m335,MAC,What's that?
174696,L185530,u5065,m335,MAC,Right. The eight billion.
174697,L185529,u5064,m335,GIN,The eight billion. From them to us.
174698,L185528,u5065,m335,MAC,Transfer.
174699,L185527,u5064,m335,GIN,Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
174700,L185526,u5064,m335,GIN,You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
174701,L185525,u5065,m335,MAC,Well...What are we doing?
174702,L185508,u5064,m335,GIN,"My job, my rules."
174703,L185507,u5065,m335,MAC,What about the rules?
174704,L185505,u5065,m335,MAC,I'd taken the Mask?
174705,L185504,u5064,m335,GIN,"Oh my god, I thought--"
174706,L185503,u5065,m335,MAC,Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
174707,L185502,u5064,m335,GIN,Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
174708,L185500,u5065,m335,MAC,"You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade."
174709,L185499,u5064,m335,GIN,The Mask. Where is it?
174710,L185446,u5064,m335,GIN,There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
174711,L185445,u5065,m335,MAC,"Idle hands, the devil's workshop."
174712,L185443,u5065,m335,MAC,"Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human."
174713,L185442,u5064,m335,GIN,"Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets."
174714,L185441,u5065,m335,MAC,"Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner."
174715,L185440,u5064,m335,GIN,I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
174716,L185439,u5065,m335,MAC,"Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it."
174717,L185438,u5064,m335,GIN,I'll need the Rembrandt now.
174718,L185437,u5064,m335,GIN,Everything.
174719,L185436,u5065,m335,MAC,You've got everything planned.
174720,L185435,u5064,m335,GIN,I always knew you'd do the job.
174721,L185434,u5065,m335,MAC,Hmmm...44 long.
174722,L185428,u5064,m335,GIN,Hold the record. Alone.
174723,L185427,u5065,m335,MAC,"Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?"
174724,L185426,u5065,m335,MAC,"It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress."
174725,L185425,u5064,m335,GIN,"My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--"
174726,L185424,u5065,m335,MAC,"No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--"
174727,L185423,u5064,m335,GIN,"Okay, 80-20--"
174728,L185422,u5065,m335,MAC,"If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split."
174729,L185417,u5065,m335,MAC,Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
174730,L185416,u5064,m335,GIN,I like banks.  That's where the money is.
174731,L185414,u5064,m335,GIN,You don't know the half of it.
174732,L185413,u5065,m335,MAC,We're living history here.
174733,L185404,u5065,m335,MAC,Get the hell in.
174734,L185403,u5064,m335,GIN,Your share.
174735,L185402,u5064,m335,GIN,A billion dollars.
174736,L185401,u5065,m335,MAC,What?
174737,L185399,u5065,m335,MAC,There is no big job.
174738,L185398,u5064,m335,GIN,The big job.
174739,L185397,u5065,m335,MAC,It's your mistake.
174740,L185396,u5064,m335,GIN,STOP! You're making...mistake.
174741,L185395,u5065,m335,MAC,What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
174742,L185394,u5064,m335,GIN,Yes. Yes.
174743,L185393,u5065,m335,MAC,"Okay, you're a thief."
174744,L185392,u5064,m335,GIN,"No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you."
174745,L185391,u5065,m335,MAC,You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
174746,L185388,u5064,m335,GIN,What?
174747,L185387,u5065,m335,MAC,Now's when you tell me who you really are.
174748,L185386,u5065,m335,MAC,The Mask.
174749,L185385,u5064,m335,GIN,We did it.
174750,L185378,u5064,m335,GIN,Shut up.
174751,L185377,u5065,m335,MAC,Careful...careful.
174752,L185374,u5064,m335,GIN,Duh.
174753,L185373,u5065,m335,MAC,Be careful not to break the laser beams.
174754,L185370,u5065,m335,MAC,Behind you.
174755,L185369,u5064,m335,GIN,They moved it.
174756,L185367,u5064,m335,GIN,Got it.
174757,L185366,u5065,m335,MAC,Can you see the other PIRs?
174758,L185346,u5064,m335,GIN,Ready.
174759,L185345,u5065,m335,MAC,Ready?
174760,L185344,u5065,m335,MAC,"Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance."
174761,L185343,u5064,m335,GIN,You can't be too careful.
174762,L185342,u5065,m335,MAC,These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
174763,L185341,u5064,m335,GIN,Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
174764,L185340,u5065,m335,MAC,You're not on the beat.
174765,L185339,u5064,m335,GIN,"One, two, three..."
174766,L185317,u5065,m335,MAC,"Let's mingle a little, shall we?"
174767,L185316,u5064,m335,GIN,It's a party.
174768,L185315,u5065,m335,MAC,We're working.
174769,L185311,u5064,m335,GIN,In eye of that painting.
174770,L185310,u5065,m335,MAC,"Popup, on floorboards. And--"
174771,L185309,u5064,m335,GIN,Bookshelf. Sensors--
174772,L185308,u5065,m335,MAC,Camera in the--
174773,L185303,u5065,m335,MAC,"He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody."
174774,L185302,u5064,m335,GIN,And--
174775,L185299,u5064,m335,GIN,Something like that.
174776,L185298,u5065,m335,MAC,So you had to be your own lifeline.
174777,L185297,u5064,m335,GIN,He wasn't.
174778,L185296,u5064,m335,GIN,My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
174779,L185295,u5065,m335,MAC,Aren't we all.
174780,L185294,u5064,m335,GIN,"I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay."
174781,L185293,u5065,m335,MAC,How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
174782,L185292,u5064,m335,GIN,Terrified. Still am.
174783,L185291,u5065,m335,MAC,You were afraid of heights?
174784,L185290,u5064,m335,GIN,"When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this."
174785,L185289,u5065,m335,MAC,You're nervous again.
174786,L185288,u5065,m335,MAC,To our...partnership.
174787,L185287,u5064,m335,GIN,To us. To the Mask.
174788,L185286,u5065,m335,MAC,Little celebration before we set off.
174789,L185285,u5064,m335,GIN,Aren't we early?
174790,L185284,u5064,m335,GIN,I've got something for you.
174791,L185283,u5065,m335,MAC,Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
174792,L185266,u5065,m335,MAC,"Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it."
174793,L185265,u5064,m335,GIN,Won't take any time.
174794,L185264,u5065,m335,MAC,It's not a village. There's nothing there.
174795,L185263,u5064,m335,GIN,"No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village."
174796,L185261,u5064,m335,GIN,Thank you.
174797,L185260,u5065,m335,MAC,Thank you.
174798,L185258,u5065,m335,MAC,Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
174799,L185257,u5064,m335,GIN,You bought this for me?
174800,L185256,u5064,m335,GIN,It's---beautiful.
174801,L185255,u5065,m335,MAC,I trust it's your size.
174802,L185254,u5065,m335,MAC,One more item--not on the check list.
174803,L185253,u5064,m335,GIN,That's it. We're ready.
174804,L185251,u5064,m335,GIN,Charged. Receiver?
174805,L185250,u5065,m335,MAC,Charged?
174806,L185249,u5064,m335,GIN,Got it.
174807,L185248,u5065,m335,MAC,The lipstick thermal camera?
174808,L185247,u5064,m335,GIN,A dozen times.
174809,L185246,u5065,m335,MAC,And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
174810,L185245,u5064,m335,GIN,Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
174811,L185244,u5065,m335,MAC,So how long to pop the floor?
174812,L185242,u5065,m335,MAC,Yes you did.
174813,L185241,u5064,m335,GIN,I didn't mean to get personal.
174814,L185238,u5065,m335,MAC,It was a long time ago.
174815,L185237,u5064,m335,GIN,"All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like."
174816,L185234,u5064,m335,GIN,Hmmm.
174817,L185233,u5065,m335,MAC,Our equipment has arrived.
174818,L185232,u5064,m335,GIN,Did I hear a car?
174819,L185189,u5065,m335,MAC,Try laps. Say a hundred.
174820,L185188,u5064,m335,GIN,Let's do it again.
174821,L185186,u5065,m335,MAC,We are...for the tools.
174822,L185185,u5064,m335,GIN,Why don't we take oxygen?
174823,L185183,u5064,m335,GIN,"Oh, I think you can do it. Probably."
174824,L185182,u5065,m335,MAC,So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
174825,L185181,u5064,m335,GIN,Let's just see how we do.
174826,L185180,u5065,m335,MAC,So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
174827,L185179,u5064,m335,GIN,Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
174828,L185178,u5065,m335,MAC,A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
174829,L185177,u5064,m335,GIN,We get the Mask I'll tell you.
174830,L185176,u5065,m335,MAC,On what? Another job?
174831,L185175,u5064,m335,GIN,No. It's a down payment.
174832,L185174,u5065,m335,MAC,"Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?"
174833,L185173,u5064,m335,GIN,This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
174834,L185172,u5065,m335,MAC,No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
174835,L185171,u5064,m335,GIN,I'll need that.
174836,L185168,u5065,m335,MAC,You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
174837,L185167,u5064,m335,GIN,Someone was expecting that.
174838,L185162,u5064,m335,GIN,It was perfect.
174839,L185161,u5065,m335,MAC,The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
174840,L185160,u5064,m335,GIN,You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
174841,L185159,u5065,m335,MAC,True enough.
174842,L185158,u5064,m335,GIN,I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
174843,L185157,u5065,m335,MAC,I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
174844,L185156,u5064,m335,GIN,That's because I wanted them to!
174845,L185155,u5065,m335,MAC,Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
174846,L185153,u5064,m335,GIN,"No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!"
174847,L185152,u5065,m335,MAC,"A lifelong problem, I'm afraid."
174848,L185151,u5064,m335,GIN,You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
174849,L185149,u5065,m335,MAC,This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
174850,L185148,u5064,m335,GIN,"Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one."
174851,L185147,u5065,m335,MAC,Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
174852,L185146,u5064,m335,GIN,You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
174853,L185145,u5065,m335,MAC,I go in alone.
174854,L185143,u5065,m335,MAC,"Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad."
174855,L185142,u5064,m335,GIN,We're doing this together. We're partners.
174856,L185141,u5065,m335,MAC,We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
174857,L185140,u5064,m335,GIN,We go underwater?
174858,L185139,u5065,m335,MAC,So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
174859,L185135,u5065,m335,MAC,That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
174860,L185134,u5064,m335,GIN,They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
174861,L185133,u5065,m335,MAC,Only a week?
174862,L185132,u5064,m335,GIN,In a week.
174863,L185131,u5065,m335,MAC,"Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?"
174864,L185130,u5064,m335,GIN,"As I recall, you've robbed it before."
174865,L185129,u5065,m335,MAC,I know it well.
174866,L185126,u5065,m335,MAC,It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
174867,L185125,u5064,m335,GIN,Nice spot.
174868,L185124,u5065,m335,MAC,Good morning.
174869,L185123,u5064,m335,GIN,And good morning.
174870,L185122,u5064,m335,GIN,<u>I'm</u> dressed.
174871,L185121,u5065,m335,MAC,You're late.
174872,L185117,u5065,m335,MAC,"My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure."
174873,L185116,u5064,m335,GIN,"Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?"
174874,L185110,u5065,m335,MAC,I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
174875,L185109,u5064,m335,GIN,Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
174876,L185108,u5065,m335,MAC,Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
174877,L185107,u5064,m335,GIN,I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
174878,L185106,u5065,m335,MAC,And--
174879,L185105,u5064,m335,GIN,I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
174880,L185104,u5065,m335,MAC,Lose something?
174881,L185100,u5065,m335,MAC,You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
174882,L185099,u5064,m335,GIN,What's my problem? You want a list?
174883,L185098,u5065,m335,MAC,What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
174884,L185097,u5064,m335,GIN,I don't believe this.
174885,L185095,u5065,m335,MAC,No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
174886,L185094,u5064,m335,GIN,That's entrapment.
174887,L185091,u5064,m335,GIN,Where's my bag?
174888,L185090,u5065,m335,MAC,I'm a thief. Sue me.
174889,L185089,u5064,m335,GIN,You stole my luggage? You--
174890,L185088,u5065,m335,MAC,Certainly not mine. Come on.
174891,L185087,u5064,m335,GIN,Those are my clothes.
174892,L185085,u5065,m335,MAC,I never carry...baggage.
174893,L185084,u5064,m335,GIN,What about your bags?
174894,L185078,u5065,m335,MAC,I'm not the one to ask...
174895,L185077,u5064,m335,GIN,"We're going to die, aren't we..."
174896,L185075,u5065,m335,MAC,We're only going one way.
174897,L185074,u5064,m335,GIN,It's one way.
174898,L185071,u5065,m335,MAC,Got it.
174899,L185070,u5064,m335,GIN,Motorcycle.
174900,L185059,u5064,m335,GIN,You what--?
174901,L185058,u5065,m335,MAC,Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
174902,L185057,u5064,m335,GIN,What the hell was that?
174903,L185050,u5065,m335,MAC,Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
174904,L185049,u5064,m335,GIN,What the hell do I do now?
174905,L185048,u5064,m335,GIN,Not funny.
174906,L185047,u5065,m335,MAC,"Damn, I knew I forgot something."
174907,L185046,u5064,m335,GIN,He says they turned the card down.
174908,L185044,u5065,m335,MAC,That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
174909,L185043,u5064,m335,GIN,A film case.
174910,L185042,u5065,m335,MAC,Look on the back. What do you see?
174911,L185041,u5064,m335,GIN,I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
174912,L185039,u5065,m335,MAC,Can you follow simple directions?
174913,L185038,u5064,m335,GIN,But--
174914,L185037,u5065,m335,MAC,Give him the card.
174915,L185036,u5064,m335,GIN,It's a fake.
174916,L185026,u5065,m335,MAC,I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
174917,L185025,u5064,m335,GIN,How much am I paying?
174918,L185024,u5065,m335,MAC,"It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card."
174919,L185023,u5064,m335,GIN,Fine. What do I do?
174920,L185022,u5065,m335,MAC,That's my girl.
174921,L185021,u5064,m335,GIN,It's a test.
174922,L185020,u5065,m335,MAC,"If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?"
174923,L185019,u5064,m335,GIN,I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
174924,L185018,u5065,m335,MAC,"Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney."
174925,L185017,u5064,m335,GIN,You want me to pick up a painting?
174926,L185016,u5064,m335,GIN,Not a word.
174927,L185015,u5065,m335,MAC,Very nice.
174928,L185014,u5065,m335,MAC,Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
174929,L185013,u5064,m335,GIN,Maybe I should drive this time.
174930,L185012,u5065,m335,MAC,Possibly.
174931,L185011,u5064,m335,GIN,We going somewhere?
174932,L185007,u5064,m335,GIN,"It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code."
174933,L185006,u5065,m335,MAC,Oh?
174934,L185005,u5064,m335,GIN,You can't.
174935,L185004,u5065,m335,MAC,"Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself."
174936,L185003,u5065,m335,MAC,Roki has a vivid imagination.
174937,L185002,u5064,m335,GIN,But Roki said--
174938,L185001,u5065,m335,MAC,"So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired."
174939,L185000,u5064,m335,GIN,I know.
174940,L184999,u5065,m335,MAC,It's not for sale.
174941,L184998,u5064,m335,GIN,I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
174942,L184997,u5065,m335,MAC,That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
174943,L184996,u5064,m335,GIN,Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
174944,L184995,u5064,m335,GIN,The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
174945,L184994,u5065,m335,MAC,The Empress Death Mask.
174946,L184992,u5064,m335,GIN,I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
174947,L184991,u5065,m335,MAC,For God's sake.
174948,L184990,u5065,m335,MAC,"Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth."
174949,L184989,u5064,m335,GIN,"Well, no...but..."
174950,L184988,u5065,m335,MAC,Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
174951,L184986,u5065,m335,MAC,Not interested.
174952,L184985,u5064,m335,GIN,"We were, we are, but this is perfect for you."
174953,L184984,u5065,m335,MAC,And I thought we were getting on so well.
174954,L184982,u5065,m335,MAC,"Oh, that's quite all right. No charge."
174955,L184981,u5064,m335,GIN,I've got something for you.
174956,L184976,u5065,m335,MAC,Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
174957,L184975,u5064,m335,GIN,No. Why would I be?
174958,L184974,u5065,m335,MAC,You're shaking. Are you nervous?
174959,L184973,u5065,m335,MAC,Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
174960,L184972,u5064,m335,GIN,You...you can't.
174961,L184971,u5065,m335,MAC,Do you mind?
174962,L184967,u5064,m335,GIN,So alive.
174963,L184966,u5065,m335,MAC,So what?
174964,L184965,u5064,m335,GIN,I didn't expect you to be so...
174965,L184963,u5065,m335,MAC,"Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously."
174966,L184962,u5064,m335,GIN,You're not taking me seriously.
174967,L184961,u5065,m335,MAC,I sincerely hope so.
174968,L184960,u5064,m335,GIN,I've got something...
174969,L184956,u5064,m335,GIN,Excuse me?
174970,L184955,u5065,m335,MAC,Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
174971,L184954,u5064,m335,GIN,Like I would have art in my suitcase.
174972,L184953,u5065,m335,MAC,"Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says."
174973,L184952,u5064,m335,GIN,Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
174974,L184948,u5065,m335,MAC,You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
174975,L184947,u5064,m335,GIN,I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
174976,L184945,u5064,m335,GIN,That's good. Terrific.
174977,L184944,u5065,m335,MAC,It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
174978,L184943,u5064,m335,GIN,Are you...okay?
174979,L184942,u5065,m335,MAC,You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
174980,L184941,u5064,m335,GIN,You disappeared.
174981,L184933,u5065,m335,MAC,It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
174982,L184932,u5064,m335,GIN,I'll call an ambulance.
174983,L184931,u5065,m335,MAC,Seems I am.
174984,L184924,u5065,m335,MAC,Meet me in front. Five minutes.
174985,L184923,u5064,m335,GIN,"Uh, yes."
174986,L184922,u5065,m335,MAC,You have a car?
174987,L184921,u5064,m335,GIN,"Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate..."
174988,L184920,u5065,m335,MAC,"Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you."
174989,L184919,u5064,m335,GIN,I have a proposal for you.
174990,L184918,u5065,m335,MAC,Then don't.
174991,L184917,u5064,m335,GIN,I don't want to waste your time.
174992,L184916,u5065,m335,MAC,"Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please."
174993,L184915,u5064,m335,GIN,"I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win."
174994,L184907,u5065,m335,MAC,"You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it."
174995,L184906,u5064,m335,GIN,Mr. MacDougal.
174996,L184895,u5065,m335,MAC,How about if you try disappearing.
174997,L184894,u5064,m335,GIN,How about if I try humility.
174998,L184892,u5064,m335,GIN,It's sold.
174999,L184891,u5065,m335,MAC,I can't?
175000,L184890,u5064,m335,GIN,No you can't.
175001,L184889,u5065,m335,MAC,"A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes."
175002,L184888,u5064,m335,GIN,Uh. I'm showing off.
175003,L184887,u5065,m335,MAC,Why are we speaking Chinese?
175004,L184886,u5065,m335,MAC,That is of no interest.
175005,L184885,u5064,m335,GIN,Who am I?
175006,L184884,u5065,m335,MAC,I have a question...
175007,L185454,u5064,m335,GIN,Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
175008,L185453,u5066,m335,QUI,"Gin, really."
175009,L185452,u5064,m335,GIN,"You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC."
175010,L185451,u5066,m335,QUI,Always in a rush.
175011,L185450,u5064,m335,GIN,We need to make the trade tomorrow.
175012,L185449,u5066,m335,QUI,"A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?"
175013,L185761,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Yeah. Probably not.
175014,L185760,u5065,m335,MAC,Probably not.
175015,L185759,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,See you.
175016,L185756,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill."
175017,L185755,u5065,m335,MAC,Yes it does.
175018,L185754,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"Takes a lot out of you, one like this."
175019,L185490,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her..."
175020,L185489,u5065,m335,MAC,"My friend, you always surprise me."
175021,L185485,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
175022,L185484,u5065,m335,MAC,I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
175023,L185483,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?"
175024,L185482,u5065,m335,MAC,"The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality."
175025,L185481,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,I figured that out.
175026,L185480,u5065,m335,MAC,"Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not."
175027,L185479,u5065,m335,MAC,You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
175028,L185478,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Thought you had to use some of these.
175029,L185477,u5065,m335,MAC,Call it an expression of trust.
175030,L185476,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,You're giving them to me?
175031,L185475,u5065,m335,MAC,"Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each."
175032,L185473,u5065,m335,MAC,"She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know."
175033,L185472,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
175034,L185471,u5065,m335,MAC,You'll just have to have faith.
175035,L185470,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"To yourself, that's where."
175036,L185469,u5065,m335,MAC,You know where my loyalties lie.
175037,L185468,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
175038,L185467,u5065,m335,MAC,It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
175039,L185466,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v."
175040,L185465,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
175041,L185464,u5065,m335,MAC,She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
175042,L185463,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"You're impressed with her, aren't you?"
175043,L185462,u5065,m335,MAC,She's calling the shots now.
175044,L185461,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,I'm waiting for the tell part.
175045,L185460,u5065,m335,MAC,This is just show and tell.
175046,L185459,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
175047,L185458,u5065,m335,MAC,"It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any."
175048,L185457,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
175049,L185456,u5065,m335,MAC,Check out my ball.
175050,L185455,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Tonight your league night?
175051,L185336,u5065,m335,MAC,I'm terribly sorry old man.
175052,L185335,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,You damn well thought wrong.
175053,L185334,u5065,m335,MAC,"Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter."
175054,L185332,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"You change partners, you change the rules."
175055,L185331,u5065,m335,MAC,"Suspicious, after all these years?"
175056,L185330,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,You better not be taking on a new partner.
175057,L185329,u5065,m335,MAC,We're supposed to.
175058,L185328,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,You two make quite a couple.
175059,L185327,u5065,m335,MAC,Because it pays off.
175060,L185326,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Remind me why.
175061,L185325,u5065,m335,MAC,"So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me."
175062,L185324,u5065,m335,MAC,But the second mouse gets the cheese.
175063,L185323,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,The early bird gets the damn worm.
175064,L185322,u5065,m335,MAC,It's too soon.
175065,L185321,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
175066,L185320,u5065,m335,MAC,You look like George Washington.
175067,L185319,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
175068,L185318,u5065,m335,MAC,"I said a masked ball, not a costume party."
175069,L185231,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,It better be worth it for me.
175070,L185230,u5065,m335,MAC,"Oh, it is."
175071,L185229,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,This better be worth 1t.
175072,L185228,u5065,m335,MAC,I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
175073,L185227,u5065,m335,MAC,Black of course.
175074,L185226,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper."
175075,L185225,u5065,m335,MAC,"I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga."
175076,L185224,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Because I never assume anything.
175077,L185223,u5065,m335,MAC,Right.
175078,L185220,u5065,m335,MAC,It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
175079,L185219,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?"
175080,L185218,u5065,m335,MAC,It's never big enough.
175081,L185217,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,This is big enough.
175082,L185216,u5065,m335,MAC,We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
175083,L185213,u5065,m335,MAC,You are a miracle worker.
175084,L185212,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
175085,L185211,u5065,m335,MAC,"If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient."
175086,L185210,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
175087,L185209,u5065,m335,MAC,We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
175088,L185208,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
175089,L185207,u5065,m335,MAC,The key to success is using the right tools.
175090,L185206,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
175091,L185205,u5065,m335,MAC,The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
175092,L185204,u5065,m335,MAC,And you do it so well.
175093,L185203,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,"Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries."
175094,L185202,u5065,m335,MAC,I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
175095,L185201,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
175096,L185200,u5065,m335,MAC,Tina was a wonderful woman.
175097,L185199,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,In the van.
175098,L185198,u5065,m335,MAC,Which is--
175099,L185197,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
175100,L185193,u5065,m335,MAC,Next time I'll use valet parking.
175101,L185192,u5067,m335,THIBADEAUX,I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
175102,L190161,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you."
175103,L190160,u5068,m336,ANNA,"Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad."
175104,L189773,u5068,m336,ANNA,Don't use language with me --
175105,L189772,u5076,m336,ERIN,What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
175106,L189771,u5068,m336,ANNA,Where've you been?
175107,L189615,u5068,m336,ANNA,"Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you."
175108,L189614,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that."
175109,L189565,u5068,m336,ANNA,"That's a joke, right?"
175110,L189564,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic."
175111,L189563,u5068,m336,ANNA,"... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --"
175112,L189921,u5069,m336,BAUM,"Hey, excellent.  Thanks."
175113,L189920,u5074,m336,ED,"Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport."
175114,L189912,u5074,m336,ED,Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
175115,L189911,u5069,m336,BAUM,"Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation."
175116,L189909,u5069,m336,BAUM,"250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer."
175117,L189908,u5074,m336,ED,Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
175118,L189907,u5069,m336,BAUM,"A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair."
175119,L189904,u5074,m336,ED,"You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions."
175120,L189903,u5069,m336,BAUM,"I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault."
175121,L189902,u5074,m336,ED,"What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors."
175122,L189901,u5069,m336,BAUM,"In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price."
175123,L189900,u5074,m336,ED,"250,000?"
175124,L189875,u5074,m336,ED,All of them.
175125,L189874,u5070,m336,BRENDA,All of 'em?
175126,L189873,u5074,m336,ED,"Fax these to this number, okay?"
175127,L189547,u5070,m336,BRENDA,Who?
175128,L189546,u5074,m336,ED,What's she doing here?
175129,L189545,u5070,m336,BRENDA,Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
175130,L189544,u5074,m336,ED,I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
175131,L189543,u5070,m336,BRENDA,It's those files you asked for.
175132,L189542,u5074,m336,ED,What the hell is this doing here?
175133,L189481,u5070,m336,BRENDA,Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
175134,L189480,u5074,m336,ED,"You shouldn't judge, Brenda."
175135,L189479,u5070,m336,BRENDA,"Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?"
175136,L189478,u5074,m336,ED,Whoa.  Remind me.
175137,L189477,u5070,m336,BRENDA,"He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there."
175138,L189476,u5074,m336,ED,Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
175139,L189475,u5070,m336,BRENDA,Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
175140,L189474,u5074,m336,ED,What do you think?  What's this?
175141,L189473,u5070,m336,BRENDA,His dry cleaners.  You want him?
175142,L189472,u5074,m336,ED,"Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?"
175143,L189471,u5070,m336,BRENDA,Tony Marvin.
175144,L189506,u5076,m336,ERIN,That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
175145,L189505,u5071,m336,DEFENDING LAWYER,An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
175146,L189504,u5076,m336,ERIN,"He came tearing around the corner, out of control --"
175147,L189503,u5071,m336,DEFENDING LAWYER,So you say.
175148,L189502,u5076,m336,ERIN,What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
175149,L189500,u5076,m336,ERIN,What's your point?
175150,L189499,u5071,m336,DEFENDING LAWYER,So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
175151,L189496,u5076,m336,ERIN,Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
175152,L189495,u5071,m336,DEFENDING LAWYER,There's more than one?
175153,L189494,u5076,m336,ERIN,Which one?
175154,L189493,u5071,m336,DEFENDING LAWYER,Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
175155,L190352,u5078,m336,GEORGE,... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?
175156,L190351,u5072,m336,DOCTOR,"Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ..."
175157,L190350,u5078,m336,GEORGE,How does someone get meningitis?
175158,L190349,u5072,m336,DOCTOR,"She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now."
175159,L190348,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Jesus.
175160,L190347,u5072,m336,DOCTOR,It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
175161,L190346,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
175162,L190509,u5073,m336,DONNA,Oh my God.  Oh my God.
175163,L190508,u5076,m336,ERIN,Yup.
175164,L190507,u5073,m336,DONNA,And get someone to help around the house.
175165,L190506,u5076,m336,ERIN,Any school you want.
175166,L190505,u5073,m336,DONNA,I can put them in a good school.
175167,L190504,u5076,m336,ERIN,"It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough."
175168,L190503,u5073,m336,DONNA,I don't even know how much money that is.
175169,L190502,u5076,m336,ERIN,Five million dollars.
175170,L190501,u5073,m336,DONNA,Five million dollars?
175171,L190500,u5076,m336,ERIN,And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
175172,L190499,u5073,m336,DONNA,"Oh, my God."
175173,L190497,u5076,m336,ERIN,Both.
175174,L190496,u5073,m336,DONNA,"A number for the whole group, or for us?"
175175,L190495,u5076,m336,ERIN,The judge came up with a number.
175176,L190494,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop."
175177,L190493,u5073,m336,DONNA,It's a good day.  I feel good.
175178,L190430,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ..."
175179,L190429,u5073,m336,DONNA,For what?
175180,L190428,u5076,m336,ERIN,"You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?"
175181,L190146,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire."
175182,L190145,u5073,m336,DONNA,"Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?"
175183,L189883,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?"
175184,L189882,u5073,m336,DONNA,"No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other."
175185,L189881,u5076,m336,ERIN,I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
175186,L189880,u5073,m336,DONNA,"Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine."
175187,L189879,u5076,m336,ERIN,Yeah.
175188,L189878,u5073,m336,DONNA,"And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?"
175189,L189877,u5076,m336,ERIN,It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
175190,L189876,u5073,m336,DONNA,An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
175191,L189712,u5073,m336,DONNA,"Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die."
175192,L189711,u5076,m336,ERIN,Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
175193,L189709,u5073,m336,DONNA,"I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other."
175194,L189708,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --"
175195,L189707,u5073,m336,DONNA,It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
175196,L189706,u5076,m336,ERIN,What's chromium?
175197,L189704,u5073,m336,DONNA,"The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off."
175198,L189703,u5076,m336,ERIN,The what?
175199,L189702,u5073,m336,DONNA,Cause of the chromium.
175200,L189701,u5076,m336,ERIN,Wow.  Why would they do that?
175201,L189700,u5073,m336,DONNA,"You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill."
175202,L189699,u5076,m336,ERIN,They did?
175203,L189698,u5073,m336,DONNA,"Well, they paid for the doctor's visit."
175204,L189697,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place."
175205,L189696,u5073,m336,DONNA,"Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place."
175206,L189695,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?"
175207,L189694,u5073,m336,DONNA,"So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point."
175208,L189693,u5076,m336,ERIN,I'll say.  Holy moley.
175209,L189692,u5073,m336,DONNA,"Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you."
175210,L189691,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that."
175211,L189690,u5073,m336,DONNA,"I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --"
175212,L189689,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --"
175213,L189688,u5073,m336,DONNA,"Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have."
175214,L189687,u5076,m336,ERIN,Right.
175215,L189686,u5073,m336,DONNA,"Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over."
175216,L189685,u5076,m336,ERIN,Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
175217,L189684,u5073,m336,DONNA,"I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ..."
175218,L189683,u5073,m336,DONNA,"Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it."
175219,L189682,u5076,m336,ERIN,This is a real nice place you got here.
175220,L189681,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?"
175221,L189680,u5073,m336,DONNA,You're a lawyer?
175222,L189679,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?"
175223,L189678,u5073,m336,DONNA,Yes?
175224,L189677,u5076,m336,ERIN,Hi.  Donna Irving?
175225,L190527,u5074,m336,ED,The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
175226,L190526,u5076,m336,ERIN,Two million dollars?
175227,L190525,u5074,m336,ED,Take it.
175228,L190524,u5076,m336,ERIN,What is that?
175229,L190523,u5074,m336,ED,"Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ..."
175230,L190522,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Ed, I swear, I'm not --"
175231,L190521,u5074,m336,ED,"""I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."""
175232,L190520,u5076,m336,ERIN,I wasn't gonna --
175233,L190519,u5074,m336,ED,"The extortion, the threats ..."
175234,L190518,u5076,m336,ERIN,Here what comes?
175235,L190517,u5074,m336,ED,"Oh, okay.  Here it comes."
175236,L190516,u5076,m336,ERIN,Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
175237,L190515,u5074,m336,ED,You see your office?
175238,L190514,u5076,m336,ERIN,Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
175239,L190491,u5074,m336,ED,"Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance."
175240,L190490,u5076,m336,ERIN,How do you know that?
175241,L190489,u5074,m336,ED,But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
175242,L190488,u5074,m336,ED,"The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history."
175243,L190487,u5076,m336,ERIN,Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
175244,L190486,u5074,m336,ED,I did.  Both.
175245,L190485,u5076,m336,ERIN,Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
175246,L190484,u5074,m336,ED,I was wrong.
175247,L190483,u5076,m336,ERIN,Say you were wrong.
175248,L190482,u5074,m336,ED,I don't know what to say.
175249,L190477,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too."
175250,L190476,u5074,m336,ED,Ho - ly - shit.
175251,L190474,u5076,m336,ERIN,"You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you."
175252,L190473,u5074,m336,ED,Erin?  What are you --
175253,L190472,u5076,m336,ERIN,Morning!
175254,L190385,u5076,m336,ERIN,"No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter is?  He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing."
175255,L190384,u5074,m336,ED,Erin --
175256,L190383,u5076,m336,ERIN,Fuck Kurt.
175257,L190382,u5074,m336,ED,Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
175258,L190381,u5076,m336,ERIN,Why not?
175259,L190380,u5074,m336,ED,This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
175260,L190379,u5076,m336,ERIN,The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
175261,L190378,u5074,m336,ED,You're not gonna be there.
175262,L190377,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --"
175263,L190376,u5074,m336,ED,"Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse."
175264,L190375,u5076,m336,ERIN,When?  Where?
175265,L190374,u5074,m336,ED,"<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --"
175266,L190373,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --"
175267,L190372,u5074,m336,ED,"Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --"
175268,L190371,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?"
175269,L190370,u5074,m336,ED,"Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal."
175270,L190369,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Wait, what do you mean, ten years?"
175271,L190368,u5074,m336,ED,"Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --"
175272,L190367,u5076,m336,ERIN,So why would PG&E offer it?
175273,L190366,u5074,m336,ED,"With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money."
175274,L190365,u5076,m336,ERIN,And if you had to guess ...
175275,L190364,u5074,m336,ED,Uh-huh.
175276,L190363,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?"
175277,L190362,u5076,m336,ERIN,I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
175278,L190361,u5074,m336,ED,"I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin."
175279,L190360,u5076,m336,ERIN,"If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy."

175284,L190328,u5076,m336,ERIN,How dare you take that away from me.
175285,L190327,u5076,m336,ERIN,"<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is."

175288,L190324,u5074,m336,ED,You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
175289,L190323,u5076,m336,ERIN,"And, what, I'm not serious?"

175299,L190290,u5076,m336,ERIN,Not in my world.
175300,L190289,u5074,m336,ED,Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!

175308,L190259,u5074,m336,ED,It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
175309,L190258,u5076,m336,ERIN,What's a demur?
175310,L190249,u5074,m336,ED,Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

175312,L190244,u5074,m336,ED,"It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars."
175313,L190243,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money."
175314,L190242,u5074,m336,ED,"Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ..."
175315,L190241,u5076,m336,ERIN,Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
175316,L190240,u5074,m336,ED,And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
175317,L190239,u5076,m336,ERIN,... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
175318,L190238,u5074,m336,ED,I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
175319,L190237,u5076,m336,ERIN,So what are you thinking?
175320,L190236,u5074,m336,ED,It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
175321,L190235,u5076,m336,ERIN,Whoa.  No shit.
175322,L190234,u5074,m336,ED,"Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it."
175323,L190233,u5076,m336,ERIN,What kind of things come up?
175324,L190222,u5076,m336,ERIN,"You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake."
175325,L190221,u5074,m336,ED,I'll see what I can do.
175326,L190220,u5076,m336,ERIN,I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.

175328,L190218,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?"
175329,L190217,u5074,m336,ED,"Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --"

175338,L190174,u5074,m336,ED,He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?

175340,L190172,u5074,m336,ED,What kind of truck?
175341,L190170,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer."
175342,L190169,u5074,m336,ED,What?  Who?
175343,L190168,u5076,m336,ERIN,Someone's following me.

175348,L190153,u5074,m336,ED,They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
175349,L190152,u5076,m336,ERIN,Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
175350,L190150,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Yeah, I heard that one before."
175351,L190149,u5074,m336,ED,"From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously."
175352,L190148,u5076,m336,ERIN,"If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off."
175353,L190119,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too."

175359,L190113,u5074,m336,ED,I like this case.
175360,L190112,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right."
175361,L190111,u5074,m336,ED,"Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is."
175362,L190110,u5074,m336,ED,Show me the document that proves that.
175363,L190109,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Oh, they knew.  They had to know."

175365,L190107,u5076,m336,ERIN,What do you mean?
175366,L190106,u5074,m336,ED,We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
175367,L190105,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here."
175368,L190104,u5074,m336,ED,"Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something."
175369,L190103,u5076,m336,ERIN,Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
175370,L190102,u5074,m336,ED,"Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work."
175371,L190099,u5076,m336,ERIN,No --
175372,L190098,u5074,m336,ED,No shit.
175373,L190097,u5076,m336,ERIN,"For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job."
175374,L190096,u5074,m336,ED,Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
175375,L190095,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please."
175376,L190094,u5074,m336,ED,They skipped that step.
175377,L190093,u5076,m336,ERIN,"See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --"
175378,L190092,u5076,m336,ERIN,"It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom."
175379,L190091,u5074,m336,ED,And that's what caused the contamination?
175380,L190090,u5076,m336,ERIN,"They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock."
175381,L190089,u5074,m336,ED,I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
175382,L190088,u5076,m336,ERIN,"They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds."
175383,L190074,u5076,m336,ERIN,<u>No</u>.
175384,L190073,u5074,m336,ED,You wanna talk about --
175385,L190065,u5076,m336,ERIN,She lived on the plume.  You never know.
175386,L190064,u5074,m336,ED,Is that what I think it is?
175387,L190020,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?"
175388,L190019,u5074,m336,ED,What now?
175389,L190017,u5074,m336,ED,"Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy."
175390,L190016,u5076,m336,ERIN,"You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry."
175391,L190015,u5074,m336,ED,"Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on."
175392,L190014,u5076,m336,ERIN,Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
175393,L190013,u5074,m336,ED,"This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal."
175394,L190012,u5076,m336,ERIN,Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
175395,L190011,u5074,m336,ED,You think there's more?
175396,L190010,u5076,m336,ERIN,Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
175397,L190009,u5074,m336,ED,How many families we talking about here?
175398,L190006,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --"
175399,L190005,u5074,m336,ED,"Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?"
175400,L190004,u5076,m336,ERIN,"We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall."
175401,L190003,u5074,m336,ED,"I know how DNA works, Erin --"
175402,L190002,u5076,m336,ERIN,"And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --"
175403,L190001,u5076,m336,ERIN,-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
175404,L190000,u5074,m336,ED,"-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm."
175405,L189999,u5076,m336,ERIN,Bullshit.
175406,L189998,u5074,m336,ED,It's not about working hard --
175407,L189997,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard."
175408,L189996,u5074,m336,ED,"Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute.  We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility.  No, thank you."
175409,L189995,u5076,m336,ERIN,That's crazy -- why not?
175410,L189994,u5074,m336,ED,Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
175411,L189971,u5076,m336,ERIN,"And I realized, he's taking a chance too."
175412,L189970,u5074,m336,ED,Then I don't get anything either.
175413,L189968,u5074,m336,ED,Erin --
175414,L189967,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?"

175416,L189965,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?"
175417,L189923,u5074,m336,ED,Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
175418,L189922,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours."
175419,L189918,u5074,m336,ED,"What, you think I'm made of money?"
175420,L189917,u5076,m336,ERIN,And you can't?
175421,L189916,u5074,m336,ED,Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
175422,L189915,u5076,m336,ERIN,I don't get why they'd do that.
175423,L189914,u5074,m336,ED,"That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you."
175424,L189913,u5076,m336,ERIN,At least they made an offer.
175425,L189895,u5074,m336,ED,It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
175426,L189894,u5076,m336,ERIN,So you think we got 'em scared?
175427,L189893,u5074,m336,ED,"I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting."
175428,L189855,u5074,m336,ED,Find out.
175429,L189854,u5076,m336,ERIN,So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
175430,L189853,u5074,m336,ED,This is the only thing you found?
175431,L189852,u5074,m336,ED,A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
175432,L189851,u5076,m336,ERIN,Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
175433,L189850,u5074,m336,ED,"Okay.  A 5% raise, and --"
175434,L189849,u5074,m336,ED,"Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense."
175435,L189848,u5076,m336,ERIN,I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
175436,L189847,u5074,m336,ED,"Lemme see it, will you?"
175437,L189846,u5076,m336,ERIN,Course I did.
175438,L189845,u5074,m336,ED,"That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?"
175439,L189844,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus."
175440,L189843,u5074,m336,ED,I didn't see any medical records in there.
175441,L189842,u5076,m336,ERIN,The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
175442,L189841,u5074,m336,ED,What medical records?
175443,L189840,u5076,m336,ERIN,It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
175444,L189839,u5074,m336,ED,So what made you think it was?
175445,L189838,u5076,m336,ERIN,"They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad."
175446,L189837,u5074,m336,ED,"But, PG&E told her about the chromium?"
175447,L189835,u5076,m336,ERIN,"You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay."
175448,L189834,u5074,m336,ED,So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
175449,L189833,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people."
175450,L189832,u5074,m336,ED,I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
175451,L189831,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Now, why in the hell would you assume that?"
175452,L189830,u5074,m336,ED,"Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun."
175453,L189829,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?"
175454,L189828,u5074,m336,ED,"He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings."
175455,L189827,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Oh, yeah?"
175456,L189826,u5074,m336,ED,I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
175457,L189825,u5076,m336,ERIN,What are you doing here?
175458,L189792,u5076,m336,ERIN,Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
175459,L189791,u5074,m336,ED,"Come on, I'm trying to help here."
175460,L189790,u5076,m336,ERIN,Don't bother.
175461,L189789,u5074,m336,ED,"Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?"
175462,L189784,u5074,m336,ED,That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
175463,L189783,u5076,m336,ERIN,I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
175464,L189782,u5074,m336,ED,"Erin, you've been gone for a week."
175465,L189613,u5076,m336,ERIN,I guess I'm not the right kind.
175466,L189612,u5074,m336,ED,How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
175467,L189611,u5076,m336,ERIN,Excuse me?
175468,L189610,u5074,m336,ED,You're a girl.
175469,L189609,u5074,m336,ED,Good.
175470,L189608,u5076,m336,ERIN,Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
175471,L189607,u5074,m336,ED,"You do know how to do that, don't you?"
175472,L189605,u5074,m336,ED,"Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it."
175473,L189604,u5076,m336,ERIN,Out to lunch with the girls.
175474,L189603,u5074,m336,ED,Where's Anna?
175475,L189602,u5076,m336,ERIN,Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
175476,L189576,u5074,m336,ED,"Bullshit, you don't."
175477,L189575,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry."
175478,L189574,u5074,m336,ED,All I have is hundreds.
175479,L189572,u5076,m336,ERIN,Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
175480,L189571,u5074,m336,ED,Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
175481,L189570,u5076,m336,ERIN,I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
175482,L189569,u5074,m336,ED,Yeah?
175483,L189561,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming."
175484,L189560,u5074,m336,ED,"Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rsum, make an --"
175485,L189557,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me."
175486,L189556,u5074,m336,ED,I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
175487,L189555,u5076,m336,ERIN,"You said things would be fine, and they're not."
175488,L189554,u5074,m336,ED,"I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --"
175489,L189553,u5076,m336,ERIN,"There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did both."
175490,L189552,u5074,m336,ED,"You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --"
175491,L189551,u5076,m336,ERIN,You never called me back.  I left messages.
175492,L189515,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids."
175493,L189514,u5074,m336,ED,"I'm sorry, Erin."
175494,L189513,u5076,m336,ERIN,"<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!"
175495,L189512,u5074,m336,ED,Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
175496,L189511,u5076,m336,ERIN,Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
175497,L189510,u5074,m336,ED,I told you the questions might get a little personal --
175498,L189509,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --"
175499,L189508,u5074,m336,ED,If you hadn't used profanity --
175500,L189507,u5076,m336,ERIN,Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
175501,L189492,u5074,m336,ED,Yeah.  I know.
175502,L189491,u5076,m336,ERIN,"... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?"
175503,L189490,u5076,m336,ERIN,"... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months."
175504,L189489,u5076,m336,ERIN,... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
175505,L189488,u5076,m336,ERIN,"They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now."
175506,L190295,u5086,m336,POTTER,I think we should makes some changes.
175507,L190294,u5074,m336,ED,Right.
175508,L190293,u5086,m336,POTTER,"I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --"
175509,L190266,u5086,m336,POTTER,Good.
175510,L190265,u5074,m336,ED,Corey.
175511,L190264,u5086,m336,POTTER,Who's the judge?
175512,L190261,u5074,m336,ED,Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
175513,L190260,u5086,m336,POTTER,How many counts?
175514,L190257,u5074,m336,ED,Yesterday.
175515,L190256,u5086,m336,POTTER,When'd they file the demur?
175516,L190469,u5075,m336,EMBRY,"At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was."
175517,L190468,u5076,m336,ERIN,How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
175518,L190467,u5075,m336,EMBRY,Well.  There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding.  That I kept instead.
175519,L190466,u5076,m336,ERIN,What do you mean?
175520,L190465,u5075,m336,EMBRY,"Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee."
175521,L190464,u5075,m336,EMBRY,That's right.
175522,L190463,u5076,m336,ERIN,And you were told to destroy those?
175523,L190462,u5075,m336,EMBRY,"There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like.  But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had readings from test wells, stuff like that."
175524,L190461,u5076,m336,ERIN,And ...?
175525,L190460,u5075,m336,EMBRY,"Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look."
175526,L190459,u5076,m336,ERIN,Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
175527,L190458,u5075,m336,EMBRY,Nope.  And I didn't ask.
175528,L190457,u5076,m336,ERIN,Did he say why?
175529,L190456,u5075,m336,EMBRY,"I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there."
175530,L190055,u5076,m336,ERIN,"The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night."
175531,L190054,u5088,m336,ROSS,I don't know what you're talking about.
175532,L190053,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?"
175533,L189872,u5076,m336,ERIN,Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
175534,L189871,u5088,m336,ROSS,"You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner."
175535,L189761,u5076,m336,ERIN,Not anymore.
175536,L189760,u5088,m336,ROSS,You're married.
175537,L189759,u5076,m336,ERIN,Nope.  Maiden.
175538,L189758,u5088,m336,ROSS,Pattee?  That your middle name?
175539,L189757,u5088,m336,ROSS,"Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --"
175540,L189756,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?"
175541,L189755,u5088,m336,ROSS,You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
175542,L189754,u5076,m336,ERIN,I guess I did.
175543,L189753,u5088,m336,ROSS,You come to the right place.
175544,L189752,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records."
175545,L189751,u5088,m336,ROSS,"Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?"
175546,L189750,u5076,m336,ERIN,Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
175547,L189749,u5088,m336,ROSS,Ross.
175548,L189748,u5076,m336,ERIN,Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
175549,L189747,u5088,m336,ROSS,"Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there."
175550,L189744,u5077,m336,FRANKEL,Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
175551,L189743,u5076,m336,ERIN,"County water board.  All righty, thanks."
175552,L189742,u5077,m336,FRANKEL,Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
175553,L189741,u5076,m336,ERIN,Hunh-uh.  What's that?
175554,L189740,u5077,m336,FRANKEL,Have you been to the water board?
175555,L189739,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?"
175556,L189738,u5077,m336,FRANKEL,"Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff."
175557,L189737,u5076,m336,ERIN,So that stuff -- it kills people.
175558,L189736,u5077,m336,FRANKEL,"With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer."
175559,L189735,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?"
175560,L189734,u5077,m336,FRANKEL,"Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful."
175561,L189733,u5076,m336,ERIN,There's more than one kind?
175562,L189732,u5077,m336,FRANKEL,What kind of chromium is it?
175563,L190186,u5076,m336,ERIN,George!
175564,L190185,u5080,m336,KATIE,I don't know.
175565,L190184,u5076,m336,ERIN,What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
175566,L189948,u5076,m336,ERIN,That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
175567,L189947,u5080,m336,KATIE,It happens all the time.
175568,L189946,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes."
175569,L189865,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet."
175570,L189864,u5080,m336,KATIE,Yeah.  A real moron.
175571,L189861,u5080,m336,KATIE,I'm gonna hate it.
175572,L189860,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before."
175573,L189859,u5080,m336,KATIE,I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
175574,L189578,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch."
175575,L189577,u5080,m336,KATIE,"Mommy, can I get a flower?"
175576,L189531,u5080,m336,KATIE,How come you're not eating?
175577,L189530,u5076,m336,ERIN,Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
175578,L190513,u5087,m336,ROSALIND,"Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?"
175579,L190512,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?"
175580,L190471,u5087,m336,ROSALIND,In the conference --
175581,L190470,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Hey, Ros, where are they?"
175582,L190308,u5087,m336,ROSALIND,"Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane."
175583,L190307,u5076,m336,ERIN,PG& -- Are you sure?
175584,L190306,u5087,m336,ROSALIND,Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
175585,L190305,u5076,m336,ERIN,What's going on in there?
175586,L190304,u5076,m336,ERIN,So did I.
175587,L190303,u5087,m336,ROSALIND,"Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day."
175588,L189927,u5087,m336,ROSALIND,"Hey, just so long as you see Him."
175589,L189926,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word ""dog"" and see ""god""."
175590,L189925,u5087,m336,ROSALIND,You've been reading for hours.
175591,L189659,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office."
175592,L189658,u5087,m336,ROSALIND,"Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?"
175593,L190443,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Cause her own mom's real sick, too."
175594,L190442,u5083,m336,MATTHEW,How come her own mom isn't helping her?
175595,L190441,u5076,m336,ERIN,Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
175596,L190440,u5083,m336,MATTHEW,She's one of the sick people?
175597,L190344,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise."
175598,L190343,u5083,m336,MATTHEW,You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
175599,L190342,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short."
175600,L190341,u5083,m336,MATTHEW,You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
175601,L190340,u5076,m336,ERIN,"We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise."
175602,L190338,u5083,m336,MATTHEW,I'm gonna go live with George.
175603,L190337,u5076,m336,ERIN,"God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?"
175604,L190227,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house."
175605,L190226,u5083,m336,MATTHEW,Randy's mom said yes right away.
175606,L190225,u5083,m336,MATTHEW,When?
175607,L190224,u5076,m336,ERIN,We'll see.
175608,L190223,u5083,m336,MATTHEW,Can I play roller hockey?
175609,L189867,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Thank God we got you away from her, huh?"
175610,L189866,u5083,m336,MATTHEW,Yeah.
175611,L189858,u5083,m336,MATTHEW,Well I hate it.
175612,L189857,u5076,m336,ERIN,There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
175613,L190285,u5076,m336,ERIN,"That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes."
175614,L190284,u5089,m336,THERESA,"Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --"
175615,L190282,u5076,m336,ERIN,Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
175616,L190281,u5089,m336,THERESA,Annabelle Daniels.
175617,L190280,u5089,m336,THERESA,You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
175618,L190279,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?"
175619,L190278,u5089,m336,THERESA,Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
175620,L190277,u5076,m336,ERIN,Whose number do you need?
175621,L190276,u5089,m336,THERESA,Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
175622,L190275,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will."
175623,L190274,u5089,m336,THERESA,No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
175624,L190273,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research."
175625,L190272,u5089,m336,THERESA,"Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research."
175626,L190271,u5076,m336,ERIN,Hey -- those are my files --
175627,L190450,u5076,m336,ERIN,I will.  Bye.
175628,L190449,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
175629,L190435,u5078,m336,GEORGE,We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
175630,L190434,u5076,m336,ERIN,"No, I need my car --"
175631,L190433,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
175632,L190432,u5076,m336,ERIN,What time is it?
175633,L190424,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't."
175634,L190423,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick."
175635,L190422,u5076,m336,ERIN,You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
175636,L190421,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Think you could learn?
175637,L190418,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find."
175638,L190417,u5076,m336,ERIN,And I miss you.
175639,L190416,u5076,m336,ERIN,I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
175640,L190415,u5078,m336,GEORGE,How long's this whole thing gonna take?
175641,L190414,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere."
175642,L190413,u5078,m336,GEORGE,They up?
175643,L190411,u5076,m336,ERIN,It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
175644,L190410,u5078,m336,GEORGE,I don't do favors for you anymore.
175645,L190409,u5076,m336,ERIN,Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
175646,L190408,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Hello?
175647,L190357,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Mm-hm.
175648,L190356,u5076,m336,ERIN,Thank you.
175649,L190355,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
175650,L190354,u5076,m336,ERIN,They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
175651,L190203,u5078,m336,GEORGE,I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
175652,L190202,u5076,m336,ERIN,You already packed up your stuff?
175653,L190200,u5076,m336,ERIN,I need it.
175654,L190199,u5078,m336,GEORGE,More than you need me.
175655,L190198,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it."
175656,L190197,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time."
175657,L190196,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I can't leave my job, George."
175658,L190195,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em."
175659,L190194,u5076,m336,ERIN,I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
175660,L190193,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time."
175661,L190192,u5076,m336,ERIN,What's that?
175662,L190191,u5078,m336,GEORGE,About this.
175663,L190190,u5076,m336,ERIN,About what?
175664,L190189,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Thinking.
175665,L190188,u5076,m336,ERIN,What's going on?  What are you doing?
175666,L190141,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit."
175667,L190140,u5076,m336,ERIN,That is not what I'm --
175668,L190139,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
175669,L190138,u5076,m336,ERIN,What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
175670,L190137,u5078,m336,GEORGE,It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
175671,L190132,u5076,m336,ERIN,"No, I wanna say hi."
175672,L190131,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Lock the door.
175673,L190130,u5076,m336,ERIN,That's Ed.
175674,L190122,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party."
175675,L190121,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?"
175676,L190069,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?"
175677,L190068,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"I'm bored, and so are the kids."
175678,L190062,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, ""ball."""
175679,L190061,u5076,m336,ERIN,What?  Beth?  My Beth?
175680,L190060,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking."
175681,L190059,u5076,m336,ERIN,"No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?"
175682,L190058,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"What do you want, a joke?"
175683,L190057,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?"
175684,L190052,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you."
175685,L190051,u5076,m336,ERIN,Keep your voice down.
175686,L190050,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
175687,L190049,u5076,m336,ERIN,I didn't say that.
175688,L190048,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so."
175689,L190047,u5076,m336,ERIN,Nothing.
175690,L190046,u5078,m336,GEORGE,You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
175691,L190045,u5076,m336,ERIN,How would you know?
175692,L190044,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there."
175693,L190043,u5076,m336,ERIN,"No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong."
175694,L190042,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?"
175695,L190041,u5076,m336,ERIN,I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
175696,L190040,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger."
175697,L190039,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George."
175698,L190027,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can."
175699,L190026,u5078,m336,GEORGE,I'm just saying --
175700,L190025,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now."
175701,L190024,u5078,m336,GEORGE,One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
175702,L190023,u5076,m336,ERIN,"George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?"
175703,L189818,u5078,m336,GEORGE,You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
175704,L189817,u5076,m336,ERIN,No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
175705,L189816,u5078,m336,GEORGE,You are someone.
175706,L189815,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone."
175707,L189814,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"You're not nothing, Erin."
175708,L189813,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?"
175709,L189812,u5078,m336,GEORGE,What?  But you been working so hard --
175710,L189811,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired."
175711,L189810,u5078,m336,GEORGE,It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
175712,L189809,u5076,m336,ERIN,What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
175713,L189799,u5078,m336,GEORGE,I'm gonna clean it up.
175714,L189798,u5076,m336,ERIN,Great.
175715,L189796,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Fixing a leak under your sink.
175716,L189795,u5076,m336,ERIN,What are you doing here?
175717,L189720,u5078,m336,GEORGE,What do you mean?
175718,L189719,u5076,m336,ERIN,"You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?"
175719,L189718,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"I guess we get what we pay for, huh?"
175720,L189717,u5076,m336,ERIN,Thanks for reminding me.
175721,L189716,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know."
175722,L189714,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Better safe than sorry.
175723,L189713,u5076,m336,ERIN,What're you doing?
175724,L189654,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?"
175725,L189653,u5076,m336,ERIN,"This isn't gonna get you laid, you know."
175726,L189652,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady."
175727,L189651,u5076,m336,ERIN,You're around every afternoon?
175728,L189649,u5076,m336,ERIN,Right.
175729,L189648,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
175730,L189647,u5076,m336,ERIN,Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
175731,L189646,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it."
175732,L189645,u5076,m336,ERIN,It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
175733,L189644,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
175734,L189643,u5076,m336,ERIN,I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
175735,L189642,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap."
175736,L189641,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?"
175737,L189640,u5078,m336,GEORGE,I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
175738,L189639,u5076,m336,ERIN,Great.  Another deadbeat.
175739,L189638,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons."
175740,L189637,u5076,m336,ERIN,I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
175741,L189636,u5078,m336,GEORGE,How?
175742,L189635,u5076,m336,ERIN,Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
175743,L189627,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Yeah, and whose fault is that?"
175744,L189626,u5076,m336,ERIN,Cause I don't even know you.
175745,L189625,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Why not?
175746,L189624,u5076,m336,ERIN,I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
175747,L189623,u5078,m336,GEORGE,You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
175748,L189622,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that."
175749,L189620,u5076,m336,ERIN,Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
175750,L189619,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night."
175751,L189618,u5076,m336,ERIN,No.
175752,L189597,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it."
175753,L189596,u5078,m336,GEORGE,You got a little girl?
175754,L189595,u5076,m336,ERIN,Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
175755,L189594,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Ten?
175756,L189593,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten."
175757,L189592,u5078,m336,GEORGE,You got more than one?
175758,L189591,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Which number do you want, George?"
175759,L189590,u5078,m336,GEORGE,I do.
175760,L189589,u5076,m336,ERIN,You want my number?
175761,L189587,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?"
175762,L189586,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine."
175763,L189585,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?"
175764,L189584,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up."
175765,L189583,u5078,m336,GEORGE,Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
175766,L189582,u5076,m336,ERIN,"What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?"
175767,L189581,u5078,m336,GEORGE,"Well, hello to you, darlin'."
175768,L190086,u5076,m336,ERIN,"A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one."
175769,L190085,u5081,m336,LAURA,"I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost."
175770,L190084,u5076,m336,ERIN,Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
175771,L190083,u5081,m336,LAURA,"Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar."
175772,L190082,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I'm real sorry, Laura."
175773,L190081,u5081,m336,LAURA,It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
175774,L190080,u5076,m336,ERIN,That's okay.  I understand.
175775,L190079,u5081,m336,LAURA,I'm embarrassed.
175776,L190210,u5079,m336,JANE,You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
175777,L190209,u5076,m336,ERIN,Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
175778,L190208,u5079,m336,JANE,I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
175779,L190207,u5076,m336,ERIN,What?
175780,L190206,u5079,m336,JANE,Have you been logging on?
175781,L190205,u5076,m336,ERIN,Where's my paycheck?
175782,L189788,u5079,m336,JANE,<u>Excuse me</u>?
175783,L189787,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I am not talking to you, bitch."
175784,L189786,u5079,m336,JANE,Yes.  It's called accountability.
175785,L189785,u5076,m336,ERIN,"What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?"
175786,L189779,u5079,m336,JANE,"There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay."
175787,L189778,u5076,m336,ERIN,What's going on?
175788,L189777,u5079,m336,JANE,"-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here."
175789,L189776,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --"
175790,L189775,u5079,m336,JANE,"Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you."
175791,L189774,u5076,m336,ERIN,Someone stole my stuff.
175792,L189657,u5079,m336,JANE,"What do I look like, Erin?  A library?"
175793,L189656,u5076,m336,ERIN,"I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know."
175794,L189978,u5082,m336,MANDY,"Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ..."
175795,L189977,u5076,m336,ERIN,Uh-huh?
175796,L189976,u5082,m336,MANDY,You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
175797,L189941,u5076,m336,ERIN,I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
175798,L189940,u5082,m336,MANDY,I know.  It's an awful lot.
175799,L189937,u5076,m336,ERIN,What?
175800,L189936,u5082,m336,MANDY,"There's something else, too."
175801,L189935,u5076,m336,ERIN,"It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot."
175802,L189934,u5082,m336,MANDY,"When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too."
175803,L189929,u5076,m336,ERIN,Yeah.  Who are you?
175804,L189928,u5082,m336,MANDY,"Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?"
175805,L189526,u5084,m336,MRS. MORALES,"I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door."
175806,L189525,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Wow, that's soon --"
175807,L189524,u5084,m336,MRS. MORALES,Next week.
175808,L189523,u5076,m336,ERIN,You're moving away?  When?
175809,L189522,u5084,m336,MRS. MORALES,"My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her."
175810,L189521,u5076,m336,ERIN,What?
175811,L189520,u5084,m336,MRS. MORALES,"Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --"
175812,L189519,u5076,m336,ERIN,"It'll be fine, yeah."
175813,L189518,u5084,m336,MRS. MORALES,Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
175814,L189517,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?"
175815,L189731,u5076,m336,ERIN,Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
175816,L189730,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,"I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study."
175817,L189729,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,"Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC."
175818,L189728,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water."
175819,L189727,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,You did?
175820,L189726,u5076,m336,ERIN,"... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked."
175821,L189674,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,"Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer."
175822,L189673,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Their parents, I'm pretty sure."
175823,L189672,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,"They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --"
175824,L189671,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Right, I guess those are the kids --"
175825,L189670,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,"Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?"
175826,L189669,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,"Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --"
175827,L189668,u5076,m336,ERIN,No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
175828,L189667,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,Oh.  Oh.
175829,L189665,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,"He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!"
175830,L189664,u5076,m336,ERIN,Who's Baxter?
175831,L189663,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
175832,L189662,u5076,m336,ERIN,"Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it."
175833,L189661,u5085,m336,PAULSEN,Yes?
175834,L189660,u5076,m336,ERIN,Dr. Paulsen?
175835,L191966,u5104,m337,VADER,And code the signal to my private chamber.
175836,L191965,u5090,m337,ADMIRAL,"Yes, My Lord."
175837,L191964,u5104,m337,VADER,Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
175838,L191963,u5090,m337,ADMIRAL,"Yes, he commands you make contact with him ...."
175839,L191962,u5104,m337,VADER,The Emperor?
175840,L191961,u5090,m337,ADMIRAL,It was .... the Emperor ....
175841,L192205,u5091,m337,ADMIRAL PIETT,"Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them."
175842,L192204,u5104,m337,VADER,"Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!"
175843,L192203,u5091,m337,ADMIRAL PIETT,"Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now."
175844,L191932,u5104,m337,VADER,"Yes, Admiral .... soon."
175845,L191931,u5091,m337,ADMIRAL PIETT,"Soon, Lord Vader."
175846,L191930,u5104,m337,VADER,"Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?"
175847,L191929,u5091,m337,ADMIRAL PIETT,"Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field."
175848,L191928,u5104,m337,VADER,"Come in, Admiral."
175849,L191927,u5091,m337,ADMIRAL PIETT,My lord.
175850,L192357,u5105,m337,YODA,No ... there is another.
175851,L192356,u5092,m337,BEN,The boy is our last hope.
175852,L192355,u5105,m337,YODA,"Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse."
175853,L192353,u5105,m337,YODA,"Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you."
175854,L192352,u5092,m337,BEN,"Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship."
175855,L192345,u5092,m337,BEN,"You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient."
175856,L192344,u5105,m337,YODA,Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
175857,L192086,u5092,m337,BEN,We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
175858,L192085,u5105,m337,YODA,Will he finish what he begins?
175859,L192083,u5105,m337,YODA,He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
175860,L192082,u5092,m337,BEN,He'll learn.
175861,L192079,u5105,m337,YODA,"This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!"
175862,L192078,u5092,m337,BEN,He can do it.
175863,L192073,u5092,m337,BEN,We've discussed this before.
175864,L192072,u5105,m337,YODA,"Much anger in him, like in his father."
175865,L192071,u5092,m337,BEN,He will learn patience.
175866,L192343,u5092,m337,BEN,"Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now."
175867,L192342,u5100,m337,LUKE,You won't.
175868,L192341,u5092,m337,BEN,"Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader."
175869,L192340,u5100,m337,LUKE,And that is why I must go.
175870,L192339,u5092,m337,BEN,Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
175871,L192336,u5092,m337,BEN,"But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side."
175872,L192335,u5100,m337,LUKE,I feel The Force.
175873,L192334,u5092,m337,BEN,You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
175874,L192333,u5100,m337,LUKE,I can help them!
175875,L192332,u5092,m337,BEN,You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
175876,L192331,u5100,m337,LUKE,But Han and Leia will surely die.
175877,L192330,u5092,m337,BEN,"... Luke, you must not go."
175878,L191662,u5092,m337,BEN,Luke ... you are the only hope.
175879,L191661,u5100,m337,LUKE,Ben ... Ben ...
175880,L191660,u5092,m337,BEN,"You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master."
175881,L191659,u5100,m337,LUKE,I'm cold ... so cold ...
175882,L191658,u5092,m337,BEN,"You must survive, Luke."
175883,L191657,u5092,m337,BEN,"You must.  Luke, look at me!"
175884,L191656,u5100,m337,LUKE,I can't ...
175885,L192541,u5098,m337,LANDO,We're not out of this yet.
175886,L192540,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Howls.
175887,L192531,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Okay, okay."
175888,L192530,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,"Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl."
175889,L192527,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks an argument and shakes his head.
175890,L192526,u5098,m337,LANDO,Three patrol ships are heading our way.
175891,L192440,u5098,m337,LANDO,What's wrong with him?
175892,L192439,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks a blue streak.
175893,L192315,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Everyone's invited, of course."
175894,L192314,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
175895,L192258,u5098,m337,LANDO,Right.
175896,L192257,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Growls a reserved greeting.
175897,L192256,u5098,m337,LANDO,"How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?"
175898,L192415,u5097,m337,HAN,"I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over."
175899,L192414,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks a doleful farewell.
175900,L192376,u5097,m337,HAN,"No, I'm alright.  I'm alright."
175901,L192375,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks his concern.
175902,L192324,u5097,m337,HAN,"Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?"
175903,L192323,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks at Han.
175904,L192306,u5097,m337,HAN,Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
175905,L192305,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
175906,L192243,u5097,m337,HAN,"That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you."
175907,L192242,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks and growls at his boss.
175908,L192241,u5097,m337,HAN,"Well, it's been awhile."
175909,L192549,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks his agreement.
175910,L192548,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Okay, Chewie, it's now or never."
175911,L192525,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Chewie, head for the bottom of the city."
175912,L192524,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks his consternation.
175913,L192482,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Howls.
175914,L192481,u5099,m337,LEIA,... the power?
175915,L192476,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks his right on!
175916,L192475,u5099,m337,LEIA,I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
175917,L192472,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks his agreement.
175918,L192471,u5099,m337,LEIA,We should have stayed and finished them off.
175919,L192300,u5099,m337,LEIA,What happened?
175920,L192299,u5093,m337,CHEWIE,Barks at his master.
175921,L192068,u5100,m337,LUKE,How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
175922,L192067,u5094,m337,CREATURE,"Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi."
175923,L192066,u5100,m337,LUKE,"Because of my father, I guess."
175924,L192065,u5094,m337,CREATURE,"Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?"
175925,L192064,u5100,m337,LUKE,Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
175926,L192063,u5094,m337,CREATURE,"It's the Jedi's time to eat, too."
175927,L192062,u5100,m337,LUKE,"Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now."
175928,L192061,u5094,m337,CREATURE,Patience.  It's time to eat.
175929,L192060,u5100,m337,LUKE,"... I told you, I'm not hungry."

175931,L192018,u5100,m337,LUKE,You know the Jedi Master?
175932,L192017,u5094,m337,CREATURE,"Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda."
175933,L192016,u5100,m337,LUKE,I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
175934,L192015,u5094,m337,CREATURE,"No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend."
175935,L192014,u5100,m337,LUKE,"Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do."

175937,L192010,u5094,m337,CREATURE,Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
175938,L192009,u5100,m337,LUKE,I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
175939,L192008,u5094,m337,CREATURE,Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
175940,L192007,u5100,m337,LUKE,Give me that!
175941,L192006,u5094,m337,CREATURE,Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?

175951,L191655,u5097,m337,HAN,Then I'll see you in Hell.
175952,L191654,u5095,m337,DECK SERGEANT,The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
175953,L191653,u5097,m337,HAN,You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
175954,L191652,u5095,m337,DECK SERGEANT,The temperature is dropping too fast.
175955,L191651,u5097,m337,HAN,We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
175956,L191650,u5095,m337,DECK SERGEANT,We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
175957,L191649,u5097,m337,HAN,Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
175958,L191648,u5095,m337,DECK SERGEANT,"Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in."
175959,L191642,u5097,m337,HAN,"Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!"
175960,L191641,u5095,m337,DECK SERGEANT,I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.

175962,L191639,u5095,m337,DECK SERGEANT,Yes sir!
175963,L192100,u5104,m337,VADER,"He will join us or die, My Master."
175964,L192099,u5096,m337,EMPEROR,Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
175965,L192098,u5104,m337,VADER,"But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally."
175966,L192097,u5096,m337,EMPEROR,You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
175967,L192096,u5104,m337,VADER,"He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ..."
175968,L192095,u5096,m337,EMPEROR,The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
175969,L192094,u5104,m337,VADER,Our destruction?  Who?
175970,L192093,u5096,m337,EMPEROR,Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
175971,L192092,u5104,m337,VADER,I have felt it.
175972,L192091,u5096,m337,EMPEROR,There is a grave disturbance in The Force.

175974,L191711,u5097,m337,HAN,Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
175975,L191710,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
175976,L191709,u5097,m337,HAN,"Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie."
175977,L191603,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,"I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you."
175978,L191602,u5097,m337,HAN,"Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man."
175979,L191601,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
175980,L191600,u5097,m337,HAN,That's right.
175981,L191598,u5097,m337,HAN,The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
175982,L191597,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,"With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships."
175983,L191596,u5097,m337,HAN,He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
175984,L191595,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,"Good, and Commander Skywalker?"
175985,L191594,u5097,m337,HAN,"There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling."
175986,L191593,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
175987,L192157,u5097,m337,HAN,"Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive."
175988,L192156,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir."
175989,L192126,u5097,m337,HAN,"Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ..."
175990,L192125,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ..."
175991,L192106,u5097,m337,HAN,I'm going to see what it is.
175992,L192105,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,It sounds like it's trying to get in.
175993,L191988,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
175994,L191987,u5097,m337,HAN,"You, too, golden rod."
175995,L191969,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?"
175996,L191968,u5097,m337,HAN,What are you so grouchy about?
175997,L191907,u5097,m337,HAN,We're in trouble!
175998,L191906,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged."
175999,L191905,u5097,m337,HAN,I think we're in trouble.
176000,L191897,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,It can wait.
176001,L191896,u5097,m337,HAN,"Sit down, and shut up!"
176002,L191895,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"Sir, I was wondering ..."
176003,L191857,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
176004,L191856,u5097,m337,HAN,Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
176005,L191686,u5097,m337,HAN,"The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold."
176006,L191685,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
176007,L191684,u5097,m337,HAN,"He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie."
176008,L191644,u5097,m337,HAN,Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
176009,L191643,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?"
176010,L191636,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ..."
176011,L191635,u5097,m337,HAN,I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
176012,L191634,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like."
176013,L191633,u5097,m337,HAN,What is it?
176014,L191632,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?"
176015,L192417,u5097,m337,HAN,"... just remember that, cause I'll be back ..."
176016,L192416,u5099,m337,LEIA,"... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true."
176017,L192379,u5097,m337,HAN,"Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions."
176018,L192378,u5099,m337,LEIA,I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
176019,L192377,u5097,m337,HAN,I was worried about you.
176020,L192308,u5097,m337,HAN,"Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ..."
176021,L192307,u5099,m337,LEIA,No thanks.
176022,L192304,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Chewie, do you think you can repair him?"
176023,L192303,u5097,m337,HAN,"Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident."
176024,L192302,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him."
176025,L192301,u5097,m337,HAN,He found him in a junk pile ...
176026,L192298,u5097,m337,HAN,Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
176027,L192297,u5099,m337,LEIA,I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
176028,L192296,u5097,m337,HAN,Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
176029,L192295,u5099,m337,LEIA,Has Threepio turned up yet?
176030,L192294,u5097,m337,HAN,You look great.
176031,L192293,u5099,m337,LEIA,You look silly.
176032,L192292,u5097,m337,HAN,Who's staring?
176033,L192291,u5099,m337,LEIA,What are you staring at?
176034,L192250,u5097,m337,HAN,It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
176035,L192249,u5099,m337,LEIA,I don't like this.
176036,L192228,u5097,m337,HAN,"Let er go, Chewie."
176037,L192227,u5099,m337,LEIA,"You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them."
176038,L192225,u5097,m337,HAN,"No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ..."
176039,L192224,u5099,m337,LEIA,Can you trust him?
176040,L192223,u5097,m337,HAN,"A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back."
176041,L192222,u5099,m337,LEIA,A mining colony.
176042,L192221,u5097,m337,HAN,"Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable."
176043,L192220,u5099,m337,LEIA,Never heard of that system.
176044,L192219,u5097,m337,HAN,"Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian."
176045,L192218,u5099,m337,LEIA,"You keep logs?  My, how organized."
176046,L192217,u5097,m337,HAN,"Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs."
176047,L192216,u5097,m337,HAN,Here ... near the Anoat system.
176048,L192215,u5099,m337,LEIA,That depends.  Where are we?
176049,L192214,u5097,m337,HAN,Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
176050,L192213,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?"
176051,L192212,u5097,m337,HAN,The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
176052,L192211,u5099,m337,LEIA,What'd you have in mind for your next move?
176053,L192210,u5097,m337,HAN,"Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws."
176054,L192209,u5099,m337,LEIA,I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
176055,L192208,u5097,m337,HAN,"Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?"
176056,L192207,u5099,m337,LEIA,You could have warned him before you shut him off.
176057,L192166,u5099,m337,LEIA,You're going to attack them?!!!
176058,L192165,u5097,m337,HAN,"Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield."
176059,L192162,u5097,m337,HAN,It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
176060,L192161,u5099,m337,LEIA,No lightspeed?
176061,L192160,u5097,m337,HAN,"Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it."
176062,L192124,u5099,m337,LEIA,The entrance is collapsing!
176063,L192123,u5097,m337,HAN,"I see it Chewie, hang on."
176064,L192122,u5099,m337,LEIA,But the tremors have stopped.
176065,L192121,u5097,m337,HAN,"Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!"
176066,L192120,u5099,m337,LEIA,Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
176067,L192112,u5097,m337,HAN,There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
176068,L192111,u5099,m337,LEIA,Looks like some kind of Mynock.
176069,L192108,u5097,m337,HAN,"Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ..."
176070,L192107,u5099,m337,LEIA,Are you crazy!
176071,L192104,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Outside, in the cave."
176072,L192103,u5097,m337,HAN,Where?
176073,L192102,u5099,m337,LEIA,There's something out there!
176074,L192057,u5097,m337,HAN,Try and control this ...
176075,L192056,u5099,m337,LEIA,I do not!
176076,L192055,u5097,m337,HAN,You mean a man you can control.
176077,L192054,u5099,m337,LEIA,There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
176078,L192053,u5097,m337,HAN,"Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull."
176079,L192052,u5099,m337,LEIA,Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
176080,L192049,u5099,m337,LEIA,Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
176081,L192048,u5097,m337,HAN,What are you afraid of?
176082,L192046,u5097,m337,HAN,Why?
176083,L192045,u5099,m337,LEIA,Stop that.
176084,L192044,u5097,m337,HAN,That's quite a compliment.
176085,L192043,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel."
176086,L192042,u5097,m337,HAN,"You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right."
176087,L192041,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Yes, you do."
176088,L192040,u5097,m337,HAN,Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
176089,L192039,u5099,m337,LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that?
176090,L192038,u5097,m337,HAN,"Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help."
176091,L192035,u5099,m337,LEIA,Where have I heard that before?
176092,L192034,u5097,m337,HAN,They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
176093,L192033,u5099,m337,LEIA,They're moving away.
176094,L192031,u5099,m337,LEIA,Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
176095,L192030,u5097,m337,HAN,That was no earthquake.
176096,L191984,u5097,m337,HAN,Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
176097,L191983,u5099,m337,LEIA,"I don't expect anything, except to be left alone."
176098,L191982,u5097,m337,HAN,"Well, I hope you don't expect more."
176099,L191981,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited."
176100,L191979,u5097,m337,HAN,Beautiful.
176101,L191978,u5099,m337,LEIA,How do I look?
176102,L191977,u5097,m337,HAN,You don't look angry.
176103,L191976,u5099,m337,LEIA,Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
176104,L191975,u5097,m337,HAN,"Why, Princess, this is so sudden."
176105,L191947,u5097,m337,HAN,That should do nicely.
176106,L191946,u5099,m337,LEIA,What is it?
176107,L191945,u5097,m337,HAN,"There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good."
176108,L191941,u5097,m337,HAN,Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
176109,L191940,u5099,m337,LEIA,Now you're making sense.
176110,L191939,u5097,m337,HAN,We've got to get out of this shower.
176111,L191938,u5099,m337,LEIA,I'm against that.
176112,L191937,u5097,m337,HAN,But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
176113,L191936,u5099,m337,LEIA,Good.
176114,L191935,u5097,m337,HAN,That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
176115,L191934,u5099,m337,LEIA,I take it back.
176116,L191933,u5097,m337,HAN,"Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong."
176117,L191924,u5097,m337,HAN,"Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'."
176118,L191923,u5099,m337,LEIA,To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
176119,L191922,u5097,m337,HAN,Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
176120,L191921,u5099,m337,LEIA,Probably an asteroid field ....
176121,L191920,u5097,m337,HAN,"Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ..."
176122,L191919,u5099,m337,LEIA,Or you ran into something ....
176123,L191918,u5097,m337,HAN,That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
176124,L191894,u5099,m337,LEIA,"I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried."
176125,L191893,u5097,m337,HAN,Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
176126,L191892,u5097,m337,HAN,"I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?"
176127,L191874,u5099,m337,LEIA,I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
176128,L191873,u5097,m337,HAN,This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
176129,L191872,u5099,m337,LEIA,This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
176130,L191869,u5097,m337,HAN,"Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started."
176131,L191868,u5099,m337,LEIA,Would it help if I got out and pushed?
176132,L191851,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures."
176133,L191850,u5097,m337,HAN,Hey!  Someone's still in here.
176134,L191771,u5097,m337,HAN,"Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?"
176135,L191770,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder."
176136,L191769,u5097,m337,HAN,"Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?"
176137,L191768,u5099,m337,LEIA,You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
176138,L191765,u5097,m337,HAN,Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
176139,L191764,u5099,m337,LEIA,I don't know what he's talking about.
176140,L191759,u5099,m337,LEIA,I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
176141,L191758,u5097,m337,HAN,"Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer."
176142,L191716,u5097,m337,HAN,Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
176143,L191715,u5099,m337,LEIA,An Imperial probe droid.
176144,L191714,u5097,m337,HAN,Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
176145,L191713,u5099,m337,LEIA,What was it?
176146,L191712,u5097,m337,HAN,.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
176147,L191691,u5097,m337,HAN,"No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere."
176148,L191690,u5099,m337,LEIA,Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
176149,L191688,u5097,m337,HAN,Forget it.
176150,L191687,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ..."
176151,L191627,u5097,m337,HAN,Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
176152,L191626,u5099,m337,LEIA,And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
176153,L191625,u5097,m337,HAN,Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
176154,L191624,u5099,m337,LEIA,We are fighting for a cause much ...
176155,L191623,u5097,m337,HAN,"There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here."
176156,L191622,u5099,m337,LEIA,I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
176157,L191621,u5097,m337,HAN,Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
176158,L191619,u5099,m337,LEIA,"I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about."
176159,L191618,u5097,m337,HAN,You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
176160,L191617,u5099,m337,LEIA,"And what are they, pray tell?"
176161,L191616,u5097,m337,HAN,You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
176162,L191615,u5099,m337,LEIA,Me?  I don't know what you mean.
176163,L191614,u5097,m337,HAN,Not you?
176164,L191613,u5099,m337,LEIA,Yes.
176165,L191612,u5097,m337,HAN,We?
176166,L191611,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Han, we need you here."
176167,L191610,u5097,m337,HAN,"He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head."
176168,L191609,u5099,m337,LEIA,Does Luke know?
176169,L191608,u5097,m337,HAN,That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
176170,L191607,u5099,m337,LEIA,You said you were going to stay. What happened?
176171,L191606,u5097,m337,HAN,"Yes, Your Highness?"
176172,L191798,u5097,m337,HAN,Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
176173,L191797,u5100,m337,LUKE,I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
176174,L191767,u5097,m337,HAN,"Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me."
176175,L191766,u5100,m337,LUKE,About what?
176176,L191761,u5097,m337,HAN,That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
176177,L191760,u5100,m337,LUKE,Probe?  What probe?
176178,L191757,u5097,m337,HAN,"That's two you owe me, junior."
176179,L191756,u5100,m337,LUKE,Thanks to you.
176180,L191755,u5097,m337,HAN,"Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark."
176181,L191588,u5100,m337,LUKE,I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
176182,L191587,u5097,m337,HAN,There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
176183,L191586,u5100,m337,LUKE,I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
176184,L191585,u5097,m337,HAN,"Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?"
176185,L192396,u5097,m337,HAN,"Yeah, you're a real hero."
176186,L192395,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ..."
176187,L192392,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Don't ask me, but he's on his way."
176188,L192391,u5097,m337,HAN,All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
176189,L192388,u5097,m337,HAN,Luke?  I don't get it.
176190,L192387,u5098,m337,LANDO,He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
176191,L192386,u5097,m337,HAN,You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
176192,L192383,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe."
176193,L192382,u5097,m337,HAN,This ought to be good.
176194,L192381,u5098,m337,LANDO,Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
176195,L192380,u5097,m337,HAN,"Get out of here, Lando!"
176196,L192327,u5097,m337,HAN,I'm sorry too.
176197,L192326,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did."
176198,L192272,u5097,m337,HAN,Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
176199,L192271,u5098,m337,LANDO,Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
176200,L192270,u5097,m337,HAN,How's your mining operation going?
176201,L192269,u5098,m337,LANDO,I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
176202,L192268,u5097,m337,HAN,Hyperdrive.
176203,L192267,u5098,m337,LANDO,That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
176204,L192265,u5098,m337,LANDO,What have you done to my ship?
176205,L192264,u5097,m337,HAN,Repairs ...
176206,L192263,u5098,m337,LANDO,"That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?"
176207,L192255,u5098,m337,LANDO,I'll bet.
176208,L192254,u5097,m337,HAN,I always said you were a gentleman.
176209,L192253,u5098,m337,LANDO,Are you kidding?
176210,L192252,u5097,m337,HAN,No hard feelings?
176211,L192251,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you."
176212,L192426,u5104,m337,VADER,I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
176213,L192425,u5098,m337,LANDO,That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
176214,L192424,u5104,m337,VADER,"Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them."
176215,L192423,u5098,m337,LANDO,I'll take what's mine now.
176216,L192403,u5104,m337,VADER,I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
176217,L192402,u5098,m337,LANDO,"We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him."
176218,L192370,u5104,m337,VADER,Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
176219,L192369,u5098,m337,LANDO,No.
176220,L192368,u5104,m337,VADER,"I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly."
176221,L192367,u5098,m337,LANDO,That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
176222,L192366,u5104,m337,VADER,You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
176223,L192365,u5098,m337,LANDO,What about Leia and the Wookiee?
176224,L192547,u5099,m337,LEIA,That sounds familiar.
176225,L192546,u5098,m337,LANDO,I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
176226,L192543,u5099,m337,LEIA,Are the coordinates set?
176227,L192542,u5098,m337,LANDO,The deflector shields are gone.
176228,L192535,u5099,m337,LEIA,"It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch."
176229,L192534,u5098,m337,LANDO,Someone's falling.
176230,L192529,u5098,m337,LANDO,Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
176231,L192528,u5099,m337,LEIA,"No argument, just do it.  That's a command!"
176232,L192523,u5099,m337,LEIA,Luke needs help.  We must go back.
176233,L192522,u5098,m337,LANDO,What?
176234,L192521,u5099,m337,LEIA,Luke!
176235,L192520,u5098,m337,LANDO,I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
176236,L192517,u5098,m337,LANDO,I didn't say anything?
176237,L192516,u5099,m337,LEIA,What'd you say?
176238,L192499,u5098,m337,LANDO,His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
176239,L192498,u5099,m337,LEIA,We've got to find Luke.
176240,L192489,u5098,m337,LANDO,Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
176241,L192488,u5099,m337,LEIA,"You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy."
176242,L192480,u5099,m337,LEIA,What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
176243,L192479,u5098,m337,LANDO,Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
176244,L192478,u5099,m337,LEIA,You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
176245,L192477,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Very noble.  Not smart, but noble."
176246,L192446,u5098,m337,LANDO,"There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform."
176247,L192445,u5099,m337,LEIA,Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
176248,L192438,u5098,m337,LANDO,"This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here."
176249,L192437,u5099,m337,LEIA,We have no use for your kind.
176250,L192436,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Look, I stand to lose everything by this."
176251,L192435,u5099,m337,LEIA,And when do you betray us again?
176252,L192434,u5098,m337,LANDO,"I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake."
176253,L192433,u5099,m337,LEIA,What's going on?
176254,L192390,u5099,m337,LEIA,... we're the bait.
176255,L192389,u5098,m337,LANDO,Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
176256,L192385,u5098,m337,LANDO,I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
176257,L192384,u5099,m337,LEIA,What about Han?
176258,L192322,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft."
176259,L192321,u5099,m337,LEIA,It's a lovely outpost.
176260,L192320,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial."
176261,L192319,u5099,m337,LEIA,You're part of the mining guild then?
176262,L192318,u5098,m337,LANDO,.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
176263,L192313,u5098,m337,LANDO,Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
176264,L192312,u5099,m337,LEIA,Thanks.
176265,L192311,u5098,m337,LANDO,"I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds."
176266,L192310,u5099,m337,LEIA,Not really.
176267,L192309,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Sorry, am I interrupting anything?"
176268,L192260,u5099,m337,LEIA,You may call me Leia.
176269,L192259,u5098,m337,LANDO,"Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?"
176270,L191823,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
176271,L191822,u5099,m337,LEIA,Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
176272,L191702,u5099,m337,LEIA,What is it?
176273,L191701,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,"We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East."
176274,L191695,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,Not yet.  They're working on it now.
176275,L191694,u5099,m337,LEIA,Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
176276,L191677,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,"Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ..."
176277,L191676,u5099,m337,LEIA,Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
176278,L191675,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
176279,L191674,u5099,m337,LEIA,I understand.
176280,L191673,u5102,m337,RIEEKAN,Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
176281,L192514,u5099,m337,LEIA,Let's go.
176282,L192513,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ..."
176283,L192240,u5099,m337,LEIA,I thought you knew this person.
176284,L192239,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"Rather touchy, aren't they."
176285,L192164,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Well, what now?"
176286,L192163,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for."
176287,L192128,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"Oh my, no!"
176288,L192127,u5099,m337,LEIA,What??
176289,L191972,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable."
176290,L191971,u5099,m337,LEIA,A tremor!
176291,L191943,u5099,m337,LEIA,Closer?!
176292,L191942,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,Closer?!
176293,L191926,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ..."
176294,L191925,u5099,m337,LEIA,You don't have to do this to impress me.
176295,L191739,u5099,m337,LEIA,I'll be back later.
176296,L191738,u5103,m337,THREEPIO,"So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir."
176297,L191737,u5099,m337,LEIA,You rest now.
176298,L192545,u5100,m337,LUKE,I've never seen it fail.
176299,L192544,u5099,m337,LEIA,This hyperdrive had better work.
176300,L192539,u5100,m337,LUKE,He'll survive.
176301,L192538,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?"
176302,L192428,u5099,m337,LEIA,"Luke, no!  It's a trap."
176303,L192427,u5100,m337,LUKE,Leia!
176304,L191752,u5100,m337,LUKE,Snow creatures ... they're here?!
176305,L191751,u5099,m337,LEIA,I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
176306,L191750,u5100,m337,LUKE,Jabba the Hutt?
176307,L191749,u5099,m337,LEIA,He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
176308,L191748,u5100,m337,LUKE,"Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han."
176309,L191747,u5100,m337,LUKE,Han's leaving?
176310,L191746,u5099,m337,LEIA,"First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ..."
176311,L191745,u5100,m337,LUKE,What are you talking about?
176312,L191744,u5099,m337,LEIA,That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
176313,L191743,u5100,m337,LUKE,"I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ..."
176314,L191742,u5099,m337,LEIA,Where are you going?
176315,L191741,u5099,m337,LEIA,What did you say?!
176316,L191740,u5100,m337,LUKE,Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
176317,L191731,u5099,m337,LEIA,Me too.  I was afraid.
176318,L191730,u5100,m337,LUKE,"I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things."
176319,L191729,u5099,m337,LEIA,The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
176320,L192347,u5105,m337,YODA,If it must be.  Yes.
176321,L192346,u5100,m337,LUKE,And sacrifice Han and Leia?
176322,L192338,u5100,m337,LUKE,"I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master."
176323,L192337,u5105,m337,YODA,"Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?"
176324,L192290,u5105,m337,YODA,"Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training."
176325,L192289,u5100,m337,LUKE,They're my friends.
176326,L192288,u5105,m337,YODA,"Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!"
176327,L192287,u5100,m337,LUKE,Will they die?
176328,L192286,u5105,m337,YODA,It is the future you see.
176329,L192285,u5100,m337,LUKE,I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
176330,L192284,u5105,m337,YODA,"Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will."
176331,L192283,u5100,m337,LUKE,I see a city in the clouds.
176332,L192282,u5105,m337,YODA,"Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast."
176333,L192281,u5100,m337,LUKE,My mind fills with so many images.
176334,L192280,u5105,m337,YODA,Free your mind and return he will.
176335,L192279,u5100,m337,LUKE,Ben?  Ben?
176336,L192235,u5105,m337,YODA,Only what you take with you.
176337,L192234,u5100,m337,LUKE,What's in there?
176338,L192233,u5105,m337,YODA,This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
176339,L192232,u5100,m337,LUKE,I feel cold.
176340,L192230,u5100,m337,LUKE,Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
176341,L192229,u5105,m337,YODA,Four this time!  The Force you feel.
176342,L192199,u5105,m337,YODA,No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
176343,L192198,u5100,m337,LUKE,But tell me why ...
176344,L192197,u5105,m337,YODA,You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
176345,L192196,u5100,m337,LUKE,But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
176346,L192195,u5105,m337,YODA,"No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive."
176347,L192194,u5100,m337,LUKE,Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
176348,L192193,u5105,m337,YODA,"The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice."
176349,L192192,u5100,m337,LUKE,Price?  What do you mean?
176350,L192191,u5105,m337,YODA,"Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring."
176351,L192190,u5100,m337,LUKE,But I feel The Force flowing!
176352,L192189,u5105,m337,YODA,"No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel."
176353,L192187,u5105,m337,YODA,That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
176354,L192186,u5100,m337,LUKE,They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
176355,L192185,u5105,m337,YODA,That they are.
176356,L192184,u5100,m337,LUKE,I thought those seekers were set for stun!
176357,L192183,u5105,m337,YODA,Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
176358,L192151,u5105,m337,YODA,That is why you fail.
176359,L192150,u5100,m337,LUKE,I don't believe it.
176360,L192147,u5105,m337,YODA,Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
176361,L192146,u5100,m337,LUKE,I can't. It's too big.
176362,L192145,u5105,m337,YODA,"No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try."
176363,L192144,u5100,m337,LUKE,Okay.  I'll give it a try.
176364,L192143,u5105,m337,YODA,No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
176365,L192142,u5100,m337,LUKE,"Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different."
176366,L192134,u5105,m337,YODA,"Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn."
176367,L192133,u5100,m337,LUKE,I thought I was in good shape.
176368,L192132,u5105,m337,YODA,"It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi."
176369,L192088,u5105,m337,YODA,"You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be."
176370,L192087,u5100,m337,LUKE,I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
176371,L192081,u5105,m337,YODA,You are reckless!
176372,L192080,u5100,m337,LUKE,I have followed my feelings.
176373,L192077,u5105,m337,YODA,"To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind."
176374,L192076,u5100,m337,LUKE,Why not me?
176375,L192075,u5105,m337,YODA,Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
176376,L192508,u5100,m337,LUKE,Never.
176377,L192507,u5104,m337,VADER,"There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!"
176378,L192506,u5100,m337,LUKE,No! .... Never ....
176379,L192505,u5104,m337,VADER,"The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor."
176380,L192458,u5100,m337,LUKE,Time will tell.
176381,L192457,u5104,m337,VADER,All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
176382,L192456,u5104,m337,VADER,That won't be necessary.
176383,L192455,u5100,m337,LUKE,I'll die first.
176384,L192454,u5104,m337,VADER,"There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training."
176385,L192453,u5100,m337,LUKE,No!
176386,L192452,u5104,m337,VADER,"Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true."
176387,L192451,u5104,m337,VADER,And I too.
176388,L192450,u5100,m337,LUKE,You'll find I'm full of surprises.
176389,L192449,u5104,m337,VADER,The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
176390,L191889,u5104,m337,VADER,I want that ship.
176391,L191888,u5101,m337,PIETT,It won't get through the blockade.
176392,L191887,u5104,m337,VADER,Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
176393,L191886,u5101,m337,PIETT,"Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away."
176394,L191782,u5104,m337,VADER,"Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett."
176395,L191781,u5101,m337,PIETT,"Yes, My Lord."
176396,L191723,u5101,m337,PIETT,"Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ..."
176397,L191722,u5104,m337,VADER,The Hoth System?
176398,L193448,u5107,m338,COLONEL,"What d'you mean, pretending? They are dressing.  Where'd they get those clothes?"
176399,L193447,u5106,m338,AIDE,They're...pretending to dress.
176400,L193446,u5107,m338,COLONEL,Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
176401,L193444,u5106,m338,AIDE,They suggested oranges.
176402,L193443,u5107,m338,COLONEL,Good God.
176403,L193442,u5106,m338,AIDE,"The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir."
176404,L193441,u5107,m338,COLONEL,"Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?"
176405,L193440,u5106,m338,AIDE,"Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased."
176406,L193439,u5107,m338,COLONEL,Did you call the Zoo?
176407,L193524,u5109,m338,LEWIS,That primitive apes can talk.
176408,L193523,u5108,m338,CORNELIUS,Believe what?
176409,L193522,u5109,m338,LEWIS,Nobody's going to believe it.
176410,L193521,u5109,m338,LEWIS,My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
176411,L193520,u5108,m338,CORNELIUS,My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
176412,L193519,u5109,m338,LEWIS,Do you have a name?
176413,L193518,u5108,m338,CORNELIUS,We know that.
176414,L193517,u5109,m338,LEWIS,So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
176415,L193498,u5108,m338,CORNELIUS,A display of primitive apparatus --
176416,L193497,u5110,m338,MILO,And we can watch ...
176417,L193496,u5108,m338,CORNELIUS,To a lot of psychiatric small talk --
176418,L193491,u5110,m338,MILO,I did not call her mad.  I merely asked her if she was.  And I repeat the question.  Are you mad?
176419,L193490,u5108,m338,CORNELIUS,"Dr. Milo, please don't call my wife mad."
176420,L193489,u5110,m338,MILO,"Zira, are you mad?"
176421,L193463,u5110,m338,MILO,"And Earth will be destroyed -- just as we saw it.  Only, since fleeing it, we have passed through a....backward disturbance in time -- did you notice the Date Meter clicking down after the shock wave hit our ship? -- and we have returned to Earth almost two thousand years before its destruction.  That is another reason for keeping silence.  Our human captors would not be edified to know that, one day, their world will crack like an egg and fry to a cinder, because of an Ape war of aggression."
176422,L193462,u5108,m338,CORNELIUS,But we saw Earth destroyed.
176423,L193461,u5110,m338,MILO,In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
176424,L193507,u5109,m338,LEWIS,Keep him in cold storage till the reports in.  Then send him to Taxidermy.  He's a museum piece.
176425,L193506,u5111,m338,STEVIE,With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
176426,L193505,u5109,m338,LEWIS,We shall want a full autopsy ...
176427,L193479,u5109,m338,LEWIS,"Yes, but don't take any chances."
176428,L193478,u5111,m338,STEVIE,They look pretty docile.
176429,L193477,u5109,m338,LEWIS,"Go easy, Stevie."
176430,L193472,u5109,m338,LEWIS,Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
176431,L193471,u5111,m338,STEVIE,What are they doing here?
176432,L193470,u5111,m338,STEVIE,I don't believe it.
176433,L193469,u5109,m338,LEWIS,"No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them."
176434,L193468,u5111,m338,STEVIE,With food?
176435,L193467,u5109,m338,LEWIS,There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
176436,L193466,u5111,m338,STEVIE,"What, Lewis?"
176437,L193529,u5112,m338,ZIRA,I like you.
176438,L193528,u5109,m338,LEWIS,Please
176439,L193527,u5112,m338,ZIRA,May I say something personal?
176440,L193526,u5109,m338,LEWIS,"I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People."
176441,L193525,u5112,m338,ZIRA,Primitive?
176442,L193516,u5112,m338,ZIRA,I'm a psychiatrist.
176443,L193515,u5109,m338,LEWIS,Humans?
176444,L193514,u5112,m338,ZIRA,I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
176445,L193513,u5109,m338,LEWIS,I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
176446,L193512,u5112,m338,ZIRA,He's a gorilla.
176447,L193511,u5109,m338,LEWIS,But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
176448,L194034,u5116,m339,MALLOY,"C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that."
176449,L194033,u5113,m339,BRAZEN,You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
176450,L193646,u5116,m339,MALLOY,"Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant."
176451,L193645,u5113,m339,BRAZEN,His reactor's starting to overheat.

176555,L193620,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,So what does this thing do?
176556,L193619,u5116,m339,MALLOY,"Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States."

176558,L193617,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Defense against what?
176559,L193616,u5116,m339,MALLOY,Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
176560,L193615,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,I'll need to know more about this thing.
176561,L193607,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Call me Snake.

176564,L193599,u5116,m339,MALLOY,You don't understand. It's already in you.
176565,L193598,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
176566,L193597,u5116,m339,MALLOY,Having second thoughts?
176567,L193596,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,"Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?"
176568,L193585,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
176569,L193584,u5116,m339,MALLOY,That's the deal.
176570,L193583,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,"So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?"
176571,L193582,u5116,m339,MALLOY,"That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back."
176572,L193581,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,"And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood."
176573,L193580,u5116,m339,MALLOY,Top secret. Only on a need to know.

176575,L193578,u5116,m339,MALLOY,"Shut up, Plissken."
176576,L193562,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
176577,L193561,u5116,m339,MALLOY,How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
176578,L194036,u5121,m339,PRESIDENT,"You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug."
176579,L194035,u5116,m339,MALLOY,"Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you."

176583,L193858,u5121,m339,PRESIDENT,So where's Plissken?
176584,L193857,u5116,m339,MALLOY,Getting ready to invade.
176585,L193589,u5121,m339,PRESIDENT,"I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man."
176586,L193588,u5116,m339,MALLOY,"It's the President, for Christ's sake!"
176587,L193975,u5117,m339,MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE,Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
176588,L193974,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Is that what I think it is?
176589,L193966,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,If he lets you get close enough.
176590,L193965,u5117,m339,MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE,So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.

176601,L193890,u5117,m339,MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE,"Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right."
176602,L193889,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Cease fire with the bullshit.
176603,L193888,u5117,m339,MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE,"I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man."

176605,L193886,u5117,m339,MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE,"Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?"
176606,L193885,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
176607,L193823,u5117,m339,MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE,I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...

176609,L193820,u5117,m339,MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE,"Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you."

176625,L193680,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Where'd they go?
176626,L193679,u5117,m339,MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE,"You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?"
176627,L193742,u5118,m339,PENDEJO BOB,All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
176628,L193741,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
176629,L193740,u5118,m339,PENDEJO BOB,"Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours."
176630,L193726,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Which way?
176631,L193725,u5118,m339,PENDEJO BOB,Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
176632,L193724,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Looking to get out.
176633,L193723,u5118,m339,PENDEJO BOB,What're you doing in here?
176634,L193874,u5119,m339,PIPELINE,Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
176635,L193873,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Who?
176636,L193872,u5119,m339,PIPELINE,"You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up."
176637,L193870,u5119,m339,PIPELINE,"Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man."
176638,L193869,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Where?
176639,L193868,u5119,m339,PIPELINE,"Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake."
176640,L193867,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
176641,L193866,u5119,m339,PIPELINE,Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
176642,L193657,u5119,m339,PIPELINE,Down that way.
176643,L193656,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
176644,L193655,u5119,m339,PIPELINE,"Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake."
176645,L193759,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Who?
176646,L193758,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,"Run, Snake...They're coming."
176647,L193757,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,"No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte."
176648,L193756,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Find Cuervo Jones.
176649,L193755,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,What are you gonna do in Venice?
176650,L193754,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,"It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep."
176651,L193753,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
176652,L193752,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,The freeway.
176653,L193751,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,What the hell is this?
176654,L193750,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,"I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going."
176655,L193738,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,"I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave."
176656,L193737,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,"Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?"
176657,L193722,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
176658,L193721,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,Snake - what is it?
176659,L193719,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,Sewers. Come on.
176660,L193718,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,How do we get out of here?
176661,L193716,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,The what?
176662,L193715,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
176663,L193713,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
176664,L193712,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
176665,L193710,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Like hell I do.
176666,L193709,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,You need help.
176667,L193708,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Don't follow me.
176668,L193702,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
176669,L193701,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Who?
176670,L193700,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,"Oh no, it's the Doctor."
176671,L193699,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,No screamin' shit.
176672,L193698,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,"They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive."
176673,L193697,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,What are they?
176674,L193694,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,"A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake."
176675,L193693,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Are you crazy?
176676,L193692,u5123,m339,TASLIMA,"Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours."
176677,L194029,u5121,m339,PRESIDENT,Give me the prototype.
176678,L194028,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Where's the anti-toxin...?
176679,L194003,u5121,m339,PRESIDENT,Thank God.
176680,L194002,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,"Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in."
176681,L193594,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,I've been doin' that all my life. Might as well do it in L.A. Everybody else there is.
176682,L193593,u5121,m339,PRESIDENT,You're running out of time.
176683,L193592,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,"Well, I'll think it over."
176684,L193591,u5121,m339,PRESIDENT,Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
176685,L193590,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
176686,L193946,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
176687,L193945,u5122,m339,SPINAL,Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
176688,L193944,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
176689,L193939,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Yeah.
176690,L193938,u5122,m339,SPINAL,All of us?
176691,L193912,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
176692,L193911,u5122,m339,SPINAL,"Hershe, you were in Cleveland?"
176693,L193910,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
176694,L193666,u5122,m339,SPINAL,Who ain't?
176695,L193665,u5120,m339,PLISSKEN,I'm looking for somebody.
176696,L193664,u5122,m339,SPINAL,"Hey, what's going down, Snake?"
176697,L197359,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
176698,L197358,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,"My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--"
176699,L197357,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,...I saw nothing.
176700,L197356,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"When you threw it in, what did you see?"
176701,L197353,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,--Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.
176702,L197352,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,I cannot--
176703,L197351,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you."
176704,L197150,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,...Perceval!
176705,L197149,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir..."
176706,L197143,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
176707,L197142,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Is he coming?
176708,L197342,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty..."
176709,L197341,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--"
176710,L197340,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
176711,L197339,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die."
176712,L197338,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,Arthur.
176713,L197170,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,It is deep...
176714,L197169,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
176715,L197162,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
176716,L197161,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
176717,L197035,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing."
176718,L197034,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me."
176719,L197032,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me."
176720,L197031,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift."
176721,L197011,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights..."
176722,L197010,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?"
176723,L197007,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion."
176724,L197006,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it."
176725,L197005,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,I gave up my castles and my lands!
176726,L197004,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,But your life and lands are far from here.
176727,L197003,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
176728,L197002,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson."
176729,L197001,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King."
176730,L197000,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Thanks to God, you are alive."
176731,L196991,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must."
176732,L196990,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"So be it, to the death."
176733,L196989,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around."
176734,L196988,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"I sought only not to harm you, sir."
176735,L196987,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me."
176736,L196986,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,I will not.
176737,L196985,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,Yield. I have the advantage.
176738,L196981,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God."
176739,L196980,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Move aside!
176740,L196979,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel."
176741,L196978,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
176742,L196977,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service."
176743,L196976,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?"
176744,L196975,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
176745,L196974,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own."
176746,L196973,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"Good day to you, sir."
176747,L197332,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
176748,L197331,u5128,m340,KAY,He can be no other.
176749,L197309,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there."
176750,L197308,u5128,m340,KAY,Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
176751,L197307,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Of Merlin?
176752,L197306,u5128,m340,KAY,"Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming..."
176753,L197280,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule."
176754,L197279,u5128,m340,KAY,"Perceval, you have returned!"
176755,L197252,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must."
176756,L197251,u5128,m340,KAY,Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
176757,L197250,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,At last...
176758,L197304,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!"
176759,L197303,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams..."
176760,L197302,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
176761,L197301,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"But, I'm here."
176762,L197300,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece."
176763,L197299,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"What is this place, Merlin?"
176764,L197298,u5130,m340,MERLIN,I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
176765,L197297,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives."
176766,L197186,u5130,m340,MERLIN,I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
176767,L197185,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?"
176768,L197184,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king..."
176769,L197183,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
176770,L197182,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself."
176771,L197181,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at..."
176772,L197180,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too..."
176773,L197179,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister..."
176774,L197166,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
176775,L197165,u5130,m340,MERLIN,What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
176776,L197159,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here."
176777,L197158,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me."
176778,L197157,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Yes.
176779,L197155,u5130,m340,MERLIN,What is it my child?
176780,L197154,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me..."
176781,L197111,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"Never where you expect it, that's all I know."
176782,L197110,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?"
176783,L197109,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
176784,L197108,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?"
176785,L197107,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"At your service, sir."
176786,L197040,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,...to ride out and meet them.
176787,L197039,u5130,m340,MERLIN,The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
176788,L196998,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!"
176789,L196997,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Excalibur! Is it true?
176790,L196972,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge."
176791,L196971,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
176792,L196970,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
176793,L196969,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today."
176794,L196968,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,I should have left you to fend for yourself.
176795,L196958,u5130,m340,MERLIN,You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
176796,L196957,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Guenevere...
176797,L196956,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
176798,L196955,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then."
176799,L196954,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it."
176800,L196953,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered."
176801,L196952,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,...of course...
176802,L196951,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"A king must marry, after all."
176803,L196931,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"What's this, what's this?!"
176804,L196930,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
176805,L196912,u5130,m340,MERLIN,The dragon! There...
176806,L196911,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,What?!
176807,L196910,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders."
176808,L196909,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,What book is that?
176809,L196908,u5130,m340,MERLIN,In the great book.
176810,L196907,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,How? Where?
176811,L196904,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
176812,L196903,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--"
176813,L196902,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Thank you.
176814,L196901,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired..."
176815,L196900,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
176816,L196899,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him."
176817,L196898,u5130,m340,MERLIN,It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
176818,L196896,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up."
176819,L196895,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--"
176820,L196894,u5130,m340,MERLIN,That's not why you came.
176821,L196893,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,I want to thank you.
176822,L196892,u5130,m340,MERLIN,But not from your destiny.
176823,L196891,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,You saved me from the arrow...
176824,L196883,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur."
176825,L196882,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Whose son am I?
176826,L196880,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Speak of the devil!...
176827,L196879,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Who is Merlin?
176828,L197264,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,So be it.
176829,L197263,u5131,m340,MORDRED,"I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine."
176830,L197261,u5131,m340,MORDRED,"And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king."
176831,L197260,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I cannot offer you the land, only my love..."
176832,L197259,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Your mother told you that?
176833,L197258,u5131,m340,MORDRED,The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
176834,L197257,u5131,m340,MORDRED,"And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There."
176835,L197256,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I recognize you only as my son, no more."
176836,L197255,u5131,m340,MORDRED,"I have come to claim what is mine, Father."
176837,L197254,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Rise, Mordred."
176838,L197253,u5131,m340,MORDRED,Father...
176839,L196965,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go."
176840,L196964,u5134,m340,SIR ECTOR,He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
176841,L196878,u5134,m340,SIR ECTOR,"I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you."
176842,L196877,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Who is, then?"
176843,L196867,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness."
176844,L196866,u5134,m340,SIR ECTOR,"You freed it, son?"
176845,L196865,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it."
176846,L196853,u5134,m340,SIR ECTOR,"Well hurry then, and get it."
176847,L196852,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I left it in the tent, sir."
176848,L197286,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,I have kept it.
176849,L197285,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be."
176850,L197284,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,"I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky."
176851,L197140,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,"And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?"
176852,L197139,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come..."
176853,L197138,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,And you cannot love me...
176854,L197137,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband."
176855,L197136,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,Why can't you be my champion?
176856,L197125,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,"Not you, my husband?"
176857,L197124,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
176858,L197118,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,"No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness."
176859,L197117,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen."
176860,L197043,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Without Lancelot?!
176861,L197042,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,Don't start a war on my wedding day!
176862,L197041,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here."
176863,L197037,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers.
176864,L197036,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,"He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself."
176865,L196947,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,"Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too."
176866,L196946,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,I'm going.
176867,L196945,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,"No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week."
176868,L196944,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,"Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles."
176869,L196943,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
176870,L196942,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
176871,L196941,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,"But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores..."
176872,L196939,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
176873,L196938,u5125,m340,ARTHUR,Ye...
176874,L196937,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,"It didn't hurt too much, did it?"
176875,L197275,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
176876,L197274,u5126,m340,FIGURE,I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
176877,L197273,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,Because you and the land are one.
176878,L197272,u5126,m340,FIGURE,"I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?"
176879,L197271,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,"You, my lord."
176880,L197270,u5126,m340,FIGURE,Who does it serve?
176881,L197195,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,We are to blame.
176882,L197194,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"The King without his sword, the land without a king..."
176883,L197193,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,He has given up.
176884,L197192,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,Why didn't he kill us?
176885,L197176,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,--Nothing!
176886,L197175,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,There are things about love--
176887,L197174,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,Love demands it.
176888,L197173,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,The law forbids it.
176889,L197057,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman."
176890,L197056,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,To me? But why?
176891,L197055,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,Yes. I would swear my love to you.
176892,L197054,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,Me?
176893,L197053,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,You.
176894,L197052,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,Who?!
176895,L197051,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,There is one.
176896,L197050,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
176897,L197049,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
176898,L197048,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,Why?
176899,L197047,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,No.
176900,L197046,u5127,m340,GUENEVERE,The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
176901,L197135,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection."
176902,L197134,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
176903,L197084,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,Twenty days!? The world is that big?
176904,L197083,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,"Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here."
176905,L197082,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,I will run.
176906,L197081,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,Very well. Climb up.
176907,L197077,u5133,m340,PERCEVAL,You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
176908,L197076,u5129,m340,LANCELOT,Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
176909,L197319,u5132,m340,MORGANA,"--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping..."
176910,L197318,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight."
176911,L197317,u5132,m340,MORGANA,"I am the desert, where water disappears--"
176912,L197316,u5130,m340,MERLIN,I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
176913,L197312,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake."
176914,L197311,u5132,m340,MORGANA,"You provoke me, Merlin."
176915,L197209,u5132,m340,MORGANA,"Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man..."
176916,L197208,u5130,m340,MERLIN,What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
176917,L197206,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you."
176918,L197205,u5132,m340,MORGANA,"Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!"
176919,L197204,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings..."
176920,L197203,u5132,m340,MORGANA,You are truly magnificent!
176921,L197199,u5132,m340,MORGANA,Why?
176922,L197198,u5130,m340,MERLIN,They do.
176923,L197197,u5132,m340,MORGANA,People make you laugh?
176924,L197196,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me."
176925,L197190,u5130,m340,MERLIN,That I cannot.
176926,L197189,u5132,m340,MORGANA,"You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world."
176927,L197105,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Maybe... maybe...
176928,L197104,u5132,m340,MORGANA,"The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas..."
176929,L197103,u5130,m340,MERLIN,I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
176930,L197101,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana."
176931,L197100,u5132,m340,MORGANA,A lovestruck page!
176932,L197099,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name..."
176933,L197098,u5132,m340,MORGANA,"It's clear you are, and it irks me."
176934,L197097,u5130,m340,MERLIN,I'm not jealous!
176935,L197096,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"No, no, of course not. You are young..."
176936,L197067,u5132,m340,MORGANA,Can it truly be used for magic?
176937,L197066,u5130,m340,MERLIN,It is.
176938,L197065,u5132,m340,MORGANA,"Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?"
176939,L197064,u5130,m340,MERLIN,You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
176940,L196838,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent."
176941,L196837,u5135,m340,UTHER,You strike me with words as hard as steel.
176942,L196836,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king..."
176943,L196835,u5135,m340,UTHER,"To kill and be king, is that all?"
176944,L196834,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child."
176945,L196830,u5130,m340,MERLIN,You didn't ask!
176946,L196829,u5135,m340,UTHER,The oath. You didn't say--
176947,L196828,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him."
176948,L196827,u5135,m340,UTHER,I?
176949,L196826,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Now you must pay me.
176950,L196825,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength."
176951,L196824,u5135,m340,UTHER,Merlin! Out of the sick sleep at last.
176952,L196788,u5135,m340,UTHER,I swear it.
176953,L196787,u5130,m340,MERLIN,--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
176954,L196786,u5135,m340,UTHER,I swear it. By Excalibur and the holy--
176955,L196782,u5135,m340,UTHER,"Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King."
176956,L196781,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when."
176957,L196761,u5135,m340,UTHER,"One land, one king! That is my peace!"
176958,L196760,u5130,m340,MERLIN,"Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words."
176959,L196759,u5130,m340,MERLIN,Just show the sword.
176960,L196758,u5135,m340,UTHER,"I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?"
176961,L196756,u5135,m340,UTHER,Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
176962,L196755,u5130,m340,MERLIN,It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
176963,L197639,u5136,m341,BURKE,Fuck it.
176964,L197638,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What honey?
176965,L197406,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Hiding?
176966,L197405,u5136,m341,BURKE,Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
176967,L197404,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Well why are they tearing the building down?
176968,L197403,u5136,m341,BURKE,Well what's wrong?
176969,L197402,u5138,m341,CHRIS,C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
176970,L197401,u5136,m341,BURKE,"Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down."
176971,L197400,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
176972,L198082,u5149,m341,PRESIDENT,"Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him."
176973,L198081,u5137,m341,CARDINAL,I didn't know that.
176974,L198080,u5149,m341,PRESIDENT,"It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience."
176975,L198079,u5137,m341,CARDINAL,"Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?"
176976,L198078,u5149,m341,PRESIDENT,"No, he's working on another book."
176977,L198077,u5137,m341,CARDINAL,What's he doing there? Teaching?
176978,L198076,u5149,m341,PRESIDENT,"That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now."
176979,L198075,u5137,m341,CARDINAL,Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
176980,L198074,u5149,m341,PRESIDENT,How about Lankaster Merrin.
176981,L198073,u5137,m341,CARDINAL,And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
176982,L198072,u5149,m341,PRESIDENT,"Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway."
176983,L198071,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Thank you your excellency.
176984,L198070,u5137,m341,CARDINAL,Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
176985,L198069,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"I see, your excellency."
176986,L198068,u5137,m341,CARDINAL,It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
176987,L198067,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Yes.
176988,L198066,u5137,m341,CARDINAL,You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
176989,L198065,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual."
176990,L198064,u5137,m341,CARDINAL,You're convinced that it's genuine.
176991,L197857,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?"
176992,L197856,u5139,m341,CLINIC DIRECTOR,"It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear."
176993,L197849,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit..."
176994,L197848,u5139,m341,CLINIC DIRECTOR,I'm sorry.
176995,L197847,u5138,m341,CHRIS,And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
176996,L197846,u5139,m341,CLINIC DIRECTOR,It's-
176997,L197845,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!"
176998,L197844,u5139,m341,CLINIC DIRECTOR,"Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will."
176999,L198198,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Sure you won't change your mind?
177000,L198197,u5153,m341,SHARON,Me too.

177013,L197752,u5153,m341,SHARON,"Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better."
177014,L197751,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What's Burke got to do with it?
177015,L197750,u5153,m341,SHARON,Burke.

177021,L197552,u5153,m341,SHARON,Maybe the circuit is busy?
177022,L197551,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake."
177023,L197433,u5138,m341,CHRIS,No kidding.
177024,L197432,u5153,m341,SHARON,Just five or six people.

177026,L197430,u5153,m341,SHARON,Dinner at the White House.
177027,L197429,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What's this?
177028,L197428,u5153,m341,SHARON,And you got an invitation.
177029,L197427,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Oh great, anything else?"

177031,L197424,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific."

177037,L197904,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Thank you.
177038,L197902,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Really? wow.
177039,L197901,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times."
177040,L197900,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What's her name?
177041,L197899,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Oh, she'd love it."
177042,L197898,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Of course. Have you got a pen?
177043,L197897,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
177044,L197896,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
177045,L197895,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"When she's well enough, I'll ask."
177046,L197894,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked ""What's this fungus?"" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?"
177047,L197893,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place."
177048,L197892,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?"
177049,L197889,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Please.
177050,L197888,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Would you like some more coffee?
177051,L197887,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Never mind.
177052,L197886,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Want to ask him?
177053,L197885,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Oh, I see."
177054,L197884,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that."
177055,L197883,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Groceries maybe? A package?
177056,L197882,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Not that I know of.
177057,L197881,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,You were expecting a deliver y that day?
177058,L197880,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"No. Not at all,"
177059,L197879,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?"
177060,L197875,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Watch out for drafts. A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
177061,L197874,u5138,m341,CHRIS,We still don't know.
177062,L197873,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,May I ask...?
177063,L197872,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Yes, I'm affraid it is."
177064,L197871,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,It's serious?
177065,L197870,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"No, she was heavily sedated."
177066,L197869,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
177067,L197877,u5138,m341,CHRIS,No thanks Karl.
177068,L197876,u5143,m341,KARL,Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
177069,L197868,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What man?
177070,L197867,u5143,m341,KARL,A man to see you.
177071,L197866,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What!
177072,L197865,u5143,m341,KARL,Excuse me Miss?
177073,L197861,u5143,m341,KARL,No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
177074,L197860,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?"
177075,L197859,u5143,m341,KARL,She is going to be well?
177076,L197858,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Karl? Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
177077,L197633,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Karl!!
177078,L197632,u5143,m341,KARL,Bastard! I will kill you.
177079,L197563,u5138,m341,CHRIS,No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
177080,L197562,u5143,m341,KARL,"Very sorry, but you see, no rats!"
177081,L197561,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that."
177082,L197560,u5143,m341,KARL,There is nothing.
177083,L197394,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
177084,L197393,u5143,m341,KARL,"Yes, I go now."
177085,L197392,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
177086,L197390,u5138,m341,CHRIS,I just heard them Karl.
177087,L197389,u5143,m341,KARL,No. No rats.
177088,L197388,u5138,m341,CHRIS,All right then we've got clean rats.
177089,L197387,u5143,m341,KARL,But it's clean?
177090,L197386,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
177091,L197385,u5143,m341,KARL,Rats?
177092,L197384,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps."
177093,L197383,u5143,m341,KARL,Good morning Madame.
177094,L197655,u5155,m341,WILLIE,"Yes, I think so."
177095,L197654,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Is it coming out Willie?
177096,L197381,u5138,m341,CHRIS,That's good.
177097,L197380,u5155,m341,WILLIE,Fine thank you.
177098,L197379,u5138,m341,CHRIS,How are you today?
177099,L197378,u5155,m341,WILLIE,Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
177100,L197377,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Morning.
177101,L197741,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
177102,L197740,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?"
177103,L197739,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean."
177104,L197738,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass."
177105,L197737,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,Are you sure?
177106,L197736,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"No. Of course not, nothing like that."
177107,L197735,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,Do you keep any drugs in your house?
177108,L197728,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
177109,L197727,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,We still think the temporal lobe...
177110,L197724,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?"
177111,L197723,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
177112,L197687,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
177113,L197686,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
177114,L197685,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour."
177115,L197684,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change."
177116,L197683,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder."
177117,L197682,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"So, what causes this?"
177118,L197681,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain."
177119,L197680,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!"
177120,L197679,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms."
177121,L197678,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Convulsion?
177122,L197677,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion."
177123,L197613,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
177124,L197612,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?"
177125,L197611,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying."
177126,L197610,u5138,m341,CHRIS,She used those words?
177127,L197609,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt."
177128,L197608,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor."
177129,L197607,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!"
177130,L197606,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive."
177131,L197605,u5138,m341,CHRIS,You're kidding! Like what?
177132,L197604,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil."
177133,L197603,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
177134,L197602,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-"
177135,L197601,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Never.
177136,L197600,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
177137,L197599,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff."
177138,L197598,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,Lies?
177139,L197597,u5138,m341,CHRIS,And those lies she's been telling?
177140,L197596,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
177141,L197595,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
177142,L197594,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce."
177143,L197593,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Depression?
177144,L197592,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field."
177145,L197591,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
177146,L197590,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,A stimulant.
177147,L197589,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What is it? A tranquilizer?
177148,L197588,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
177149,L197587,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,It affects concentration.
177150,L197586,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Why the math?
177151,L197585,u5140,m341,DR. KLEIN,"A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math."
177152,L198184,u5144,m341,KARRAS,No.
177153,L198183,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Is she gonna die?
177154,L198089,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Father?
177155,L198088,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Yes. He's already here.
177156,L198051,u5138,m341,CHRIS,She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
177157,L198050,u5144,m341,KARRAS,What?
177158,L198049,u5138,m341,CHRIS,She...killed Burke Dennings.
177159,L198048,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
177160,L198047,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What's the difference?
177161,L198046,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water."
177162,L198045,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Well I think you should.
177163,L198044,u5138,m341,CHRIS,No
177164,L198043,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Have you told him what's happening?
177165,L198042,u5138,m341,CHRIS,In Europe.

177172,L198033,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Wanna drink.
177173,L198001,u5144,m341,KARRAS,It's not important good night.
177174,L198000,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Not at all. Why d'you ask?
177175,L197999,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"No, is Regan aware of it?"
177176,L197998,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Yes I did, I'm sorry."
177177,L197997,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Did you know my mother died recently?
177178,L197996,u5138,m341,CHRIS,No.
177179,L197995,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
177180,L197994,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!"
177181,L197993,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find."
177182,L197992,u5138,m341,CHRIS,I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
177183,L197991,u5144,m341,KARRAS,I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
177184,L197990,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What else?
177185,L197989,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
177186,L197988,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Like what?
177187,L197987,u5144,m341,KARRAS,I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
177188,L197986,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
177189,L197985,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good."

177191,L197967,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"No, you don't understand. Your daughter-"
177192,L197966,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!"

177195,L197963,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-"
177196,L197962,u5138,m341,CHRIS,You could do it yourself...
177197,L197961,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime..."
177198,L197960,u5138,m341,CHRIS,But how?
177199,L197959,u5144,m341,KARRAS,To begin with it could make things worse.
177200,L197958,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Why, I don't understand?"
177201,L197957,u5144,m341,KARRAS,That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
177202,L197955,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist."
177203,L197954,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one."

177205,L197952,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
177206,L197951,u5138,m341,CHRIS,I didn't get you?
177207,L197950,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century."
177208,L197949,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?"

177210,L197947,u5138,m341,CHRIS,And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
177211,L197946,u5144,m341,KARRAS,No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
177212,L197945,u5138,m341,CHRIS,You wouldn't.
177213,L197944,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no."

177215,L197942,u5144,m341,KARRAS,The priest.
177216,L197941,u5138,m341,CHRIS,On what?
177217,L197940,u5144,m341,KARRAS,That depends.
177218,L197939,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?

177233,L197924,u5144,m341,KARRAS,It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
177234,L197923,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?"

177324,L197440,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?"
177325,L197439,u5151,m341,REGAN,"Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?"
177326,L197438,u5151,m341,REGAN,"Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river."
177327,L197437,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What kind of stuff?
177328,L197436,u5151,m341,REGAN,Um........Stuff.
177329,L197435,u5138,m341,CHRIS,What did you do today?
177330,L198210,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,Okay.
177331,L198209,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Goodbye Father. I call you.
177332,L198203,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,That's good.
177333,L198202,u5138,m341,CHRIS,She doesn't remeber a thing.
177334,L197642,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,"Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me."
177335,L197641,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Yeah, don't stop. Keep going."
177336,L197640,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,Hi Chris. Great party.
177337,L197630,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,"That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her."
177338,L197629,u5138,m341,CHRIS,Karras.
177339,L197628,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,Damien Karras.
177340,L197627,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?"
177341,L197626,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,St. Mike's.
177342,L197625,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?"
177343,L197733,u5141,m341,DR. TANNEY,"What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities."
177344,L197732,u5138,m341,CHRIS,"Oh, Christ."
177345,L197731,u5141,m341,DR. TANNEY,"A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal."
177346,L197730,u5138,m341,CHRIS,So what's next?
177347,L197729,u5141,m341,DR. TANNEY,"There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first."
177348,L197726,u5138,m341,CHRIS,So what's wrong with her?
177349,L197725,u5141,m341,DR. TANNEY,"Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean."
177350,L197671,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Stealing is a sin.
177351,L197670,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,Goodnight Dims.
177352,L197669,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,"No, I tell fortunes by reading the crease, now shut up and go to sleep."
177353,L197668,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
177354,L197667,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,Think you can sleep?
177355,L197666,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
177356,L197665,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there."
177357,L197664,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,"College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation."
177358,L197663,u5144,m341,KARRAS,I believe you.
177359,L197662,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,I stole it.
177360,L197661,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Where'd you get it then?
177361,L197660,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,"That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty."
177362,L197659,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
177363,L198234,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,No.
177364,L198233,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Another one. Had your lunch?
177365,L198232,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,I've seen it.
177366,L198231,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball."
177367,L198230,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,Who's in it?
177368,L198229,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Withering Heights.
177369,L198228,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,What's playing.
177370,L198227,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
177371,L198226,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,Sure.
177372,L198225,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Do you like films?
177373,L198223,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,Good bye.
177374,L198222,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father."
177375,L198221,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,She seemed fine.
177376,L198220,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,How's the girl?
177377,L198219,u5142,m341,FATHER DYER,You just missed them.
177378,L198218,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,I came to say goodbye.

177390,L198023,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
177391,L198022,u5144,m341,KARRAS,How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
177392,L198021,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,La plume de ma tante.
177393,L198020,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Quod nomen mihi est?

177395,L198018,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Quod nomen mihi est?
177396,L198017,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,Ego te abslovo.
177397,L198016,u5144,m341,KARRAS,You speak Latin?
177398,L198015,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,"In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?"
177399,L198014,u5144,m341,KARRAS,No now.
177400,L198013,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,In time.
177401,L198012,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Do it again.
177402,L198011,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,Uh Huh.
177403,L198010,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Did you do that?
177404,L198009,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,You and us.
177405,L198008,u5144,m341,KARRAS,You and Regan?
177406,L198007,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,It would bring us together.
177407,L198006,u5144,m341,KARRAS,But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
177408,L198005,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,Intensely.
177409,L198004,u5144,m341,KARRAS,You'd like that?
177410,L198003,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,What an excellent day for an exorcism.
177411,L198002,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said ""Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body."" When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said ""Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith""."
177412,L197983,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?"
177413,L197982,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,"Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it."
177414,L197980,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
177415,L197979,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,In here. With us.
177416,L197978,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Where's Regan?
177417,L197977,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
177418,L197976,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?"
177419,L197975,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
177420,L197974,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras."
177421,L197973,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,I'm not Regan.
177422,L197972,u5144,m341,KARRAS,I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
177423,L197971,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,You might loosen the straps then.
177424,L197970,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you."
177425,L197475,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am."
177426,L197474,u5147,m341,MRS.KARRAS,You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
177427,L197473,u5144,m341,KARRAS,No momma.
177428,L197472,u5147,m341,MRS.KARRAS,"Dimmy, you worry for something?"
177429,L197470,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Momma I can take you somewhere to a place where you wouldn't be alone. There'd be people around, you know you won't have to sit here listening to the radio."
177430,L197469,u5147,m341,MRS.KARRAS,Okay
177431,L197468,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest."
177432,L197467,u5147,m341,MRS.KARRAS,No.
177433,L197466,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Is that too tight?
177434,L197465,u5147,m341,MRS.KARRAS,Last month.
177435,L197464,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Oh really, when?"
177436,L197463,u5147,m341,MRS.KARRAS,Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
177437,L197460,u5144,m341,KARRAS,How's your leg?
177438,L197459,u5147,m341,MRS.KARRAS,I'm all right.
177439,L198176,u5146,m341,MERRIN,Don't listen.
177440,L198175,u5144,m341,KARRAS,You're not my mother!!!
177441,L198174,u5144,m341,KARRAS,She'll go into coma.
177442,L198173,u5146,m341,MERRIN,Can you give her something?
177443,L198172,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Her heart.
177444,L198171,u5146,m341,MERRIN,What is it?
177445,L198165,u5146,m341,MERRIN,I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
177446,L198164,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Why this girl it makes no sense?
177447,L198149,u5146,m341,MERRIN,"... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil."
177448,L198148,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Shut up!!
177449,L198145,u5146,m341,MERRIN,Defender of the human race...

177453,L198132,u5144,m341,KARRAS,And let my cry come unto thee.
177454,L198131,u5146,m341,MERRIN,See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
177455,L198130,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Amen
177456,L198129,u5146,m341,MERRIN,...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
177457,L198126,u5144,m341,KARRAS,And let my cry come unto thee.
177458,L198125,u5146,m341,MERRIN,Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
177459,L198124,u5146,m341,MERRIN,O'Lord hear my preyer.

177461,L198122,u5146,m341,MERRIN,"...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever."
177462,L198120,u5146,m341,MERRIN,"Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion."
177463,L198119,u5144,m341,KARRAS,And also with you.
177464,L198118,u5146,m341,MERRIN,The Lord be with you.
177465,L198117,u5144,m341,KARRAS,And let my cry come unto thee.
177466,L198114,u5144,m341,KARRAS,And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
177467,L198113,u5146,m341,MERRIN,Let the enemy have no power over her.
177468,L198112,u5144,m341,KARRAS,In the face of the enemy.
177469,L198111,u5146,m341,MERRIN,Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
177470,L198110,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Who places her trust in thee, my God."
177471,L198109,u5146,m341,MERRIN,Save your servant
177472,L198108,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen."
177473,L198107,u5146,m341,MERRIN,"Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."
177474,L198106,u5144,m341,KARRAS,But deliver us from the evil one.
177475,L198105,u5146,m341,MERRIN,"Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation."
177476,L198101,u5146,m341,MERRIN,There's only one.
177477,L198100,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-"
177478,L198099,u5146,m341,MERRIN,"We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen."
177479,L198097,u5146,m341,MERRIN,Why?
177480,L198096,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?"
177481,L198095,u5146,m341,MERRIN,"I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin."
177482,L198094,u5144,m341,KARRAS,No.
177483,L197839,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"I could have you deported, you know that?"
177484,L197838,u5144,m341,KARRAS,The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
177485,L197837,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Who?
177486,L197836,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Alright. You know who I think really did it?
177487,L197835,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Answer the question, Father Paranoia."
177488,L197834,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Come on!
177489,L197833,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
177490,L197832,u5144,m341,KARRAS,I've seen it.
177491,L197831,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?"
177492,L197830,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Who's in it?
177493,L197829,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello."
177494,L197828,u5144,m341,KARRAS,That's to bad.
177495,L197827,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go."
177496,L197826,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Very much.
177497,L197825,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Hey, Father? You like movies?"
177498,L197824,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
177499,L197823,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"No, I mentioned it only in passing."
177500,L197822,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Is that a threat?
177501,L197821,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient."
177502,L197820,u5144,m341,KARRAS,No I probably wouldn't.
177503,L197819,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?"
177504,L197818,u5144,m341,KARRAS,I don't know anyone who fits the description.
177505,L197817,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that."
177506,L197816,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Sick priest, is that it?"
177507,L197815,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps."
177508,L197814,u5144,m341,KARRAS,You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
177509,L197813,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
177510,L197812,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Unlikely.
177511,L197811,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,It's possible. Possible however
177512,L197810,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
177513,L197809,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards."
177514,L197808,u5144,m341,KARRAS,"Yeah, a fall."
177515,L197807,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"And Dennings, you read how he died?"
177516,L197806,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
177517,L197805,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
177518,L197804,u5144,m341,KARRAS,From the psychiatric end.
177519,L197803,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Really?
177520,L197802,u5144,m341,KARRAS,I once did a paper on it
177521,L197801,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting."
177522,L197800,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Only what I read in the papers.
177523,L197799,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
177524,L197798,u5144,m341,KARRAS,I've seen him.
177525,L197797,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?"
177526,L197796,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,Always.
177527,L197795,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
177528,L197794,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?"
177529,L197793,u5144,m341,KARRAS,What's this about?
177530,L197792,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
177531,L197791,u5145,m341,KINDERMAN,"No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer."
177532,L197790,u5144,m341,KARRAS,Have we met?
177533,L198147,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!

177544,L198116,u5146,m341,MERRIN,O'Lord hear my prey.
177545,L198115,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,"Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!"

177547,L198102,u5152,m341,REGAN/DEMON,"Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!"
177548,L198093,u5146,m341,MERRIN,Are you tired?

177559,L197783,u5150,m341,PSYCHIATRIST,"If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?"
177560,L197782,u5151,m341,REGAN,I'm afraid.
177561,L197781,u5150,m341,PSYCHIATRIST,Why not?
177562,L197780,u5151,m341,REGAN,No.
177563,L197779,u5150,m341,PSYCHIATRIST,"If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?"
177564,L197778,u5151,m341,REGAN,I don't know.
177565,L197777,u5150,m341,PSYCHIATRIST,Is it Captain Howdy?

177582,L198480,u5157,m342,CHARLIE,"It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls."
177583,L198479,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself."
177584,L198478,u5157,m342,CHARLIE,So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
177585,L198477,u5161,m342,FRANK,So?

177605,L198515,u5158,m342,DONNA,We have some lotion.
177606,L198514,u5164,m342,JACK,Maybe next time.
177607,L198513,u5158,m342,DONNA,Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
177608,L198512,u5164,m342,JACK,Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
177609,L198511,u5158,m342,DONNA,Swimming trunks.
177610,L198510,u5164,m342,JACK,Trunks?

177612,L199555,u5161,m342,FRANK,Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
177613,L199554,u5158,m342,DONNA,Honey ...
177614,L199553,u5161,m342,FRANK,"You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?"

177619,L198504,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?"
177620,L198863,u5159,m342,DR. BEASLEY,"The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker."
177621,L198862,u5164,m342,JACK,I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
177622,L198861,u5159,m342,DR. BEASLEY,"Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing."
177623,L198860,u5164,m342,JACK,What do you do to him?
177624,L198859,u5159,m342,DR. BEASLEY,No bones.

177626,L198857,u5159,m342,DR. BEASLEY,"Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe."

177628,L198855,u5159,m342,DR. BEASLEY,"Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?"
177629,L198854,u5164,m342,JACK,Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
177630,L198853,u5159,m342,DR. BEASLEY,Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
177631,L198852,u5164,m342,JACK,How many?
177632,L198851,u5159,m342,DR. BEASLEY,They gotta go.
177633,L198850,u5159,m342,DR. BEASLEY,Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
177634,L198849,u5164,m342,JACK,They're falling out.
177635,L198848,u5159,m342,DR. BEASLEY,What's wrong with them?
177636,L198847,u5164,m342,JACK,Teeth.
177637,L198846,u5159,m342,DR. BEASLEY,What's our friend's problem?
177638,L198845,u5164,m342,JACK,Baker.

177644,L199480,u5164,m342,JACK,Get your hand off me.
177645,L199479,u5160,m342,EARL,"What do you say we go for a walk, pal."
177646,L199462,u5160,m342,EARL,"The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym."
177647,L199461,u5164,m342,JACK,Accident?
177648,L199460,u5160,m342,EARL,Knee.  Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right before the accident.
177649,L199459,u5164,m342,JACK,What's wrong with the kid?
177650,L199458,u5160,m342,EARL,Oh.
177651,L199457,u5164,m342,JACK,My brother and I. One each.
177652,L199456,u5160,m342,EARL,Two at a time?
177653,L199455,u5164,m342,JACK,Piano.
177654,L199454,u5160,m342,EARL,Oh.  What do you do?
177655,L199453,u5164,m342,JACK,No.
177656,L199452,u5160,m342,EARL,You the magician?
177657,L198432,u5161,m342,FRANK,Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
177658,L198431,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,"Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ..."
177659,L198430,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?"
177660,L198429,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,Oh no!
177661,L198428,u5161,m342,FRANK,"In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals."
177662,L198427,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
177663,L198426,u5161,m342,FRANK,Recognize these two characters?
177664,L198425,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,Oh my God ...
177665,L198404,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,"Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake."
177666,L198403,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack."
177667,L198402,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,"Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association."
177668,L198401,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Twenty years, Ma ..."
177669,L198400,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,I thought maybe held gotten over that.
177670,L198399,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack."
177671,L198396,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,"A little stiffer, but just as sturdy."
177672,L198395,u5161,m342,FRANK,How's the birthday girl?
177673,L198394,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,"Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!"
177674,L198359,u5175,m342,WILLIE,My pleasure.
177675,L198358,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks."
177676,L198353,u5161,m342,FRANK,Two nights.
177677,L198352,u5175,m342,WILLIE,What's the gig?
177678,L198348,u5175,m342,WILLIE,Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
177679,L198347,u5161,m342,FRANK,When they coming in?
177680,L198346,u5175,m342,WILLIE,Out.
177681,L198345,u5161,m342,FRANK,"What happened to the two Clays, Willie?"
177682,L199627,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:"
177683,L199626,u5164,m342,JACK,She asked for it.
177684,L199625,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare."
177685,L199624,u5164,m342,JACK,Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
177686,L199623,u5161,m342,FRANK,Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
177687,L199622,u5164,m342,JACK,Five years ago.  November.
177688,L199621,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?"
177689,L199620,u5164,m342,JACK,Yeah.
177690,L199619,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?"
177691,L199618,u5164,m342,JACK,Yeah?
177692,L199617,u5161,m342,FRANK,Charlie called.
177693,L199616,u5161,m342,FRANK,I can keep the beat.
177694,L199615,u5164,m342,JACK,"I mean, you can play.  You're okay."
177695,L199614,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yeah, I know.  Me, too."
177696,L199613,u5164,m342,JACK,"You know, that night, I ... It just all came up."
177697,L199612,u5161,m342,FRANK,Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
177698,L199611,u5164,m342,JACK,How're your hands?
177699,L199609,u5164,m342,JACK,This'll kill 'em.
177700,L199608,u5161,m342,FRANK,Looks like these got a few years on them.
177701,L199607,u5161,m342,FRANK,Good choice.
177702,L199606,u5164,m342,JACK,I'll take the Mallory.
177703,L199605,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory."
177704,L199600,u5164,m342,JACK,"Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot."
177705,L199599,u5161,m342,FRANK,"No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag."
177706,L199598,u5164,m342,JACK,Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
177707,L199597,u5161,m342,FRANK,No.
177708,L199596,u5164,m342,JACK,Go ahead.
177709,L199591,u5164,m342,JACK,Sure.
177710,L199590,u5161,m342,FRANK,There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
177711,L199589,u5164,m342,JACK,"Yeah, fine."
177712,L199588,u5161,m342,FRANK,I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
177713,L199587,u5164,m342,JACK,Right.
177714,L199586,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it."
177715,L199585,u5164,m342,JACK,"Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean."
177716,L199584,u5164,m342,JACK,Later.
177717,L199583,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started."
177718,L199582,u5161,m342,FRANK,Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
177719,L199581,u5164,m342,JACK,What're you doing?
177720,L199580,u5161,m342,FRANK,I didn't hear you come in.
177721,L199515,u5164,m342,JACK,"Who's weak now, big brother?"
177722,L199514,u5161,m342,FRANK,Jack!
177723,L199508,u5161,m342,FRANK,"No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you."
177724,L199507,u5164,m342,JACK,Fuck you.
177725,L199506,u5161,m342,FRANK,That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
177726,L199505,u5164,m342,JACK,You weren't there.
177727,L199504,u5161,m342,FRANK,"No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool."
177728,L199503,u5164,m342,JACK,Stay off it.
177729,L199497,u5161,m342,FRANK,Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
177730,L199496,u5164,m342,JACK,"What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?"
177731,L199495,u5161,m342,FRANK,"It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt."
177732,L199494,u5164,m342,JACK,What?
177733,L199493,u5161,m342,FRANK,I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
177734,L199492,u5164,m342,JACK,"Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs."
177735,L199491,u5161,m342,FRANK,Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
177736,L199490,u5164,m342,JACK,"What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?"
177737,L199478,u5164,m342,JACK,"Shut up, Frank."
177738,L199477,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Jack, you're on television."
177739,L199467,u5161,m342,FRANK,What?
177740,L199466,u5164,m342,JACK,We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
177741,L199465,u5161,m342,FRANK,What?
177742,L199464,u5164,m342,JACK,Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
177743,L199463,u5161,m342,FRANK,We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
177744,L199446,u5161,m342,FRANK,"A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?"
177745,L199445,u5164,m342,JACK,Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
177746,L199444,u5161,m342,FRANK,Seventy-one
177747,L199443,u5164,m342,JACK,What channels it on?
177748,L199442,u5161,m342,FRANK,"It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision."
177749,L199441,u5164,m342,JACK,You don't know?
177750,L199440,u5161,m342,FRANK,I don't know.
177751,L199439,u5164,m342,JACK,What disease?
177752,L199438,u5161,m342,FRANK,I don't know. Some disease.
177753,L199437,u5164,m342,JACK,What's it for?
177754,L199436,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent."
177755,L199435,u5164,m342,JACK,Nothing. We get nothing.
177756,L199434,u5161,m342,FRANK,No.
177757,L199433,u5164,m342,JACK,We're not getting paid then.
177758,L199391,u5164,m342,JACK,Twenty-eight years.
177759,L199390,u5161,m342,FRANK,"You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?"
177760,L199382,u5164,m342,JACK,Better give her pneumonia.
177761,L199381,u5161,m342,FRANK,"You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack."
177762,L199380,u5164,m342,JACK,"Cancel, Frank."
177763,L199379,u5161,m342,FRANK,Just until we find another girl.
177764,L199378,u5164,m342,JACK,What're you doing?
177765,L199270,u5164,m342,JACK,"I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?"
177766,L199269,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Be reasonable, Jack."
177767,L199268,u5164,m342,JACK,I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
177768,L199267,u5161,m342,FRANK,What do you mean?
177769,L199266,u5164,m342,JACK,I can't make the tenth.
177770,L199265,u5161,m342,FRANK,What?
177771,L199264,u5164,m342,JACK,The tenth's out.
177772,L199263,u5161,m342,FRANK,"That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri."
177773,L199250,u5161,m342,FRANK,Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
177774,L199249,u5164,m342,JACK,"You're making things up, Frank."
177775,L199248,u5161,m342,FRANK,I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
177776,L199247,u5164,m342,JACK,You could've come.
177777,L199246,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together."
177778,L199245,u5164,m342,JACK,"It was just a can of beer, Frank."
177779,L199244,u5161,m342,FRANK,"It was like you'd passed some test, you know?"
177780,L199243,u5164,m342,JACK,He was just having fun.
177781,L199242,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you."
177782,L199241,u5164,m342,JACK,You always threw up.
177783,L199240,u5161,m342,FRANK,I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
177784,L199239,u5164,m342,JACK,Yeah.
177785,L199238,u5161,m342,FRANK,"God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?"
177786,L199237,u5164,m342,JACK,I told you.  It's a useless talent.
177787,L199236,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?"
177788,L199235,u5164,m342,JACK,They were simple songs.
177789,L199234,u5161,m342,FRANK,Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
177790,L199233,u5164,m342,JACK,A useless talent.
177791,L199232,u5161,m342,FRANK,Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
177792,L199231,u5164,m342,JACK,April.
177793,L199230,u5161,m342,FRANK,February?
177794,L199229,u5164,m342,JACK,Couple years.
177795,L199228,u5161,m342,FRANK,Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
177796,L199227,u5164,m342,JACK,The Royal.
177797,L199224,u5161,m342,FRANK,"A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business."
177798,L199223,u5164,m342,JACK,Expensive hangover.
177799,L199222,u5161,m342,FRANK,"No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done."
177800,L199221,u5164,m342,JACK,The party's over.
177801,L199220,u5161,m342,FRANK,Celebrating.  Join me?
177802,L199219,u5164,m342,JACK,What're you doing down here?
177803,L199202,u5164,m342,JACK,"You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me."
177804,L199201,u5161,m342,FRANK,How come I didn't hear anything?
177805,L199200,u5164,m342,JACK,He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
177806,L199199,u5161,m342,FRANK,He was wearing a suit.
177807,L199198,u5164,m342,JACK,We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
177808,L199197,u5161,m342,FRANK,What are you talking about?
177809,L199196,u5164,m342,JACK,He's with the hotel.  I called him.
177810,L199195,u5161,m342,FRANK,Huh?
177811,L199194,u5164,m342,JACK,You saw wrong.
177812,L199191,u5161,m342,FRANK,We were just having a little discussion about morality.
177813,L199190,u5164,m342,JACK,What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
177814,L199170,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?"
177815,L199169,u5164,m342,JACK,What?
177816,L199168,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Funny, huh?"
177817,L199158,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie."
177818,L199157,u5164,m342,JACK,What the hell are these?
177819,L199156,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?"
177820,L199155,u5164,m342,JACK,She's a big girl.
177821,L199154,u5161,m342,FRANK,Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
177822,L199153,u5164,m342,JACK,No. Why?
177823,L199152,u5161,m342,FRANK,"You haven't seen Susie, have you?"
177824,L199149,u5164,m342,JACK,"Time flies, huh?"
177825,L199148,u5161,m342,FRANK,Two hours ago!
177826,L199147,u5164,m342,JACK,They stopped serving two hours ago.
177827,L199146,u5161,m342,FRANK,Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
177828,L199145,u5164,m342,JACK,How long you been at it?
177829,L199144,u5161,m342,FRANK,Fine.
177830,L199143,u5164,m342,JACK,How's it coming?
177831,L199142,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune."
177832,L199141,u5164,m342,JACK,Really.
177833,L199140,u5161,m342,FRANK,What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
177834,L199139,u5164,m342,JACK,What the hell are you doing?
177835,L199124,u5164,m342,JACK,It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
177836,L199123,u5161,m342,FRANK,How dare you say you love me.
177837,L199122,u5164,m342,JACK,"I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional."
177838,L199121,u5161,m342,FRANK,What's the matter with you?
177839,L199115,u5164,m342,JACK,I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
177840,L199114,u5161,m342,FRANK,What?
177841,L199113,u5164,m342,JACK,"Right.  I love you, Frank."
177842,L199112,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?"
177843,L199107,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?"
177844,L199106,u5164,m342,JACK,Because I can hear it.
177845,L199105,u5161,m342,FRANK,"What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?"
177846,L199104,u5164,m342,JACK,Doesn't it matter to you?
177847,L199103,u5161,m342,FRANK,No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
177848,L199102,u5164,m342,JACK,"Christ, can't you hear it?"
177849,L199101,u5161,m342,FRANK,What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
177850,L199100,u5164,m342,JACK,"No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old."
177851,L199099,u5161,m342,FRANK,Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
177852,L199097,u5164,m342,JACK,Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
177853,L199096,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --"
177854,L199095,u5164,m342,JACK,Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
177855,L199075,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?"
177856,L199074,u5164,m342,JACK,Why would I mind?
177857,L199073,u5161,m342,FRANK,Yeah.  You mind?
177858,L199072,u5164,m342,JACK,So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
177859,L199071,u5161,m342,FRANK,Yeah.
177860,L199070,u5164,m342,JACK,We're gonna be here a week?
177861,L199069,u5161,m342,FRANK,Yeah.
177862,L199068,u5164,m342,JACK,All night?
177863,L199067,u5161,m342,FRANK,Yeah.
177864,L199066,u5164,m342,JACK,You leaving that on?
177865,L199065,u5164,m342,JACK,Right.
177866,L199064,u5161,m342,FRANK,"But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible."
177867,L199063,u5164,m342,JACK,Good idea.
177868,L199062,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning."
177869,L199061,u5164,m342,JACK,Okay.
177870,L199060,u5161,m342,FRANK,We might as well do the towels the same way.
177871,L199059,u5164,m342,JACK,"No, you take the right."
177872,L199058,u5161,m342,FRANK,Unless you want the right.
177873,L199057,u5164,m342,JACK,Right.
177874,L199056,u5161,m342,FRANK,I figure that way we won't get confused.
177875,L199055,u5164,m342,JACK,Okay.
177876,L199054,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?"
177877,L199053,u5161,m342,FRANK,Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
177878,L199052,u5164,m342,JACK,"Have some more wine, Frank."
177879,L199049,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic."
177880,L199048,u5164,m342,JACK,He's drunk.
177881,L199039,u5161,m342,FRANK,A few bars!
177882,L199038,u5164,m342,JACK,"Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars."
177883,L199037,u5161,m342,FRANK,Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
177884,L199036,u5164,m342,JACK,We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
177885,L199035,u5161,m342,FRANK,It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
177886,L199034,u5164,m342,JACK,She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
177887,L199029,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view."
177888,L199028,u5164,m342,JACK,I thought we all had separate rooms.
177889,L199027,u5161,m342,FRANK,"We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries."
177890,L199026,u5164,m342,JACK,I thought we had separate rooms.
177891,L199004,u5164,m342,JACK,Sunday.
177892,L199003,u5161,m342,FRANK,Last?
177893,L199002,u5164,m342,JACK,Day.  Wednesday.
177894,L199001,u5161,m342,FRANK,First night?
177895,L199000,u5164,m342,JACK,November.  '71.
177896,L198994,u5164,m342,JACK,Two years ago.  March.
177897,L198993,u5161,m342,FRANK,"When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?"
177898,L198946,u5161,m342,FRANK,"All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway."
177899,L198945,u5164,m342,JACK,"Thanks, but I've got plans."
177900,L198944,u5161,m342,FRANK,"You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite."
177901,L198943,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay."
177902,L198942,u5164,m342,JACK,Yeah.
177903,L198941,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?"
177904,L198940,u5164,m342,JACK,Very realistic.
177905,L198939,u5161,m342,FRANK,So what do you think?
177906,L198938,u5164,m342,JACK,Just a lucky guess.
177907,L198937,u5161,m342,FRANK,You recognized me.
177908,L198936,u5164,m342,JACK,"Hey, Frank."
177909,L198895,u5164,m342,JACK,Right.
177910,L198894,u5161,m342,FRANK,Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
177911,L198893,u5164,m342,JACK,"Yeah, fine."
177912,L198892,u5161,m342,FRANK,You all right?
177913,L198890,u5164,m342,JACK,You wanna get a drink?
177914,L198889,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yeah ... Well, I gotta go."
177915,L198888,u5164,m342,JACK,Yeah.  Something.
177916,L198887,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Something, huh?  All those bids."
177917,L198886,u5164,m342,JACK,I'll take my chances.
177918,L198885,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'"
177919,L198879,u5161,m342,FRANK,"That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns."
177920,L198878,u5164,m342,JACK,Make it collect.
177921,L198875,u5161,m342,FRANK,That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
177922,L198874,u5164,m342,JACK,Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
177923,L198802,u5161,m342,FRANK,"And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all.  She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond."
177924,L198801,u5164,m342,JACK,"Oh, brother."
177925,L198759,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go."
177926,L198758,u5164,m342,JACK,How about these?
177927,L198757,u5161,m342,FRANK,See anything?
177928,L198749,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Here, how's this?"
177929,L198748,u5164,m342,JACK,No.
177930,L198721,u5164,m342,JACK,She's here.
177931,L198720,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I just wish she'd get here, that's all."
177932,L198719,u5164,m342,JACK,You're a fucking alarm clock.
177933,L198718,u5161,m342,FRANK,"All right, all right.  I'm a little tense."
177934,L198717,u5164,m342,JACK,I told you I was gonna hit you.
177935,L198716,u5161,m342,FRANK,You hit me.
177936,L198715,u5164,m342,JACK,"I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear."
177937,L198714,u5161,m342,FRANK,It's not gonna hurt you.
177938,L198713,u5164,m342,JACK,Get out of here!
177939,L198712,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Come on, stand still."
177940,L198711,u5164,m342,JACK,Get out of here.
177941,L198710,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it."
177942,L198709,u5164,m342,JACK,Awe inspiring.
177943,L198708,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?"
177944,L198707,u5164,m342,JACK,She'll get here.
177945,L198706,u5161,m342,FRANK,I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
177946,L198705,u5164,m342,JACK,It's early.
177947,L198704,u5161,m342,FRANK,Where the hell is she?
177948,L198671,u5161,m342,FRANK,Okay?
177949,L198670,u5164,m342,JACK,I'll drop the eighths.
177950,L198669,u5161,m342,FRANK,I suppose we can bring it down a little.
177951,L198649,u5161,m342,FRANK,I didn't get her number.
177952,L198648,u5164,m342,JACK,What's the matter?
177953,L198647,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl."
177954,L198646,u5164,m342,JACK,"How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote."
177955,L198645,u5164,m342,JACK,"Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget."
177956,L198644,u5161,m342,FRANK,I was just thinking what Ma would think.
177957,L198643,u5164,m342,JACK,You're getting cold feet about this.
177958,L198642,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act."
177959,L198641,u5164,m342,JACK,What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
177960,L198640,u5161,m342,FRANK,I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
177961,L198639,u5164,m342,JACK,"What are you, crazy?"
177962,L198623,u5161,m342,FRANK,All right.  What's your name?
177963,L198622,u5164,m342,JACK,Let's get it over with.
177964,L198621,u5161,m342,FRANK,Jack.
177965,L198591,u5161,m342,FRANK,I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
177966,L198590,u5164,m342,JACK,It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
177967,L198589,u5161,m342,FRANK,Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
177968,L198588,u5164,m342,JACK,What?
177969,L198587,u5161,m342,FRANK,Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
177970,L198558,u5164,m342,JACK,It never was.
177971,L198557,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack."
177972,L198556,u5164,m342,JACK,"You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us."
177973,L198555,u5161,m342,FRANK,What's that?
177974,L198554,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack."
177975,L198553,u5164,m342,JACK,"I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer."
177976,L198552,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us."
177977,L198551,u5164,m342,JACK,Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
177978,L198550,u5161,m342,FRANK,"If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --"
177979,L198549,u5164,m342,JACK,I'm not unhappy.
177980,L198548,u5161,m342,FRANK,If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
177981,L198547,u5164,m342,JACK,That's what we agreed.
177982,L198546,u5161,m342,FRANK,We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
177983,L198545,u5164,m342,JACK,"It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?"
177984,L198544,u5161,m342,FRANK,"It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?"
177985,L198543,u5164,m342,JACK,"Sure, why not."
177986,L198542,u5161,m342,FRANK,I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.  I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
177987,L198541,u5164,m342,JACK,Talk.
177988,L198540,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk."
177989,L198539,u5164,m342,JACK,"Hey, you weren't there.  Right?"
177990,L198538,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yeah, and what put him up there?"
177991,L198537,u5164,m342,JACK,A gust of wind killed him.
177992,L198534,u5164,m342,JACK,That how you see it?
177993,L198533,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it."
177994,L198532,u5164,m342,JACK,What was it like?
177995,L198531,u5161,m342,FRANK,No.
177996,L198530,u5164,m342,JACK,No?
177997,L198529,u5161,m342,FRANK,It wasn't like that.
177998,L198528,u5164,m342,JACK,"Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off."
177999,L198527,u5161,m342,FRANK,I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
178000,L198526,u5164,m342,JACK,The hell you don't.
178001,L198525,u5161,m342,FRANK,I don't know what you mean.
178002,L198524,u5164,m342,JACK,"Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?"
178003,L198523,u5164,m342,JACK,"You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?"
178004,L198522,u5161,m342,FRANK,Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
178005,L198521,u5164,m342,JACK,Terrific.
178006,L198520,u5161,m342,FRANK,The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
178007,L198519,u5164,m342,JACK,What?
178008,L198518,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Nice, huh?"
178009,L198502,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Honey, it's only Uncle Jack.  You remember Uncle Jack."
178010,L198501,u5164,m342,JACK,Your doorbell doesn't work.
178011,L198500,u5161,m342,FRANK,Jack.
178012,L198494,u5164,m342,JACK,"Yeah, okay."
178013,L198493,u5161,m342,FRANK,"So you'll come out, right?"
178014,L198492,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house."
178015,L198491,u5164,m342,JACK,What're you talking about?
178016,L198490,u5161,m342,FRANK,We don't get a gig.
178017,L198489,u5164,m342,JACK,So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
178018,L198488,u5161,m342,FRANK,It's not family.  It's business.
178019,L198487,u5164,m342,JACK,"I've had enough family for one month, Frank."
178020,L198486,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?"
178021,L198485,u5164,m342,JACK,Frank?
178022,L198484,u5161,m342,FRANK,It's me.
178023,L198483,u5164,m342,JACK,Yeah?
178024,L198482,u5161,m342,FRANK,Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
178025,L198481,u5164,m342,JACK,What's with Charlie?
178026,L198437,u5164,m342,JACK,Her hands.  Like that.
178027,L198436,u5161,m342,FRANK,What do you mean?
178028,L198435,u5164,m342,JACK,I made her nervous.
178029,L198393,u5161,m342,FRANK,You'll see.
178030,L198392,u5164,m342,JACK,So what'd we get her?
178031,L198387,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Christ, Jack, it's her birthday."
178032,L198386,u5164,m342,JACK,"You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore."
178033,L198385,u5161,m342,FRANK,Your older brother.
178034,L198384,u5164,m342,JACK,Says who?
178035,L198383,u5161,m342,FRANK,You gotta go.
178036,L198382,u5164,m342,JACK,I don't gotta go.
178037,L198381,u5161,m342,FRANK,This time you gotta go.
178038,L198380,u5164,m342,JACK,"No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go."
178039,L198379,u5161,m342,FRANK,"We gotta go, Jack."
178040,L198378,u5164,m342,JACK,So do I.
178041,L198377,u5161,m342,FRANK,"No, I mean it."
178042,L198376,u5164,m342,JACK,No thanks.
178043,L198375,u5161,m342,FRANK,"By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow."
178044,L198374,u5161,m342,FRANK,It's more than that.
178045,L198373,u5164,m342,JACK,It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
178046,L198372,u5161,m342,FRANK,Funny.  Strike a bell?
178047,L198371,u5164,m342,JACK,Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
178048,L198370,u5161,m342,FRANK,What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
178049,L198369,u5164,m342,JACK,I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
178050,L198368,u5161,m342,FRANK,Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
178051,L198367,u5164,m342,JACK,Why the interest?
178052,L198366,u5161,m342,FRANK,Seeing anyone in particular?
178053,L198365,u5164,m342,JACK,Only on odd days.
178054,L198364,u5161,m342,FRANK,Really.  You sleeping?
178055,L198363,u5164,m342,JACK,Thanks.
178056,L198362,u5161,m342,FRANK,You look awful.
178057,L198361,u5164,m342,JACK,"Trust me, you're not missing anything."
178058,L198360,u5161,m342,FRANK,"You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth."
178059,L198357,u5164,m342,JACK,Try the black Knable.
178060,L198356,u5161,m342,FRANK,What do you think?
178061,L198355,u5164,m342,JACK,Yamaha white.  Nice.
178062,L198354,u5161,m342,FRANK,What d'ya got?
178063,L198351,u5161,m342,FRANK,"What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?"
178064,L198350,u5164,m342,JACK,Bosen black.  Flat.
178065,L198349,u5161,m342,FRANK,"What d'ya got?,"
178066,L198340,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing."
178067,L198339,u5164,m342,JACK,"You got weird kids, Frank."
178068,L198338,u5161,m342,FRANK,She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
178069,L198337,u5164,m342,JACK,She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
178070,L198336,u5161,m342,FRANK,Cindy.
178071,L198335,u5164,m342,JACK,"It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ..."
178072,L198334,u5161,m342,FRANK,It was an accident.
178073,L198333,u5164,m342,JACK,"They tried to electrocute me, Frank."
178074,L198332,u5161,m342,FRANK,They don't.  They're always asking about you.
178075,L198331,u5164,m342,JACK,"Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too."
178076,L198330,u5161,m342,FRANK,You're their uncle.
178077,L198329,u5164,m342,JACK,"I hate your kids, Frank."
178078,L198328,u5161,m342,FRANK,Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
178079,L198326,u5161,m342,FRANK,Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
178080,L198325,u5164,m342,JACK,So we on tomorrow night?
178081,L198324,u5161,m342,FRANK,Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
178082,L198323,u5164,m342,JACK,Fuck him.
178083,L198322,u5161,m342,FRANK,"This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack."
178084,L198321,u5164,m342,JACK,Fuck him.
178085,L198320,u5161,m342,FRANK,You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
178086,L198318,u5164,m342,JACK,"Count the fucking money, Frank."
178087,L198317,u5161,m342,FRANK,Jack...
178088,L198316,u5164,m342,JACK,Count it.
178089,L198315,u5161,m342,FRANK,Huh?
178090,L198314,u5164,m342,JACK,Count it.
178091,L198303,u5164,m342,JACK,Like an angel.
178092,L198302,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I mean it, Jack.  Behave."
178093,L198297,u5164,m342,JACK,"Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!"
178094,L198296,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Don't make trouble, all right?"
178095,L198290,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?"
178096,L198289,u5164,m342,JACK,Lotta water.
178097,L198288,u5161,m342,FRANK,"That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?"
178098,L198287,u5164,m342,JACK,"Twenty-eight years, Frank."
178099,L198286,u5161,m342,FRANK,"You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?"
178100,L198283,u5164,m342,JACK,"No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on."
178101,L198282,u5161,m342,FRANK,You look like you just crawled out of bed.
178102,L198281,u5164,m342,JACK,What's wrong with it?
178103,L198280,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Christ, will you look at your hair?"
178104,L198279,u5164,m342,JACK,Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
178105,L198278,u5161,m342,FRANK,Jack.
178106,L198277,u5164,m342,JACK,Frank.
178107,L198276,u5161,m342,FRANK,Jack.
178108,L198275,u5164,m342,JACK,You want me to show up late a few nights?
178109,L198274,u5161,m342,FRANK,"You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack."
178110,L198273,u5164,m342,JACK,What's the point?
178111,L198272,u5161,m342,FRANK,That's not the point.
178112,L198271,u5164,m342,JACK,Am I late?
178113,L198270,u5161,m342,FRANK,"How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?"
178114,L198269,u5164,m342,JACK,How we doing?
178115,L198268,u5161,m342,FRANK,Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
178116,L199430,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,All right.
178117,L199429,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Your limo's ready, Ma."
178118,L199409,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,All right.
178119,L199408,u5161,m342,FRANK,"A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here."
178120,L199407,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,Just call me a cab.
178121,L199406,u5161,m342,FRANK,You sure?
178122,L199403,u5161,m342,FRANK,"No, we're not.  Jack?"
178123,L199402,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,"No, no.  You boys are tired."
178124,L199401,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open."
178125,L199400,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,"A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night."
178126,L199399,u5161,m342,FRANK,The audience was a little off tonight.
178127,L199398,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,Thrilling.  Both of you.
178128,L199397,u5161,m342,FRANK,So what'd you think?
178129,L199396,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,Spur of the moment.
178130,L199395,u5161,m342,FRANK,"You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you."
178131,L199377,u5171,m342,NICK,"What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad."
178132,L199376,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up."
178133,L199375,u5171,m342,NICK,"You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical."
178134,L199374,u5161,m342,FRANK,Doctor's orders.
178135,L199373,u5171,m342,NICK,So she's got a few sniffles.
178136,L199372,u5161,m342,FRANK,The flu.
178137,L199371,u5171,m342,NICK,Sick?  How sick?
178138,L198584,u5167,m342,MONICA,Well ... thanks.  Bye.
178139,L198583,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yes, it is."
178140,L198582,u5167,m342,MONICA,"Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary."
178141,L198576,u5167,m342,MONICA,Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
178142,L198575,u5161,m342,FRANK,Uh... he knows it.
178143,L198573,u5161,m342,FRANK,It's one of Jack's favorites.
178144,L198572,u5167,m342,MONICA,Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
178145,L198571,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?"
178146,L198570,u5167,m342,MONICA,"And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career."
178147,L198569,u5161,m342,FRANK,Right.
178148,L198568,u5167,m342,MONICA,"But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up."
178149,L198567,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Well, that's fine --"
178150,L198566,u5167,m342,MONICA,"No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer."
178151,L198565,u5161,m342,FRANK,Blanche.
178152,L198564,u5167,m342,MONICA,Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
178153,L198563,u5161,m342,FRANK,I'm sorry?
178154,L198562,u5167,m342,MONICA,"Actually, that's my stage name."
178155,L199161,u5161,m342,FRANK,Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
178156,L199160,u5176,m342,WOMAN,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons."
178157,L198625,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Catchy.  You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?"
178158,L198624,u5176,m342,WOMAN,Susie.  Susie Diamond.
178159,L198618,u5176,m342,WOMAN,What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
178160,L198617,u5161,m342,FRANK,Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
178161,L198614,u5176,m342,WOMAN,You find a girl?
178162,L198613,u5161,m342,FRANK,Miss --
178163,L198612,u5176,m342,WOMAN,So run a little longer.
178164,L198611,u5161,m342,FRANK,We ran long.
178165,L198610,u5176,m342,WOMAN,So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
178166,L198609,u5161,m342,FRANK,You're an hour and a half late.
178167,L198608,u5176,m342,WOMAN,"I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late."
178168,L198607,u5161,m342,FRANK,Impersonally.
178169,L198606,u5176,m342,WOMAN,How should I take it?
178170,L198605,u5161,m342,FRANK,Don't take it personally.
178171,L198604,u5176,m342,WOMAN,"Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?"
178172,L198603,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home."
178173,L198602,u5176,m342,WOMAN,This is show business?
178174,L198601,u5161,m342,FRANK,Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
178175,L198600,u5176,m342,WOMAN,"My watch is broken, too."
178176,L198599,u5161,m342,FRANK,You're an hour and a half late.
178177,L198598,u5176,m342,WOMAN,What about me?
178178,L198597,u5161,m342,FRANK,We're finished.
178179,L198596,u5176,m342,WOMAN,What do you mean?
178180,L198595,u5161,m342,FRANK,This is where the auditions were.
178181,L198594,u5176,m342,WOMAN,This where the auditions are?
178182,L199281,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!"
178183,L199280,u5161,m342,FRANK,Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
178184,L199279,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?"
178185,L199278,u5161,m342,FRANK,What're you talking about?  They love it.
178186,L199277,u5173,m342,SUSIE,That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
178187,L199276,u5161,m342,FRANK,What?
178188,L199275,u5173,m342,SUSIE,I can't sing it anymore.
178189,L199273,u5161,m342,FRANK,Forget it.
178190,L199272,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Huh?
178191,L199271,u5161,m342,FRANK,How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
178192,L199204,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Forget it.
178193,L199203,u5161,m342,FRANK,I guess I ... If I jumped to...
178194,L199193,u5161,m342,FRANK,I just saw a man walk out of your room!
178195,L199192,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Some discussion.
178196,L199188,u5161,m342,FRANK,No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
178197,L199187,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Decency?  Hey listen, pal ..."
178198,L199186,u5161,m342,FRANK,"In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency."
178199,L199185,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Uh ...
178200,L199184,u5161,m342,FRANK,I just saw a man walk out of your room.
178201,L199183,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Huh?
178202,L199182,u5161,m342,FRANK,You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
178203,L199181,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!"
178204,L199126,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack."
178205,L199125,u5173,m342,SUSIE,What's with you guys?
178206,L199120,u5161,m342,FRANK,Well then ... shall we?
178207,L199119,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
178208,L199118,u5161,m342,FRANK,Got another song for us?
178209,L199117,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Huh?
178210,L199116,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it."
178211,L199110,u5161,m342,FRANK,Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
178212,L199109,u5173,m342,SUSIE,What's with you two?
178213,L199051,u5161,m342,FRANK,"He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?"
178214,L199050,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Oh yeah?
178215,L199047,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank."
178216,L199046,u5161,m342,FRANK,What do you say we send a bottle over?
178217,L199045,u5173,m342,SUSIE,They must've bought the same map we did.
178218,L199044,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Hey, will you look at that?"
178219,L199043,u5161,m342,FRANK,"No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?"
178220,L199042,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Wow. You ever see her again?
178221,L199041,u5161,m342,FRANK,"People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play."
178222,L199040,u5173,m342,SUSIE,What'd she sing?
178223,L199033,u5161,m342,FRANK,Tell her.
178224,L199032,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Peggy Lee?
178225,L199031,u5161,m342,FRANK,As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
178226,L199030,u5173,m342,SUSIE,You're kidding me.
178227,L199025,u5161,m342,FRANK,Yeah.
178228,L199024,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Great?
178229,L199023,u5161,m342,FRANK,Great.
178230,L199022,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Hey, we're connected."
178231,L199013,u5161,m342,FRANK,It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
178232,L199012,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Smells like tuna number two to me.
178233,L199011,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?"
178234,L199010,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Smells like fish.
178235,L199009,u5161,m342,FRANK,"And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life."
178236,L199006,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it."
178237,L199005,u5173,m342,SUSIE,I don't believe it.
178238,L198999,u5161,m342,FRANK,Jack?
178239,L198998,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
178240,L198997,u5161,m342,FRANK,Go ahead.
178241,L198996,u5161,m342,FRANK,He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
178242,L198995,u5173,m342,SUSIE,He's right.
178243,L198992,u5161,m342,FRANK,"First times. Hey, look at this."
178244,L198991,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Virgins?
178245,L198990,u5161,m342,FRANK,Virgins.
178246,L198989,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?"
178247,L198988,u5161,m342,FRANK,Baker's unabridged.
178248,L198987,u5173,m342,SUSIE,You play all these places?
178249,L198983,u5161,m342,FRANK,Sorry.  It only plays static.
178250,L198982,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
178251,L198981,u5161,m342,FRANK,You two could play checkers.
178252,L198948,u5161,m342,FRANK,"For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth."
178253,L198947,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?"
178254,L198883,u5173,m342,SUSIE,So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
178255,L198882,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Uh, well ... we flipped a coin."
178256,L198877,u5161,m342,FRANK,Maybe.  I'll call him.
178257,L198876,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Maybe it's legit.
178258,L198873,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Hey.
178259,L198872,u5161,m342,FRANK,"By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate."
178260,L198868,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"We take the Avedon, right?  Simple."
178261,L198867,u5161,m342,FRANK,"I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two."
178262,L198866,u5173,m342,SUSIE,The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
178263,L198865,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Jack, you with us?"
178264,L198823,u5161,m342,FRANK,We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
178265,L198822,u5173,m342,SUSIE,I was gonna split it with you guys.
178266,L198821,u5161,m342,FRANK,We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
178267,L198820,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Hey!
178268,L198819,u5161,m342,FRANK,Give me that.
178269,L198818,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?"
178270,L198817,u5161,m342,FRANK,Fucking.
178271,L198814,u5161,m342,FRANK,Did you hear it?
178272,L198813,u5173,m342,SUSIE,I said I was sorry.
178273,L198812,u5161,m342,FRANK,Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
178274,L198804,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Switch?  What fucking switch?
178275,L198803,u5161,m342,FRANK,The switch.  Hit the switch.
178276,L198788,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Piece of cake.
178277,L198787,u5161,m342,FRANK,Right.
178278,L198786,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ..."
178279,L198785,u5161,m342,FRANK,"We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ..."
178280,L198778,u5173,m342,SUSIE,You're a prince.
178281,L198777,u5161,m342,FRANK,Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
178282,L198776,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Oh, thanks."
178283,L198775,u5161,m342,FRANK,You can buy new ones tomorrow.
178284,L198774,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Well, they're aspiring to be sevens."
178285,L198773,u5161,m342,FRANK,They're nines.
178286,L198772,u5173,m342,SUSIE,They're tight.
178287,L198771,u5161,m342,FRANK,Right.
178288,L198770,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Shoes?
178289,L198769,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Zip me up?
178290,L198768,u5161,m342,FRANK,Uh... good.
178291,L198767,u5173,m342,SUSIE,What do you think?
178292,L198756,u5161,m342,FRANK,Big feet.
178293,L198755,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Nine!
178294,L198754,u5161,m342,FRANK,Nine?
178295,L198753,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Nine.
178296,L198752,u5161,m342,FRANK,"All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?"
178297,L198751,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go."
178298,L198747,u5161,m342,FRANK,"We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?"
178299,L198746,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Save it for your wife.
178300,L198745,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?"
178301,L198744,u5173,m342,SUSIE,I wear a seven.
178302,L198743,u5161,m342,FRANK,My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
178303,L198742,u5173,m342,SUSIE,A seven.
178304,L198741,u5161,m342,FRANK,Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
178305,L198740,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"If you ask me, this is pretty stupid."
178306,L198739,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Time for what?
178307,L198738,u5161,m342,FRANK,Come on.  We don't have much time.
178308,L198737,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Hey!
178309,L198736,u5161,m342,FRANK,Come on.
178310,L198735,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Am I missing something?
178311,L198734,u5161,m342,FRANK,It's orange!
178312,L198733,u5173,m342,SUSIE,What's wrong with it?
178313,L198732,u5161,m342,FRANK,That!  You can't wear that!
178314,L198731,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Do I look like I'm naked?
178315,L198730,u5161,m342,FRANK,Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
178316,L198729,u5173,m342,SUSIE,What's he talking about?
178317,L198728,u5161,m342,FRANK,Where's your dress?
178318,L198727,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Changed?
178319,L198726,u5161,m342,FRANK,"We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed."
178320,L198725,u5173,m342,SUSIE,And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
178321,L198724,u5161,m342,FRANK,What-?
178322,L198723,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Where's my name?
178323,L198722,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late."
178324,L198668,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"So work with me, not against me. Okay?"
178325,L198667,u5161,m342,FRANK,We're a team.  We work together.
178326,L198666,u5173,m342,SUSIE,What I mean is --
178327,L198665,u5161,m342,FRANK,No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
178328,L198664,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?"
178329,L198662,u5173,m342,SUSIE,The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
178330,L198661,u5161,m342,FRANK,What's the problem?
178331,L198658,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?"
178332,L198657,u5161,m342,FRANK,Ready?
178333,L198637,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
178334,L198636,u5161,m342,FRANK,When we know.
178335,L198635,u5173,m342,SUSIE,When?
178336,L198634,u5161,m342,FRANK,Uh ... we'll let you know.
178337,L198633,u5173,m342,SUSIE,So?
178338,L198630,u5161,m342,FRANK,That's the premise.
178339,L198629,u5173,m342,SUSIE,I sing now?
178340,L198628,u5161,m342,FRANK,Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
178341,L198627,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance."
178342,L199090,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Uh, well ..."
178343,L199089,u5168,m342,MR. DANIELS,Is that important?
178344,L199088,u5161,m342,FRANK,They are in tune.  But not with each other.
178345,L199087,u5168,m342,MR. DANIELS,Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
178346,L199086,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Yes, well, they are."
178347,L199085,u5168,m342,MR. DANIELS,Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
178348,L199084,u5161,m342,FRANK,"That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack."
178349,L199083,u5168,m342,MR. DANIELS,"Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone."
178350,L198829,u5161,m342,FRANK,"We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that."
178351,L198828,u5166,m342,LLOYD,"Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?"
178352,L198827,u5161,m342,FRANK,Born and bred.
178353,L198826,u5166,m342,LLOYD,"Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?"
178354,L198313,u5166,m342,LLOYD,I'll call you.
178355,L198312,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe..."
178356,L198311,u5166,m342,LLOYD,I'll call you.
178357,L198310,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?"
178358,L198307,u5161,m342,FRANK,Uh ... thanks.
178359,L198306,u5166,m342,LLOYD,"Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this."
178360,L198305,u5161,m342,FRANK,"Thanks, Lloyd."
178361,L198304,u5166,m342,LLOYD,"Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific."
178362,L198255,u5162,m342,GIRL,"I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit."
178363,L198254,u5164,m342,JACK,Thanks.
178364,L198253,u5162,m342,GIRL,"Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep."
178365,L198252,u5164,m342,JACK,Brought it.
178366,L198249,u5162,m342,GIRL,Will I see you again?
178367,L198248,u5164,m342,JACK,Funny job.
178368,L198247,u5162,m342,GIRL,Funny hours.
178369,L198246,u5164,m342,JACK,Job.
178370,L198245,u5162,m342,GIRL,How come?
178371,L198244,u5164,m342,JACK,Gotta go.
178372,L198243,u5162,m342,GIRL,Whatcha doin' over there?

178375,L198839,u5176,m342,WOMAN,"They never do, Mr. Barker."
178376,L198838,u5164,m342,JACK,He doesn't bite.
178377,L198837,u5176,m342,WOMAN,"You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten."
178378,L198836,u5164,m342,JACK,"Come on, Ed."
178379,L198835,u5176,m342,WOMAN,Right.  Bring him back.
178380,L198834,u5164,m342,JACK,Baker.  Jack Baker.
178381,L198833,u5176,m342,WOMAN,Barker.  Jock Barker?
178382,L198620,u5176,m342,WOMAN,"You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you."
178383,L198619,u5164,m342,JACK,Don't worry about it.
178384,L198616,u5176,m342,WOMAN,"So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?"
178385,L198615,u5164,m342,JACK,No.
178386,L198930,u5165,m342,KID,All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
178387,L198929,u5164,m342,JACK,Black.  Labrador.
178388,L198928,u5165,m342,KID,Save it.  What's he look like?
178389,L198927,u5164,m342,JACK,The name's Baker --
178390,L198926,u5165,m342,KID,All right.  Hold on.
178391,L198925,u5164,m342,JACK,Yeah.
178392,L198924,u5165,m342,KID,You want to know if he's okay. Right?
178393,L198923,u5164,m342,JACK,"Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?"
178394,L198922,u5165,m342,KID,You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
178395,L198921,u5164,m342,JACK,"Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him."
178396,L198920,u5165,m342,KID,Regular hours are eight to five.
178397,L198919,u5164,m342,JACK,"No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth."
178398,L199426,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,Yes.  I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
178399,L199425,u5164,m342,JACK,"It's been a long time, Ma."
178400,L199424,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,"You miss him, don't you?"
178401,L199422,u5164,m342,JACK,I suppose.
178402,L199421,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,"Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in."
178403,L199420,u5164,m342,JACK,For a while.  She left.
178404,L199419,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
178405,L199418,u5164,m342,JACK,Pretty much.
178406,L199417,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,Is that the way it is?
178407,L199416,u5164,m342,JACK,"He leads, I follow."
178408,L199415,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,And you don't?
178409,L199414,u5164,m342,JACK,Frank works hard.
178410,L199413,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,It went well tonight.
178411,L199405,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
178412,L199404,u5164,m342,JACK,No.
178413,L198407,u5164,m342,JACK,Downstairs.
178414,L198406,u5169,m342,MRS.  BAKER,"Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?"
178415,L199574,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song."
178416,L199573,u5164,m342,JACK,Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
178417,L199572,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Yeah.
178418,L199571,u5164,m342,JACK,I didn't want to wake you.
178419,L199570,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though."
178420,L199567,u5164,m342,JACK,No.
178421,L199566,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Let me get the light.
178422,L199563,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal."
178423,L199562,u5164,m342,JACK,Hi.
178424,L199561,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Jack.
178425,L199545,u5164,m342,JACK,If I see him.
178426,L199544,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
178427,L199542,u5164,m342,JACK,I've given it up.
178428,L199541,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --"
178429,L199540,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
178430,L199539,u5164,m342,JACK,Vegetables.
178431,L199538,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Huh?
178432,L199537,u5164,m342,JACK,What kind?
178433,L199536,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
178434,L199535,u5164,m342,JACK,So how's the cat food business?
178435,L199534,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Yeah.
178436,L199533,u5164,m342,JACK,You don't pick your brother.
178437,L199532,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two."
178438,L199531,u5164,m342,JACK,We outgrew each other.
178439,L199530,u5173,m342,SUSIE,So ... ?
178440,L199529,u5164,m342,JACK,Yeah.  Got my own sign.
178441,L199528,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?"
178442,L199370,u5164,m342,JACK,There's always another girl.
178443,L199369,u5173,m342,SUSIE,You can always get another girl.
178444,L199364,u5164,m342,JACK,"If our feet get hot, you grab the piano."
178445,L199363,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Shit.  I think I started a fire.
178446,L199362,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!"
178447,L199361,u5164,m342,JACK,"Look, if you want to leave..."
178448,L199360,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Yeah... No.
178449,L199359,u5164,m342,JACK,Coffee?
178450,L199358,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
178451,L199353,u5164,m342,JACK,Frank wasn't 'there.
178452,L199352,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Frank said ---
178453,L199350,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Oh.
178454,L199349,u5164,m342,JACK,Ma didn't want it around.  After.
178455,L199348,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
178456,L199347,u5164,m342,JACK,I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
178457,L199346,u5164,m342,JACK,"He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb."
178458,L199345,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"So, what happened?"
178459,L199344,u5164,m342,JACK,He had a mind that escalated things.
178460,L199343,u5173,m342,SUSIE,You're kidding.
178461,L199342,u5164,m342,JACK,"By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition."
178462,L199341,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Nervous?
178463,L199340,u5164,m342,JACK,"They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous."
178464,L199339,u5173,m342,SUSIE,You sending me home?
178465,L199338,u5164,m342,JACK,Long story.
178466,L199337,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Oh. So what's it doing here?
178467,L199336,u5164,m342,JACK,He called her.
178468,L199335,u5173,m342,SUSIE,The both of them?  In there?
178469,L199334,u5173,m342,SUSIE,No kidding?
178470,L199333,u5164,m342,JACK,My father proposed to my mother in there.
178471,L199332,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Huh?
178472,L199331,u5164,m342,JACK,History.
178473,L199327,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby."
178474,L199326,u5164,m342,JACK,Soap?
178475,L199325,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Soap convention.
178476,L199324,u5164,m342,JACK,Must've been a cheap date.
178477,L199323,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt."
178478,L199319,u5164,m342,JACK,How come you didn't close your eyes?
178479,L199318,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it."
178480,L199317,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Sure.
178481,L199316,u5164,m342,JACK,I have to make him some chili. Okay?
178482,L199315,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Ed? How many people live here?
178483,L199314,u5164,m342,JACK,She's four feet tall.  Ed?
178484,L199313,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
178485,L199312,u5164,m342,JACK,Friend.
178486,L199311,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Who's Nina?
178487,L199310,u5164,m342,JACK,Nina?
178488,L199308,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!"
178489,L199307,u5164,m342,JACK,How do you know?
178490,L199306,u5173,m342,SUSIE,You were good.
178491,L199305,u5164,m342,JACK,Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
178492,L199304,u5173,m342,SUSIE,You were good.
178493,L199303,u5164,m342,JACK,It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
178494,L199302,u5173,m342,SUSIE,What's that supposed to mean?
178495,L199301,u5164,m342,JACK,Look. You don't know good. All right?
178496,L199300,u5173,m342,SUSIE,All I said was you were good.
178497,L199299,u5164,m342,JACK,I'm not upset.
178498,L199298,u5173,m342,SUSIE,You're upset.
178499,L199297,u5164,m342,JACK,Nothing.
178500,L199296,u5173,m342,SUSIE,What'd I say?
178501,L199295,u5164,m342,JACK,Nothing.
178502,L199294,u5173,m342,SUSIE,What's the matter?
178503,L199293,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Better than that.
178504,L199292,u5164,m342,JACK,I can keep the beat.
178505,L199288,u5164,m342,JACK,"Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few."
178506,L199287,u5173,m342,SUSIE,How do you do it? Every night?
178507,L199286,u5164,m342,JACK,It's a shitty  song.
178508,L199285,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Guess I got a little scattered.
178509,L199284,u5164,m342,JACK,Relax.  We'll drop the song.
178510,L199210,u5164,m342,JACK,"Just dinner and dance, right?"
178511,L199209,u5173,m342,SUSIE,It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
178512,L199208,u5164,m342,JACK,"Hey, business is business."
178513,L199207,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in."
178514,L199138,u5164,m342,JACK,No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
178515,L199137,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"If you want, I got a pack in the room."
178516,L199136,u5173,m342,SUSIE,In and out.
178517,L199135,u5164,m342,JACK,Like a baby. You?
178518,L199134,u5173,m342,SUSIE,How's egghead?
178519,L199133,u5164,m342,JACK,"Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets."
178520,L199132,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean."
178521,L199131,u5164,m342,JACK,In and out.
178522,L199130,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Can't sleep?
178523,L199129,u5164,m342,JACK,It's okay.  Last one.
178524,L199128,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell."
178525,L198954,u5164,m342,JACK,I guess in case one year they're not.
178526,L198953,u5173,m342,SUSIE,So why's he do it?
178527,L198952,u5164,m342,JACK,Every year.
178528,L198951,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Aren't the kids asleep?
178529,L198950,u5164,m342,JACK,Every year.
178530,L198949,u5173,m342,SUSIE,He do that every year?
178531,L198915,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Nothing personal --
178532,L198914,u5164,m342,JACK,Forget it.
178533,L198913,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all."
178534,L198912,u5164,m342,JACK,Forget it.
178535,L198911,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp."
178536,L198910,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back."
178537,L198909,u5164,m342,JACK,You want me to walk you?
178538,L198908,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes."
178539,L198907,u5164,m342,JACK,Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
178540,L198906,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir."
178541,L198905,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  Ah, here's a lost soul."
178542,L198904,u5164,m342,JACK,Huh?
178543,L198903,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?"
178544,L198902,u5164,m342,JACK,The Stratford.
178545,L198901,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
178546,L198900,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit."
178547,L198899,u5164,m342,JACK,He takes after our mother.
178548,L198898,u5173,m342,SUSIE,I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
178549,L198897,u5164,m342,JACK,His kid's sick.
178550,L198896,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Where's egghead?
178551,L198871,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Oh.  Well, for Blackie then."
178552,L198870,u5164,m342,JACK,Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
178553,L198869,u5173,m342,SUSIE,The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
178554,L198816,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway."
178555,L198815,u5164,m342,JACK,Fucking.
178556,L198678,u5173,m342,SUSIE,Not for money. With my mother.
178557,L198677,u5164,m342,JACK,You never sang before?
178558,L198676,u5164,m342,JACK,He'll come around.
178559,L198675,u5173,m342,SUSIE,"Hey, he's not sore, is he?"
178560,L198267,u5174,m342,TOMMY,He's got blood in his eye.
178561,L198266,u5164,m342,JACK,It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
178562,L198265,u5174,m342,TOMMY,"Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie."
178563,L198264,u5164,m342,JACK,"Another five years, huh?"
178564,L198263,u5174,m342,TOMMY,Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
178565,L198262,u5164,m342,JACK,"Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy."
178566,L198261,u5174,m342,TOMMY,No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
178567,L198260,u5164,m342,JACK,Losing his teeth.
178568,L198259,u5174,m342,TOMMY,"Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?"
178569,L198973,u5172,m342,NINA,That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
178570,L198972,u5164,m342,JACK,Sure.
178571,L198971,u5172,m342,NINA,"There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?"
178572,L198967,u5164,m342,JACK,Merry Christmas.
178573,L198966,u5172,m342,NINA,"Merry Christmas, Jack."
178574,L198964,u5172,m342,NINA,Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
178575,L198963,u5164,m342,JACK,Yeah?
178576,L198962,u5172,m342,NINA,Jack.
178577,L198961,u5164,m342,JACK,Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
178578,L198960,u5172,m342,NINA,From Hurley's?
178579,L198958,u5172,m342,NINA,Not so good.
178580,L198957,u5164,m342,JACK,Okay.  How'd yours go?
178581,L198956,u5172,m342,NINA,How'd the show go?
178582,L198933,u5164,m342,JACK,"He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can."
178583,L198932,u5172,m342,NINA,I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
178584,L198702,u5164,m342,JACK,Ever go to church?
178585,L198701,u5172,m342,NINA,What's a prom?
178586,L198700,u5164,m342,JACK,"Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?"
178587,L198699,u5172,m342,NINA,Why not?
178588,L198698,u5164,m342,JACK,"Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?"
178589,L198697,u5172,m342,NINA,Wow.
178590,L198696,u5164,m342,JACK,Older than me.
178591,L198695,u5172,m342,NINA,Looks old.
178592,L198694,u5164,m342,JACK,Ivory.
178593,L198693,u5172,m342,NINA,"I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?"
178594,L198692,u5164,m342,JACK,Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
178595,L198691,u5172,m342,NINA,I guess it's getting serious.
178596,L198690,u5164,m342,JACK,Oh?
178597,L198689,u5172,m342,NINA,I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
178598,L198688,u5164,m342,JACK,How do you know?
178599,L198687,u5172,m342,NINA,Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
178600,L198686,u5164,m342,JACK,The recent past.
178601,L198685,u5172,m342,NINA,What are they?
178602,L198684,u5164,m342,JACK,"My days are not the old days, genius."
178603,L198683,u5172,m342,NINA,Is that what you used to do?
178604,L198682,u5164,m342,JACK,"In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him."
178605,L198450,u5172,m342,NINA,Married.
178606,L198449,u5164,m342,JACK,What happened to the donut king?
178607,L198448,u5172,m342,NINA,Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
178608,L198447,u5164,m342,JACK,Sounds big.  What's he do?
178609,L198446,u5172,m342,NINA,Guess they're up.
178610,L198444,u5164,m342,JACK,Eddie did.
178611,L198443,u5172,m342,NINA,"Did you break a cup, Jack?"
178612,L198420,u5164,m342,JACK,He's losing his teeth.
178613,L198419,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
178614,L198418,u5164,m342,JACK,Eddie.
178615,L198417,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
178616,L198416,u5164,m342,JACK,I'm not much for sweets.
178617,L198415,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,None?
178618,L198414,u5164,m342,JACK,"Huh? Oh, no."
178619,L198413,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,Big piece or little?
178620,L198412,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,"Oh, fine."
178621,L198411,u5164,m342,JACK,Fine.  You?
178622,L198410,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,So. How are you?
178623,L198398,u5164,m342,JACK,"Good to see you, Ma."
178624,L198397,u5170,m342,MRS. BAKER,John.  It's good to see you.
178625,L201015,u5191,m343,WAXY,He hit a guard.
178626,L201014,u5177,m343,ARCHER,What did he do?
178627,L201013,u5191,m343,WAXY,They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
178628,L201012,u5177,m343,ARCHER,You mean if I get sick?
178629,L201011,u5191,m343,WAXY,"Not unless you're sent to the ""Clinic."""
178630,L201010,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
178631,L200849,u5191,m343,WAXY,"You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm."
178632,L200848,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Do I look wasted -- asshole?
178633,L200847,u5191,m343,WAXY,They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
178634,L200846,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
178635,L200777,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,"What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?"
178636,L200776,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere."
178637,L200775,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,"Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --"
178638,L200774,u5177,m343,ARCHER,He's lying.
178639,L200740,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description."
178640,L200739,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
178641,L200738,u5177,m343,ARCHER,... Thanks.
178642,L200737,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,"I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say ""thanks""?"
178643,L200736,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties."
178644,L200735,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,"Fine work, Jon."
178645,L201130,u5187,m343,SASHA,You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
178646,L201129,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
178647,L201128,u5187,m343,SASHA,Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
178648,L201127,u5177,m343,ARCHER,How old is he?
178649,L201126,u5187,m343,SASHA,"Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either."
178650,L201121,u5187,m343,SASHA,Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
178651,L201120,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Nice-looking kid.
178652,L201119,u5187,m343,SASHA,Should be.  It's yours.
178653,L201118,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Perfect fit.
178654,L201114,u5177,m343,ARCHER,I'm not the same person you remember.
178655,L201113,u5187,m343,SASHA,Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
178656,L201112,u5177,m343,ARCHER,I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
178657,L201111,u5187,m343,SASHA,"Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long."
178658,L201110,u5177,m343,ARCHER,You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
178659,L201109,u5187,m343,SASHA,My place.
178660,L201108,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Where am I?
178661,L201093,u5187,m343,SASHA,The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
178662,L201092,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Drive.
178663,L201091,u5187,m343,SASHA,"Jesus Christ, Castor."
178664,L201090,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Yeah -- me.
178665,L201089,u5187,m343,SASHA,"Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble."
178666,L201151,u5180,m343,DIETRICH,Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
178667,L201150,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Or reactivated the first one.
178668,L201149,u5180,m343,DIETRICH,"He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb."
178669,L201148,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Why would he need more?
178670,L201147,u5180,m343,DIETRICH,"Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more."
178671,L201146,u5177,m343,ARCHER,And this thing can grow it?
178672,L200893,u5186,m343,POLLUX,"""Thanks?""  I guess they really did fuck you up."
178673,L200892,u5177,m343,ARCHER,For being one helluva guy.
178674,L200891,u5186,m343,POLLUX,For what?
178675,L200890,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Thanks, Pollux."
178676,L200888,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian."
178677,L200887,u5186,m343,POLLUX,What's worse than losing five million bucks?
178678,L200886,u5177,m343,ARCHER,That's not the worst part.
178679,L200883,u5186,m343,POLLUX,Only one you've never broken.
178680,L200882,u5177,m343,ARCHER,And I bet I've kept that promise ...
178681,L200881,u5186,m343,POLLUX,After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
178682,L200880,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Uh -- to kill the doctors?
178683,L200879,u5186,m343,POLLUX,Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
178684,L200878,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General."
178685,L200876,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Like ...
178686,L200875,u5186,m343,POLLUX,A few blanks?  Like what?
178687,L200874,u5177,m343,ARCHER,I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
178688,L200873,u5186,m343,POLLUX,You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
178689,L200872,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
178690,L200871,u5186,m343,POLLUX,Let me have a look.
178691,L200870,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit."
178692,L200869,u5186,m343,POLLUX,"You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different."
178693,L200868,u5177,m343,ARCHER,What do you mean?
178694,L200867,u5186,m343,POLLUX,So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
178695,L200866,u5177,m343,ARCHER,So?
178696,L200865,u5186,m343,POLLUX,Shut up.
178697,L200864,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Pollux ...
178698,L200859,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ..."
178699,L200858,u5186,m343,POLLUX,You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
178700,L200857,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Hey, bro ..."
178701,L201266,u5182,m343,EVE,Damn right.
178702,L201265,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Would it?
178703,L201264,u5182,m343,EVE,I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
178704,L201259,u5177,m343,ARCHER,That's what they always say.
178705,L201258,u5182,m343,EVE,No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
178706,L201257,u5177,m343,ARCHER,How is he?
178707,L201204,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Eve ...
178708,L201203,u5182,m343,EVE,"Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together."
178709,L201202,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is ""me."" We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off."
178710,L201201,u5182,m343,EVE,Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
178711,L201200,u5177,m343,ARCHER,The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
178712,L201199,u5182,m343,EVE,"Jon, what is it?"
178713,L201198,u5177,m343,ARCHER,You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
178714,L201197,u5182,m343,EVE,-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
178715,L201196,u5177,m343,ARCHER,He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
178716,L201195,u5182,m343,EVE,What do you mean?
178717,L201194,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
178718,L201193,u5182,m343,EVE,"He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ..."
178719,L201191,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --"
178720,L201190,u5182,m343,EVE,"Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?"
178721,L201188,u5182,m343,EVE,Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
178722,L201187,u5177,m343,ARCHER,What more proof do you need?
178723,L201186,u5182,m343,EVE,I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
178724,L201185,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
178725,L201184,u5182,m343,EVE,I took it from my fake husband.
178726,L201171,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me."
178727,L201170,u5182,m343,EVE,How did he expect to do that?
178728,L201169,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband."
178729,L201168,u5182,m343,EVE,I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
178730,L201086,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Don't hang up ...
178731,L201085,u5182,m343,EVE,"Whoever you are, don't call again."
178732,L201084,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ..."
178733,L201083,u5182,m343,EVE,"Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --"
178734,L201082,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
178735,L201081,u5182,m343,EVE,Who is this?
178736,L201079,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't."
178737,L201078,u5182,m343,EVE,Is someone there?
178738,L200809,u5182,m343,EVE,"You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!"
178739,L200808,u5177,m343,ARCHER,I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
178740,L200807,u5182,m343,EVE,You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
178741,L200806,u5177,m343,ARCHER,One last time.  It's important ...
178742,L200805,u5182,m343,EVE,"What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ..."
178743,L200803,u5182,m343,EVE,And you wouldn't be.
178744,L200802,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive."
178745,L200801,u5182,m343,EVE,I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
178746,L200800,u5177,m343,ARCHER,How come?
178747,L200799,u5182,m343,EVE,No.
178748,L200798,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Were you there to catch me?
178749,L200797,u5182,m343,EVE,"Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open."
178750,L200796,u5177,m343,ARCHER,So you had a nightmare.
178751,L200795,u5182,m343,EVE,Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
178752,L200794,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Must've been after we got engaged.
178753,L200793,u5182,m343,EVE,"We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you."
178754,L200792,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Something good?
178755,L200791,u5182,m343,EVE,... I was dreaming ...
178756,L200758,u5182,m343,EVE,So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
178757,L200757,u5177,m343,ARCHER,It's important.
178758,L200756,u5182,m343,EVE,I'm late for surgery.
178759,L200755,u5177,m343,ARCHER,We need to talk.
178760,L200754,u5182,m343,EVE,Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
178761,L200753,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Is that what you think?
178762,L200752,u5182,m343,EVE,"She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying ""I love you."""
178763,L200751,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
178764,L200750,u5182,m343,EVE,"Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried."
178765,L200833,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Just make sure you're there.  On time.
178766,L200832,u5188,m343,TITO,"This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own."
178767,L200831,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
178768,L200830,u5188,m343,TITO,Now what?
178769,L200818,u5188,m343,TITO,"Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there."
178770,L200817,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
178771,L200816,u5188,m343,TITO,"You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you."
178772,L200815,u5177,m343,ARCHER,She doesn't know -- and she never will.
178773,L200814,u5188,m343,TITO,"Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?"
178774,L200783,u5188,m343,TITO,"The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet."
178775,L200782,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Which ear was it?
178776,L200780,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk."
178777,L200779,u5188,m343,TITO,We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
178778,L200771,u5188,m343,TITO,"Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ..."
178779,L200770,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Go on.
178780,L200769,u5188,m343,TITO,"Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ..."
178781,L200768,u5177,m343,ARCHER,How's Loomis?
178782,L200714,u5181,m343,DR. GARDNER,"You said it, Jon, not me."
178783,L200713,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying."
178784,L200712,u5181,m343,DR. GARDNER,"I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job."
178785,L200711,u5177,m343,ARCHER,One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
178786,L200710,u5181,m343,DR. GARDNER,You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
178787,L200709,u5177,m343,ARCHER,I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
178788,L200708,u5181,m343,DR. GARDNER,"You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet."
178789,L200707,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one."
178790,L200706,u5181,m343,DR. GARDNER,"How is the ""date night"" idea going over with Eve?"
178791,L201243,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Shoot him!
178792,L201242,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Jamie ...
178793,L201239,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Not if I kill you first ...
178794,L201238,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out."
178795,L201237,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Five seconds.
178796,L201236,u5177,m343,ARCHER,I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
178797,L201234,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
178798,L201233,u5179,m343,CASTOR,What -- what are you doing?
178799,L201137,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her."
178800,L201136,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Stay away from my family!
178801,L200905,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean ""make love to."""
178802,L200904,u5177,m343,ARCHER,What are you going to do!
178803,L200903,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
178804,L200902,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"What are you going to do, Castor?"
178805,L200901,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life."
178806,L200900,u5177,m343,ARCHER,You killed them?
178807,L200899,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was ""titanically remote.""  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here."
178808,L200898,u5177,m343,ARCHER,It can't be.  It's impossible.
178809,L200897,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Not anymore.
178810,L200896,u5177,m343,ARCHER,-- Castor?
178811,L200732,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Don't count on it.
178812,L200731,u5177,m343,ARCHER,You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
178813,L200730,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it."
178814,L200729,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Mention my family once more and you're dead.
178815,L200728,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?"
178816,L200727,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --"
178817,L200726,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --"
178818,L200725,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"And how much will your ""fun"" net you this time?"
178819,L200724,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun."
178820,L200913,u5189,m343,WALTON,Or what?  You'll have me fired?
178821,L200912,u5177,m343,ARCHER,"Walton, you have to let me see the warden --"
178822,L200911,u5189,m343,WALTON,Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
178823,L200910,u5177,m343,ARCHER,Pollux is -- what?
178824,L200909,u5189,m343,WALTON,"You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone."
178825,L200855,u5177,m343,ARCHER,I'm going to have you fired.
178826,L200854,u5189,m343,WALTON,You'll what?
178827,L200843,u5189,m343,WALTON,So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
178828,L200842,u5177,m343,ARCHER,They're too tight.
178829,L201246,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
178830,L201245,u5178,m343,BUZZ,"What's the matter with your voice, Commander?"
178831,L201244,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
178832,L201124,u5179,m343,CASTOR,I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.
178833,L201123,u5178,m343,BUZZ,What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
178834,L201122,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out."
178835,L201069,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Trust me, he's already here. Get going!"
178836,L201068,u5178,m343,BUZZ,SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
178837,L201223,u5183,m343,JAMIE,"Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though."
178838,L201222,u5179,m343,CASTOR,There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
178839,L201104,u5179,m343,CASTOR,I mean like protection.
178840,L201103,u5183,m343,JAMIE,You mean like ... condoms?
178841,L201102,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?"
178842,L201101,u5183,m343,JAMIE,You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
178843,L201100,u5179,m343,CASTOR,What are you -- stupid?
178844,L200984,u5183,m343,JAMIE,Like you know anything about it.
178845,L200983,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket."
178846,L200942,u5179,m343,CASTOR,You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
178847,L200941,u5183,m343,JAMIE,When did you start smoking?
178848,L200940,u5179,m343,CASTOR,I won't tell mom if you don't.
178849,L200939,u5183,m343,JAMIE,Clarissa left those here.
178850,L200937,u5183,m343,JAMIE,Janie?
178851,L200936,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want."
178852,L200968,u5184,m343,KIMBERLY,The Admiral?
178853,L200967,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Get rid of them.
178854,L200966,u5184,m343,KIMBERLY,You've got someone in your office.
178855,L200965,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?"
178856,L200964,u5184,m343,KIMBERLY,You always call me Miss Brewster.
178857,L200963,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"That's your name, isn't it?"
178858,L200962,u5184,m343,KIMBERLY,Kim?
178859,L200961,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Well, I saw you -- Kim."
178860,L200960,u5184,m343,KIMBERLY,Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
178861,L201248,u5179,m343,CASTOR,You can't blame me for trying.
178862,L201247,u5190,m343,WANDA,You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
178863,L201166,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
178864,L201165,u5190,m343,WANDA,It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
178865,L201164,u5179,m343,CASTOR,What?
178866,L201163,u5190,m343,WANDA,Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
178867,L201162,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
178868,L201161,u5190,m343,WANDA,"Commander, what are you doing here?"
178869,L201145,u5179,m343,CASTOR,What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
178870,L201144,u5190,m343,WANDA,What happened?
178871,L201067,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
178872,L201066,u5190,m343,WANDA,Castor's escaped!
178873,L201065,u5179,m343,CASTOR,What happened?
178874,L201064,u5190,m343,WANDA,You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
178875,L201072,u5186,m343,POLLUX,Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
178876,L201071,u5179,m343,CASTOR,A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
178877,L201070,u5186,m343,POLLUX,What about me?
178878,L201063,u5186,m343,POLLUX,No problem.
178879,L201062,u5179,m343,CASTOR,You'll need to recultivate that virus.
178880,L201061,u5186,m343,POLLUX,"Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ..."
178881,L201060,u5179,m343,CASTOR,All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
178882,L201059,u5186,m343,POLLUX,Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
178883,L201058,u5179,m343,CASTOR,We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
178884,L201055,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
178885,L201054,u5186,m343,POLLUX,Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
178886,L201053,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN."
178887,L201052,u5186,m343,POLLUX,I'm just having some fun.
178888,L201051,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small."
178889,L201050,u5186,m343,POLLUX,"Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled."
178890,L201049,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit."
178891,L201048,u5186,m343,POLLUX,"Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches."
178892,L200950,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...
178893,L200949,u5186,m343,POLLUX,"No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?"
178894,L200948,u5179,m343,CASTOR,-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
178895,L200946,u5179,m343,CASTOR,You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
178896,L200945,u5186,m343,POLLUX,I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
178897,L200944,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Business first.  I went into the ""Warrants"" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll."
178898,L200943,u5186,m343,POLLUX,You merciless bastard!
178899,L201156,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,"Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands."
178900,L201155,u5179,m343,CASTOR,No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
178901,L201154,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
178902,L201153,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here."
178903,L201152,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,"I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?"
178904,L200981,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,"Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations."
178905,L200980,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs."
178906,L200979,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,You'd have to start immediately.
178907,L200978,u5179,m343,CASTOR,I had doubts too.  I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
178908,L200977,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
178909,L200976,u5179,m343,CASTOR,What's that?
178910,L200975,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
178911,L200974,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Just following your example.
178912,L200973,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
178913,L200972,u5179,m343,CASTOR,You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
178914,L200970,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Normally, I would.  But today ..."
178915,L200969,u5185,m343,LAZARRO,"Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down."
178916,L201220,u5182,m343,EVE,Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
178917,L201219,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Back then -- who wasn't?
178918,L201218,u5182,m343,EVE,"Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna."
178919,L201214,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons."
178920,L201213,u5182,m343,EVE,I'm going to the powder room.
178921,L201212,u5182,m343,EVE,Good.  Because I'm fed up.
178922,L201211,u5179,m343,CASTOR,I'll deal with her later.
178923,L201210,u5182,m343,EVE,That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
178924,L201209,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Where's Jamie?
178925,L201181,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it."
178926,L201180,u5182,m343,EVE,-- Yes.
178927,L201179,u5179,m343,CASTOR,I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
178928,L201178,u5182,m343,EVE,Nothing.
178929,L201176,u5182,m343,EVE,-- Studying.
178930,L201175,u5179,m343,CASTOR,What are you doing?
178931,L201041,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ..."
178932,L201040,u5182,m343,EVE,"Yes, Jon.  That Karl."
178933,L201039,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Oh, that Karl."
178934,L201038,u5182,m343,EVE,Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
178935,L201037,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Great.
178936,L201036,u5182,m343,EVE,I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
178937,L201035,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive."
178938,L201034,u5182,m343,EVE,"The world can wait, Jon. You're going."
178939,L201033,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know."
178940,L201032,u5182,m343,EVE,"Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go."
178941,L201031,u5179,m343,CASTOR,What's on your mind?
178942,L201009,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Call me spontaneous.
178943,L201008,u5182,m343,EVE,You're wearing your suit --
178944,L201007,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ..."
178945,L201006,u5182,m343,EVE,... That's great.
178946,L201005,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted."
178947,L201004,u5182,m343,EVE,-- what?
178948,L201003,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
178949,L201002,u5182,m343,EVE,You always say that -- then you leave.
178950,L201001,u5179,m343,CASTOR,I'm not going anywhere.
178951,L201000,u5182,m343,EVE,"Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?"
178952,L200999,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Gone?
178953,L200998,u5182,m343,EVE,So -- how long will you be gone this time?
178954,L200996,u5182,m343,EVE,You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
178955,L200995,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
178956,L200994,u5182,m343,EVE,I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
178957,L200993,u5179,m343,CASTOR,They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
178958,L200992,u5182,m343,EVE,Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
178959,L200990,u5182,m343,EVE,-- I've got to study.
178960,L200989,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
178961,L200932,u5182,m343,EVE,No.
178962,L200931,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Don't I usually kiss my wife?
178963,L200930,u5182,m343,EVE,What is with you tonight?
178964,L200929,u5179,m343,CASTOR,Have fun at work.
178965,L200928,u5182,m343,EVE,Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
178966,L200927,u5179,m343,CASTOR,"The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha."
178967,L200926,u5182,m343,EVE,The hospital.
178968,L200925,u5179,m343,CASTOR,It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
178969,L200924,u5182,m343,EVE,As much as ever.  Nothing.
178970,L200923,u5179,m343,CASTOR,What do you know about it?
178971,L200922,u5182,m343,EVE,"What happened to your big ""assignment""?"
178972,L202936,u5192,m344,ADELLE,You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...
178973,L202935,u5200,m344,JACK,Adelle?
178974,L202934,u5192,m344,ADELLE,"Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here."
178975,L202933,u5200,m344,JACK,Hello?
178976,L202081,u5192,m344,ADELLE,That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
178977,L202080,u5200,m344,JACK,I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
178978,L202061,u5200,m344,JACK,"She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing."
178979,L202060,u5192,m344,ADELLE,No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
178980,L202059,u5200,m344,JACK,No...
178981,L202058,u5192,m344,ADELLE,And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
178982,L202057,u5200,m344,JACK,"I took the road less traveled, Adelle."
178983,L202056,u5192,m344,ADELLE,"Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy."
178984,L202055,u5200,m344,JACK,"God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight..."
178985,L202054,u5192,m344,ADELLE,So you left her?  Just like that?
178986,L202053,u5200,m344,JACK,She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
178987,L202052,u5192,m344,ADELLE,Excuse me?
178988,L202051,u5200,m344,JACK,Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
178989,L202050,u5192,m344,ADELLE,You?  Married?
178990,L202049,u5200,m344,JACK,Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
178991,L202048,u5192,m344,ADELLE,"Yeah Jack, her assistant..."
178992,L202047,u5200,m344,JACK,Her assistant?
178993,L202046,u5192,m344,ADELLE,Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
178994,L202045,u5200,m344,JACK,Kate Reynolds...
178995,L202044,u5200,m344,JACK,"Ooh, my suits are ready..."
178996,L202043,u5192,m344,ADELLE,"Oh, and Oxxford called..."
178997,L202042,u5192,m344,ADELLE,"You're a ray of sunshine, Jack."
178998,L202041,u5200,m344,JACK,"You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?"
178999,L202948,u5193,m344,ALAN,"So what are we gonna do, Jack?"
179000,L202947,u5200,m344,JACK,No.
179001,L202946,u5193,m344,ALAN,Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
179002,L202945,u5200,m344,JACK,But I think I like you better this way...
179003,L202944,u5193,m344,ALAN,Excuse me?
179004,L202942,u5193,m344,ALAN,"Its not good.  Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. Were not sure which one, Julias on it right now. Word is theyre willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  The Global people are up in arms.  They say we shouldve been prepared for this.  Were in trouble here, Jack..."
179005,L202941,u5200,m344,JACK,Whats going on here?
179006,L202940,u5193,m344,ALAN,"Jack, are you okay?"
179007,L202820,u5200,m344,JACK,"Oh, Im hearing you, Alan. Thats not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I dont care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office."
179008,L202819,u5193,m344,ALAN,I dont think youre hearing me.
179009,L202818,u5200,m344,JACK,Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
179010,L202813,u5200,m344,JACK,Seven.  Really.
179011,L202812,u5193,m344,ALAN,"...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile."
179012,L202799,u5200,m344,JACK,"You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch..."
179013,L202798,u5193,m344,ALAN,What about me?
179014,L202797,u5200,m344,JACK,"Take you, for instance..."
179015,L202795,u5193,m344,ALAN,Im sure you do...
179016,L202794,u5200,m344,JACK,And I know people.
179017,L202793,u5200,m344,JACK,"Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college.  Its just people..."
179018,L202792,u5193,m344,ALAN,"Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack."
179019,L202791,u5200,m344,JACK,"Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger..."
179020,L202789,u5193,m344,ALAN,"Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?"
179021,L202788,u5200,m344,JACK,"Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account."
179022,L202785,u5193,m344,ALAN,Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
179023,L202784,u5200,m344,JACK,We did one point seven million in total revenue...
179024,L202783,u5193,m344,ALAN,Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
179025,L202782,u5200,m344,JACK,Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
179026,L202781,u5193,m344,ALAN,"Uh huh. The retail end, I understand."
179027,L202780,u5200,m344,JACK,Thats right. And auto supply...
179028,L202779,u5193,m344,ALAN,A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
179029,L202778,u5200,m344,JACK,"I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton."
179030,L202775,u5200,m344,JACK,"Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones."
179031,L202774,u5193,m344,ALAN,"You have kids, Jack?"
179032,L202773,u5200,m344,JACK,"I can see that, Alan."
179033,L202772,u5193,m344,ALAN,"Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here..."
179034,L202771,u5200,m344,JACK,Mr. Mintz.
179035,L202038,u5200,m344,JACK,Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
179036,L202037,u5193,m344,ALAN,Why Jack?
179037,L202036,u5200,m344,JACK,"I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?"
179038,L202035,u5193,m344,ALAN,"You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan."
179039,L202032,u5193,m344,ALAN,I don't know.  Maybe...
179040,L202031,u5200,m344,JACK,"You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?"
179041,L202030,u5200,m344,JACK,Is that tonight?
179042,L202029,u5193,m344,ALAN,"Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all."
179043,L202661,u5194,m344,ANNIE,"Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways..."
179044,L202660,u5201,m344,KATE,"Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?"
179045,L202486,u5201,m344,KATE,"Thats right.  Okay, lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then Ill run into the linen store..."
179046,L202485,u5194,m344,ANNIE,"Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised."
179047,L202484,u5201,m344,KATE,Were almost done here...
179048,L202149,u5201,m344,KATE,Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
179049,L202148,u5194,m344,ANNIE,"Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?"
179050,L202147,u5201,m344,KATE,"Youre jumping, sweetheart..."
179051,L202146,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Rise...and...shine...!
179052,L202888,u5200,m344,JACK,"No, honey. Go back to sleep."
179053,L202887,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Is it morning yet?
179054,L202867,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Ringing my bell...
179055,L202866,u5200,m344,JACK,What are you doing?
179056,L202855,u5200,m344,JACK,Ah. A classic...
179057,L202854,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Mary Had A Little Lamb.
179058,L202853,u5200,m344,JACK,Very nice. What is it?
179059,L202655,u5200,m344,JACK,"Right.  Thats a major oversight...  So if Im Kate...I cant really afford the finer things, my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me, Im trapped in suburbia..."
179060,L202654,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
179061,L202653,u5200,m344,JACK,Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
179062,L202652,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Mom liked it.
179063,L202651,u5200,m344,JACK,Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
179064,L202650,u5194,m344,ANNIE,One year he had a solar system named after her...
179065,L202649,u5200,m344,JACK,Like what?
179066,L202648,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
179067,L202394,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Thats where you work.
179068,L202393,u5200,m344,JACK,Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
179069,L202392,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Big Eds.
179070,L202391,u5200,m344,JACK,Where do I go now?
179071,L202389,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Bye...
179072,L202388,u5200,m344,JACK,Got it.  Good tip.
179073,L202387,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
179074,L202386,u5200,m344,JACK,Five thirty.  Okay.
179075,L202385,u5194,m344,ANNIE,"I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty."
179076,L202383,u5200,m344,JACK,Check...
179077,L202382,u5194,m344,ANNIE,This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
179078,L202379,u5200,m344,JACK,Sure.
179079,L202378,u5194,m344,ANNIE,You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
179080,L202377,u5200,m344,JACK,I think I could figure it out.
179081,L202376,u5194,m344,ANNIE,You know how to make chocolate milk?
179082,L202375,u5200,m344,JACK,On a case by case basis...
179083,L202374,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Do you like kids?
179084,L202372,u5200,m344,JACK,"Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?"
179085,L202371,u5194,m344,ANNIE,The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
179086,L202370,u5200,m344,JACK,Who did?
179087,L202369,u5194,m344,ANNIE,They did a pretty good job.
179088,L202367,u5200,m344,JACK,I dont know...
179089,L202366,u5194,m344,ANNIE,Wheres my real dad?
179090,L202365,u5200,m344,JACK,This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
179091,L202932,u5200,m344,JACK,"Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends..."
179092,L202931,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man..."
179093,L202930,u5200,m344,JACK,"Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together."
179094,L202929,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well..."
179095,L202928,u5200,m344,JACK,Yes...Jack Campbell...
179096,L202927,u5195,m344,ARNIE,Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
179097,L202926,u5195,m344,ARNIE,I never won anything in bowling.
179098,L202925,u5200,m344,JACK,We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
179099,L202924,u5195,m344,ARNIE,Howd you know my name?
179100,L202923,u5200,m344,JACK,"Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please..."
179101,L202922,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here."
179102,L202921,u5200,m344,JACK,"Its me, Jack..."
179103,L202920,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"Hey, you cant park that thing here."
179104,L202611,u5200,m344,JACK,Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
179105,L202610,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?"
179106,L202578,u5195,m344,ARNIE,All Im saying it there isnt a guy in Union County who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to Kate...
179107,L202577,u5200,m344,JACK,"Hey, is that really necessary?"
179108,L202576,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer."
179109,L202575,u5195,m344,ARNIE,Screw the rules.  Im talking about the choice.
179110,L202574,u5200,m344,JACK,"Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn."
179111,L202573,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever."
179112,L202572,u5200,m344,JACK,It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
179113,L202571,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?"
179114,L202570,u5200,m344,JACK,So could you write down her exact address?
179115,L202569,u5195,m344,ARNIE,Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
179116,L202568,u5200,m344,JACK,Pretty much.
179117,L202567,u5195,m344,ARNIE,She said that?
179118,L202566,u5200,m344,JACK,She wants to have an affair with me.
179119,L202565,u5195,m344,ARNIE,She is relentless.
179120,L202564,u5200,m344,JACK,I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
179121,L202563,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you."
179122,L202539,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"Youre right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare..."
179123,L202538,u5200,m344,JACK,"Hey, Im doing the best I can...  Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers..."
179124,L202537,u5195,m344,ARNIE,Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?
179125,L202536,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!"
179126,L202535,u5200,m344,JACK,Damn...
179127,L202256,u5200,m344,JACK,"Its just two kids, right?"
179128,L202255,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have..."
179129,L202252,u5200,m344,JACK,Kates my wife...
179130,L202251,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"You see, its like were in each others heads..."
179131,L202250,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"Its not Kate, is it?"
179132,L202249,u5200,m344,JACK,I dont think so.
179133,L202248,u5195,m344,ARNIE,Trouble at work?
179134,L202247,u5200,m344,JACK,Is it...?
179135,L202246,u5195,m344,ARNIE,"What am I saying?  You dont need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  Is that you?"
179136,L202245,u5195,m344,ARNIE,I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
179137,L202244,u5200,m344,JACK,Im having kind of a bad day.
179138,L202242,u5195,m344,ARNIE,Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
179139,L202241,u5200,m344,JACK,"Were friends, arent we?"

179231,L202553,u5200,m344,JACK,Is there something going on between us?
179232,L202552,u5198,m344,EVELYN,"Are we what, Jack?"

179237,L202545,u5198,m344,EVELYN,Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
179238,L202544,u5200,m344,JACK,"Evelyn, right?"
179239,L202321,u5200,m344,JACK,"Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me..."

179242,L202315,u5200,m344,JACK,"I dont think so, thank you..."
179243,L202314,u5198,m344,EVELYN,Finger food...?
179244,L202304,u5198,m344,EVELYN,I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.

179262,L202419,u5200,m344,JACK,"Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here..."

179286,L202994,u5200,m344,JACK,You cant go!
179287,L202982,u5200,m344,JACK,Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
179288,L202981,u5201,m344,KATE,"No, Jack, I never got married. You?"

179307,L202898,u5201,m344,KATE,"I promise, Jack..."
179308,L202897,u5200,m344,JACK,"Please, just promise me youll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you dont, then its like it never happened and I dont think I could live with that."
179309,L202896,u5201,m344,KATE,"Are you okay, Jack?"
179310,L202895,u5200,m344,JACK,"I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens."

179313,L202892,u5201,m344,KATE,"Its been interesting, thats for sure."
179314,L202851,u5200,m344,JACK,"Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy."
179315,L202850,u5201,m344,KATE,Dont do that...
179316,L202848,u5201,m344,KATE,Then get a goddamn snow blower!

179319,L202842,u5200,m344,JACK,"No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon."
179320,L202841,u5201,m344,KATE,I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
179321,L202840,u5200,m344,JACK,"This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here..."
179322,L202839,u5201,m344,KATE,"Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?"
179323,L202838,u5200,m344,JACK,"Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate..."
179324,L202837,u5201,m344,KATE,Annie goes to a great school.
179325,L202836,u5200,m344,JACK,"I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools..."
179326,L202835,u5201,m344,KATE,Are you out of your mind?
179327,L202832,u5201,m344,KATE,"What are you talking about, Jack?"
179328,L202831,u5200,m344,JACK,Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
179329,L202830,u5200,m344,JACK,A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
179330,L202829,u5201,m344,KATE,A perk for what?
179331,L202828,u5200,m344,JACK,"This place is a perk, Kate."
179332,L202827,u5201,m344,KATE,For the week?
179333,L202826,u5200,m344,JACK,Think bigger.
179334,L202825,u5201,m344,KATE,"So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?"
179335,L202824,u5201,m344,KATE,Its like a museum.
179336,L202823,u5200,m344,JACK,"Pretty incredible, isnt it?"
179337,L202734,u5200,m344,JACK,I dont think Id fight you on that one...
179338,L202733,u5201,m344,KATE,I could stay here forever...
179339,L202729,u5201,m344,KATE,Thats all I wanted to hear...
179340,L202728,u5200,m344,JACK,"My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you..."
179341,L202727,u5201,m344,KATE,"I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack..."
179342,L202726,u5200,m344,JACK,Youre so...beautiful...
179343,L202724,u5201,m344,KATE,Way out...
179344,L202723,u5200,m344,JACK,Im out of the doghouse?
179345,L202722,u5201,m344,KATE,"I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off."
179346,L202721,u5200,m344,JACK,"Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart."
179347,L202720,u5201,m344,KATE,You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
179348,L202717,u5201,m344,KATE,What are you sure about?
179349,L202716,u5200,m344,JACK,Good things...
179350,L202712,u5200,m344,JACK,Its wonderful...
179351,L202711,u5201,m344,KATE,Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
179352,L202710,u5201,m344,KATE,"God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player..."
179353,L202709,u5200,m344,JACK,I guess...some of them are probably faking.
179354,L202708,u5201,m344,KATE,"I mean yes, I help people that need it..."
179355,L202707,u5200,m344,JACK,Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
179356,L202706,u5201,m344,KATE,"My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check."
179357,L202705,u5200,m344,JACK,"Thats a big one for me, too."
179358,L202704,u5201,m344,KATE,"Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey..."
179359,L202703,u5200,m344,JACK,But you always seem so certain.
179360,L202702,u5201,m344,KATE,I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
179361,L202700,u5200,m344,JACK,Now...I dont...
179362,L202699,u5201,m344,KATE,And now...?
179363,L202698,u5200,m344,JACK,"I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets."
179364,L202697,u5200,m344,JACK,"No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different..."
179365,L202696,u5201,m344,KATE,"Worse, you mean..."
179366,L202695,u5200,m344,JACK,"I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different..."
179367,L202693,u5200,m344,JACK,Are you sure?
179368,L202692,u5201,m344,KATE,Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
179369,L202691,u5200,m344,JACK,I think it may help us but theres a slight chance it could make things worse.
179370,L202690,u5201,m344,KATE,Okay...
179371,L202689,u5200,m344,JACK,I need to tell you something.
179372,L202680,u5200,m344,JACK,"But Im gettin close, right?"
179373,L202679,u5201,m344,KATE,"You are so not off the hook yet, slick."
179374,L202672,u5201,m344,KATE,How do you even know about this place?
179375,L202671,u5200,m344,JACK,"Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs..."
179376,L202670,u5201,m344,KATE,Jack...can we afford all this?
179377,L202641,u5200,m344,JACK,Ill fix it.  Ill go out right now and get you something.  Ill make it right.
179378,L202640,u5201,m344,KATE,You actually forgot our anniversary.
179379,L202638,u5200,m344,JACK,"I know that, but..."
179380,L202637,u5201,m344,KATE,What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
179381,L202636,u5200,m344,JACK,"Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day..."
179382,L202634,u5201,m344,KATE,"Enjoy it, sweetheart..."
179383,L202633,u5200,m344,JACK,You really are incredible...
179384,L202632,u5200,m344,JACK,Zeena...
179385,L202631,u5201,m344,KATE,"I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you..."
179386,L202630,u5201,m344,KATE,"No, open it..."
179387,L202629,u5200,m344,JACK,Maybe I should wait...
179388,L202613,u5200,m344,JACK,Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?
179389,L202612,u5201,m344,KATE,Jack.
179390,L202604,u5200,m344,JACK,What? You make me hot...
179391,L202603,u5201,m344,KATE,"Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet."
179392,L202602,u5200,m344,JACK,Not it...?
179393,L202600,u5200,m344,JACK,"Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place..."
179394,L202599,u5201,m344,KATE,Then say it...just say it to me...!
179395,L202598,u5200,m344,JACK,"Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear..."
179396,L202597,u5201,m344,KATE,"Cmon, you know what I like to hear..."
179397,L202596,u5200,m344,JACK,What...?
179398,L202595,u5201,m344,KATE,"Say it, Jack..."
179399,L202593,u5201,m344,KATE,"Its good, right?"
179400,L202592,u5200,m344,JACK,Thank you...
179401,L202591,u5200,m344,JACK,I want it...
179402,L202590,u5201,m344,KATE,You want the cake!?
179403,L202588,u5201,m344,KATE,"Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me."
179404,L202587,u5200,m344,JACK,Cmon.
179405,L202583,u5200,m344,JACK,Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
179406,L202582,u5201,m344,KATE,You mean this chocolate cake?
179407,L202581,u5200,m344,JACK,"Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?"
179408,L202580,u5201,m344,KATE,"How was the game, honey?"
179409,L202533,u5200,m344,JACK,How would you look at it?
179410,L202532,u5201,m344,KATE,If you want to look at it that way...
179411,L202531,u5200,m344,JACK,Our life in a nutshell...
179412,L202528,u5200,m344,JACK,Thats why I work for Big Ed?
179413,L202527,u5201,m344,KATE,"Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store."
179414,L202526,u5200,m344,JACK,You had a heart attack?
179415,L202525,u5201,m344,KATE,The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
179416,L202524,u5201,m344,KATE,You cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
179417,L202523,u5200,m344,JACK,Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
179418,L202522,u5201,m344,KATE,We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
179419,L202521,u5200,m344,JACK,"No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?"
179420,L202520,u5201,m344,KATE,"Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her."
179421,L202519,u5200,m344,JACK,Sure.  I really like Annie.
179422,L202518,u5201,m344,KATE,"I think it worked out okay, dont you?"
179423,L202517,u5200,m344,JACK,"Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?"
179424,L202516,u5201,m344,KATE,Well...Annie for one.
179425,L202510,u5201,m344,KATE,"Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund."
179426,L202509,u5200,m344,JACK,"Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married..."
179427,L202507,u5200,m344,JACK,"I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!"
179428,L202506,u5201,m344,KATE,"Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack."
179429,L202505,u5200,m344,JACK,Whats in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
179430,L202504,u5201,m344,KATE,Really.
179431,L202503,u5200,m344,JACK,"I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it."
179432,L202502,u5200,m344,JACK,"I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate."
179433,L202501,u5201,m344,KATE,Excuse me?
179434,L202500,u5200,m344,JACK,Do you have any idea what my life is like?
179435,L202499,u5201,m344,KATE,No?
179436,L202497,u5201,m344,KATE,"Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  Cmon, take it off.  Well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like."
179437,L202496,u5200,m344,JACK,She got those shoes...
179438,L202495,u5201,m344,KATE,"$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?"
179439,L202494,u5200,m344,JACK,Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...
179440,L202493,u5201,m344,KATE,I mean...wow...off the charts great.
179441,L202481,u5201,m344,KATE,Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
179442,L202480,u5200,m344,JACK,Do what?
179443,L202479,u5201,m344,KATE,How can you do that?
179444,L202478,u5200,m344,JACK,"I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman..."
179445,L202477,u5201,m344,KATE,"This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming..."
179446,L202476,u5200,m344,JACK,"No, Im serious...youre really stunning..."
179447,L202475,u5201,m344,KATE,"Thanks, Jack..."
179448,L202473,u5200,m344,JACK,Whatever you say...honey.
179449,L202472,u5201,m344,KATE,"Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining."
179450,L202471,u5200,m344,JACK,Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
179451,L202470,u5201,m344,KATE,"That is the general idea, yes..."
179452,L202469,u5200,m344,JACK,"Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?"
179453,L202467,u5200,m344,JACK,Im working on a new deal now...
179454,L202466,u5201,m344,KATE,I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
179455,L202465,u5200,m344,JACK,Hey!  I was watching that!
179456,L202464,u5200,m344,JACK,Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
179457,L202463,u5201,m344,KATE,Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
179458,L202356,u5201,m344,KATE,And...?
179459,L202355,u5200,m344,JACK,Uh...that babys crying...
179460,L202354,u5200,m344,JACK,HEY!
179461,L202353,u5201,m344,KATE,...my feet are hurtin...
179462,L202352,u5200,m344,JACK,Hello!
179463,L202342,u5201,m344,KATE,"Youre having a bad day, Ill go with you...actually, theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there..."
179464,L202341,u5200,m344,JACK,But its twenty degrees outside...
179465,L202340,u5201,m344,KATE,"Fine, shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her."
179466,L202339,u5200,m344,JACK,"No, shes not."
179467,L202338,u5201,m344,KATE,"Shes your dog, Jack."
179468,L202337,u5200,m344,JACK,Youre kidding me...
179469,L202336,u5201,m344,KATE,Here you go...
179470,L202334,u5200,m344,JACK,"Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo..."
179471,L202333,u5201,m344,KATE,Jack...
179472,L202327,u5201,m344,KATE,Uh huh...
179473,L202326,u5200,m344,JACK,"Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!"
179474,L202299,u5201,m344,KATE,"Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside."
179475,L202298,u5200,m344,JACK,Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
179476,L202296,u5201,m344,KATE,Because youll be here.
179477,L202295,u5200,m344,JACK,Why not?
179478,L202294,u5201,m344,KATE,Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
179479,L202293,u5200,m344,JACK,What are you doing?
179480,L202291,u5200,m344,JACK,Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
179481,L202290,u5201,m344,KATE,You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
179482,L202289,u5200,m344,JACK,"Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party..."
179483,L202288,u5201,m344,KATE,"Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is..."
179484,L202279,u5200,m344,JACK,"Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house..."
179485,L202278,u5201,m344,KATE,Jack...dont even start...
179486,L202277,u5200,m344,JACK,Because thats where I live.
179487,L202276,u5201,m344,KATE,The city?  New York City?  Why?
179488,L202275,u5200,m344,JACK,I was in the city.
179489,L202274,u5201,m344,KATE,Where were you?
179490,L202273,u5200,m344,JACK,I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
179491,L202272,u5201,m344,KATE,What kind of man does that!?
179492,L202268,u5200,m344,JACK,Yeah...fine.
179493,L202267,u5201,m344,KATE,Are you okay?
179494,L201993,u5200,m344,JACK,You hear me complaining about that?
179495,L201992,u5201,m344,KATE,I can't seem to let go of you...
179496,L201989,u5201,m344,KATE,We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
179497,L201988,u5200,m344,JACK,"No, youre right.  What are we doing?"
179498,L201987,u5201,m344,KATE,"Go. Im sorry, you should just go..."
179499,L201986,u5200,m344,JACK,What?
179500,L201985,u5201,m344,KATE,"Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane..."

179504,L201981,u5201,m344,KATE,"Dont  go, Jack..."
179505,L201980,u5201,m344,KATE,I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
179506,L201979,u5200,m344,JACK,About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
179507,L201978,u5201,m344,KATE,I have a bad feeling about this.
179508,L201972,u5201,m344,KATE,I also put side two of London Calling on there...
179509,L201971,u5200,m344,JACK,All in one tape?
179510,L201970,u5201,m344,KATE,Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...

179512,L202179,u5206,m344,MRS. PETERSON,"And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city."

179514,L202177,u5206,m344,MRS. PETERSON,No...

179516,L202021,u5200,m344,JACK,"Its because Im shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?"
179517,L202020,u5206,m344,MRS. PETERSON,Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
179518,L202019,u5200,m344,JACK,Mrs. Peterson.
179519,L202805,u5200,m344,JACK,"Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. Youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand..."
179520,L202804,u5203,m344,LASSITER,Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
179521,L202803,u5200,m344,JACK,"For one thing, you like expensive things."
179522,L202802,u5200,m344,JACK,"Youre a little tougher, Peter."
179523,L202801,u5203,m344,LASSITER,"He certainly has your number, Alan."
179524,L202767,u5200,m344,JACK,But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
179525,L202766,u5203,m344,LASSITER,"...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see..."
179526,L202753,u5200,m344,JACK,Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
179527,L202752,u5203,m344,LASSITER,Do I know you?
179528,L202751,u5200,m344,JACK,Peter Lassiter...
179529,L202079,u5203,m344,LASSITER,Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
179530,L202078,u5200,m344,JACK,Not by a long shot.
179531,L202077,u5203,m344,LASSITER,You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
179532,L202076,u5200,m344,JACK,"Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve..."
179533,L202073,u5203,m344,LASSITER,Aspen.
179534,L202072,u5200,m344,JACK,Where is he?

179536,L202070,u5200,m344,JACK,"Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?"
179537,L202069,u5203,m344,LASSITER,Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
179538,L202068,u5200,m344,JACK,That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
179539,L202067,u5203,m344,LASSITER,I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
179540,L202066,u5200,m344,JACK,And God love you for it.
179541,L202065,u5203,m344,LASSITER,That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
179542,L202064,u5200,m344,JACK,Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
179543,L202919,u5200,m344,JACK,"Im sorry, no..."

179549,L202913,u5205,m344,MAN,"Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?"
179550,L202912,u5200,m344,JACK,Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
179551,L202911,u5205,m344,MAN,Can I help you?
179552,L202738,u5200,m344,JACK,You wont regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/As...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...

179571,L202004,u5200,m344,JACK,You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
179572,L202003,u5207,m344,PAULA,Last night was great...
179573,L202002,u5200,m344,JACK,Of course I did.
179574,L202001,u5207,m344,PAULA,Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
179575,L202986,u5204,m344,LORI,Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
179576,L202985,u5201,m344,KATE,I found it!

179579,L202973,u5204,m344,LORI,Maybe its by the wardrobe boxes...
179580,L202972,u5201,m344,KATE,You didnt seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
179581,L202971,u5204,m344,LORI,"Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here."

179583,L202969,u5204,m344,LORI,Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
179584,L204598,u5210,m345,ALICIA,"Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?"

179586,L204596,u5210,m345,ALICIA,I wouldn't know anything about that.
179587,L204595,u5219,m345,THE THING,"You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --"
179588,L204593,u5219,m345,THE THING,This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
179589,L204592,u5210,m345,ALICIA,"""Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."""

179591,L204797,u5211,m345,BEN,I like the sound of that.
179592,L204796,u5210,m345,ALICIA,We're going to have to work on your touch.
179593,L204590,u5210,m345,ALICIA,My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
179594,L204589,u5211,m345,BEN,Those yours too?
179595,L204588,u5211,m345,BEN,"No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty..."
179596,L204587,u5210,m345,ALICIA,"Relax, it's casual."
179597,L204586,u5211,m345,BEN,I'm not really dressed for a party.
179598,L204585,u5210,m345,ALICIA,"I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?"
179599,L204584,u5211,m345,BEN,How'd you know it was me?
179600,L204457,u5211,m345,BEN,"Trust me, this ain't one of those times."
179601,L204456,u5210,m345,ALICIA,"Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing."
179602,L204453,u5211,m345,BEN,"You wouldn't say that, if you could see me."
179603,L204452,u5210,m345,ALICIA,I don't think She's real big on hate.
179604,L204794,u5211,m345,BEN,"Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is."
179605,L204793,u5216,m345,REED,"Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings..."
179606,L204784,u5211,m345,BEN,"Got it, teach."
179607,L204783,u5216,m345,REED,"Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben..."
179608,L204650,u5216,m345,REED,"Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--"

179613,L204644,u5216,m345,REED,Ben --
179614,L204525,u5216,m345,REED,"This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again."
179615,L204524,u5211,m345,BEN,It's about to be a broken face.
179616,L204363,u5216,m345,REED,O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
179617,L204362,u5211,m345,BEN,Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
179618,L204361,u5216,m345,REED,"Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --"
179619,L204360,u5211,m345,BEN,Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
179620,L204359,u5216,m345,REED,"Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal..."
179621,L204343,u5216,m345,REED,"If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes."

179623,L204308,u5211,m345,BEN,"Yeah, nine years straight."
179624,L204307,u5216,m345,REED,We had a tough year.
179625,L204263,u5211,m345,BEN,Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!

179628,L204165,u5211,m345,BEN,I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
179629,L204164,u5216,m345,REED,Are you alright?
179630,L204137,u5211,m345,BEN,Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
179631,L204136,u5216,m345,REED,"He's smart, powerful, successful --"
179632,L204135,u5211,m345,BEN,"I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?"
179633,L204134,u5216,m345,REED,What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
179634,L204133,u5211,m345,BEN,"Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie."
179635,L204132,u5216,m345,REED,"Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --"
179636,L204131,u5211,m345,BEN,"You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life."
179637,L204129,u5216,m345,REED,"I should have done more, run more tests --"
179638,L204128,u5211,m345,BEN,Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
179639,L204127,u5216,m345,REED,I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
179640,L204125,u5211,m345,BEN,Solid.
179641,L204124,u5216,m345,REED,Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
179642,L204123,u5211,m345,BEN,How long was I out?
179643,L204059,u5216,m345,REED,Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
179644,L204058,u5211,m345,BEN,"I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead."
179645,L204025,u5211,m345,BEN,<u>Should</u>?
179646,L204024,u5216,m345,REED,The shields on the station should protect us.
179647,L204005,u5216,m345,REED,Victor's better at these things.
179648,L204004,u5211,m345,BEN,"This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there."
179649,L204003,u5216,m345,REED,He's made a few changes.
179650,L204002,u5211,m345,BEN,Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
179651,L203982,u5211,m345,BEN,This makes five.
179652,L203981,u5216,m345,REED,I had it at four.
179653,L203980,u5211,m345,BEN,Five times.
179654,L203979,u5216,m345,REED,When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
179655,L203978,u5216,m345,REED,I'm sure he's matured since then.
179656,L203977,u5211,m345,BEN,They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
179657,L203976,u5216,m345,REED,Youthful high spirits.
179658,L203975,u5211,m345,BEN,No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
179659,L203974,u5216,m345,REED,"External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --"
179660,L203973,u5211,m345,BEN,Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
179661,L203961,u5211,m345,BEN,"I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what <u>he</u> wants... Speaking of which..."
179662,L203960,u5216,m345,REED,We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
179663,L203959,u5211,m345,BEN,Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
179664,L203958,u5216,m345,REED,"Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --"
179665,L203957,u5211,m345,BEN,He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
179666,L203948,u5216,m345,REED,"Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>."
179667,L203947,u5211,m345,BEN,What about his first born?
179668,L203933,u5216,m345,REED,Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
179669,L203932,u5211,m345,BEN,I can't take this.
179670,L203917,u5211,m345,BEN,You'd never know it.
179671,L203916,u5216,m345,REED,He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
179672,L203915,u5216,m345,REED,"This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life."
179673,L203914,u5211,m345,BEN,"Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --"
179674,L204807,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through."
179675,L204806,u5211,m345,BEN,No more cracks about how I look.
179676,L204724,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
179677,L204723,u5211,m345,BEN,The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
179678,L204661,u5211,m345,BEN,Go back to the drawing board.
179679,L204660,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!

179681,L204090,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --"
179682,L204089,u5211,m345,BEN,Give me a mirror...
179683,L204088,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --"
179684,L204087,u5211,m345,BEN,What's wrong with me?
179685,L204086,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
179686,L204085,u5211,m345,BEN,Reed? ... Sue?
179687,L204084,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
179688,L204083,u5211,m345,BEN,Where...where am I?
179689,L204039,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Don't you wander off, boy."
179690,L204038,u5211,m345,BEN,Put your tiny little mind at ease.
179691,L204037,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up."
179692,L204036,u5211,m345,BEN,"Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either."
179693,L204035,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Yeah, well, his eyes say different."
179694,L204034,u5211,m345,BEN,'Course not.  Strictly business.
179695,L204033,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
179696,L204017,u5211,m345,BEN,"Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time."
179697,L204016,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive."
179698,L204011,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look."
179699,L204010,u5211,m345,BEN,"What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --"
179700,L204441,u5211,m345,BEN,I already got it.  Everything I want.
179701,L204440,u5212,m345,DEBBIE,"What did you wish for, honey?"
179702,L204225,u5211,m345,BEN,"Deb, it's me.  It's still me."
179703,L204224,u5212,m345,DEBBIE,Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
179704,L204223,u5212,m345,DEBBIE,"Baby, you're scaring me."
179705,L204222,u5211,m345,BEN,"Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said ""together forever no matter what""?"
179706,L204221,u5212,m345,DEBBIE,Ben?
179707,L204219,u5212,m345,DEBBIE,"Out front?  You home, baby?  I got a surprise for you."
179708,L204218,u5211,m345,BEN,Deb... It's me.  I need you to step out front.
179709,L204009,u5212,m345,DEBBIE,"I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man."
179710,L204008,u5211,m345,BEN,"Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock."
179711,L204007,u5212,m345,DEBBIE,"Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom."
179712,L204006,u5211,m345,BEN,I'll be watching over you.
179713,L204694,u5211,m345,BEN,And you can?  Power it up?
179714,L204693,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for ""Mr. Fantastic."""
179715,L204692,u5220,m345,VICTOR,He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
179716,L204691,u5211,m345,BEN,Reed said it'd be weeks till --
179717,L204690,u5220,m345,VICTOR,To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
179718,L204689,u5211,m345,BEN,"What do you want, Vic?"
179719,L204686,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
179720,L204685,u5211,m345,BEN,What is this?  Where's Reed?
179721,L204684,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Ben, come in."
179722,L204634,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Come on.  Let me buy you something to eat.  Looks like you could use the company.
179723,L204633,u5211,m345,BEN,About me?  How sweet.
179724,L204632,u5220,m345,VICTOR,I'm worried about you.
179725,L204631,u5211,m345,BEN,What are <u>you</u> doing here?
179726,L204726,u5211,m345,BEN,Victor must've taken him.
179727,L204725,u5218,m345,SUE,<u>Where is Reed</u>?
179728,L204543,u5218,m345,SUE,"No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben."
179729,L204542,u5211,m345,BEN,It's easy for you to be patient.
179730,L204541,u5218,m345,SUE,Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
179731,L204540,u5211,m345,BEN,It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
179732,L204539,u5218,m345,SUE,He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
179733,L204500,u5218,m345,SUE,<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
179734,L204499,u5211,m345,BEN,"Oh, he did."
179735,L204498,u5218,m345,SUE,He didn't.
179736,L204396,u5211,m345,BEN,I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
179737,L204395,u5218,m345,SUE,The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
179738,L204394,u5211,m345,BEN,You look like an eighties rock band.
179739,L204345,u5211,m345,BEN,Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
179740,L204344,u5218,m345,SUE,"We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped."
179741,L204160,u5211,m345,BEN,Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
179742,L204159,u5218,m345,SUE,"I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor."
179743,L204023,u5211,m345,BEN,Is it safe?
179744,L204022,u5218,m345,SUE,We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
179745,L203986,u5218,m345,SUE,Victor did.
179746,L203985,u5211,m345,BEN,I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
179747,L203968,u5218,m345,SUE,I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
179748,L203967,u5211,m345,BEN,Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
179749,L204414,u5220,m345,VICTOR,That's terrible news...
179750,L204413,u5213,m345,DOCTOR,But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
179751,L204411,u5213,m345,DOCTOR,The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
179752,L204410,u5220,m345,VICTOR,What?
179753,L204409,u5213,m345,DOCTOR,I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
179754,L204408,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"What do you mean ""complete""?"
179755,L204407,u5213,m345,DOCTOR,"At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --"
179756,L204406,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
179757,L204405,u5213,m345,DOCTOR,I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
179758,L204404,u5220,m345,VICTOR,And they're changing into...
179759,L204403,u5213,m345,DOCTOR,"Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --"
179760,L204778,u5216,m345,REED,<u>Now</u>.
179761,L204777,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,But all these people...
179762,L204776,u5216,m345,REED,Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
179763,L204535,u5216,m345,REED,A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
179764,L204534,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?"
179765,L204533,u5216,m345,REED,You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
179766,L204445,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Right, whatever, have fun."
179767,L204444,u5216,m345,REED,"That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --"
179768,L204398,u5216,m345,REED,They're not costumes.
179769,L204397,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
179770,L204367,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're...well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?"
179771,L204366,u5216,m345,REED,What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
179772,L204365,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
179773,L204364,u5216,m345,REED,"Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --"
179774,L204357,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
179775,L204356,u5216,m345,REED,"Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it."
179776,L204351,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,I can go hotter!
179777,L204350,u5216,m345,REED,"Back it down, Johnny!"
179778,L204321,u5216,m345,REED,...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
179779,L204320,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
179780,L204319,u5216,m345,REED,We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
179781,L204310,u5216,m345,REED,"Oh, it is."
179782,L204309,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
179783,L204288,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
179784,L204287,u5216,m345,REED,Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
179785,L204255,u5216,m345,REED,You've been working out.
179786,L204254,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,This is wrong in so many ways.
179787,L204199,u5216,m345,REED,"Ben, are you there?"
179788,L204198,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!"
179789,L204190,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
179790,L204189,u5216,m345,REED,The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
179791,L204188,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Now what is up with <i>that</i>?
179792,L204081,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Ben!  Ben!
179793,L204080,u5216,m345,REED,He's not responsive --
179794,L204074,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,What about you?
179795,L204073,u5216,m345,REED,"Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields."
179796,L204146,u5217,m345,SEXY NURSE,No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
179797,L204145,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Not this again --
179798,L204144,u5217,m345,SEXY NURSE,You're on fire!
179799,L204143,u5217,m345,SEXY NURSE,Last one down springs for room service.
179800,L204142,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,I though we went over this.
179801,L204141,u5217,m345,SEXY NURSE,Stay right.  Left is trouble.
179802,L204140,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Me like-y.
179803,L204122,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up."
179804,L204121,u5217,m345,SEXY NURSE,"My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --"
179805,L204120,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
179806,L204119,u5217,m345,SEXY NURSE,"I mean, you feel a little feverish."
179807,L204118,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,So are you!
179808,L204117,u5217,m345,SEXY NURSE,You're hot!
179809,L204109,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"I don't know if ""we've"" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --"
179810,L204108,u5217,m345,SEXY NURSE,And where do we think we're going?
179811,L204736,u5218,m345,SUE,But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
179812,L204735,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
179813,L204734,u5218,m345,SUE,What are you doing --
179814,L204721,u5218,m345,SUE,"No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out."
179815,L204720,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --"
179816,L204668,u5218,m345,SUE,"As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them."
179817,L204667,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --"
179818,L204666,u5218,m345,SUE,"Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --"
179819,L204665,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
179820,L204664,u5218,m345,SUE,"Is that what you call it?  ""<i>Real</i>""?"
179821,L204663,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world."
179822,L204662,u5218,m345,SUE,Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
179823,L204531,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Blockhead started it!
179824,L204530,u5218,m345,SUE,You two need a time-out.
179825,L204523,u5218,m345,SUE,"You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the ""face"" of the Fantastic Four now?"
179826,L204522,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!"
179827,L204519,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Dude.  That's my sister.
179828,L204518,u5218,m345,SUE,I'm driving.
179829,L204506,u5218,m345,SUE,<u>Girl</u>...?!
179830,L204505,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl."
179831,L204355,u5218,m345,SUE,That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
179832,L204354,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Sweet.
179833,L204353,u5218,m345,SUE,"You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --"
179834,L204352,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,You're really cramping my style here.
179835,L204318,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool."
179836,L204317,u5218,m345,SUE,"Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?"
179837,L204316,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
179838,L204205,u5218,m345,SUE,I think that thing is Ben.
179839,L204204,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,What is that <i>thing</i>?
179840,L204197,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Okay, ""mom."""
179841,L204196,u5218,m345,SUE,Stop it.
179842,L204195,u5218,m345,SUE,Johnny.
179843,L204194,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --"
179844,L204192,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
179845,L204191,u5218,m345,SUE,Apparently I can disappear.
179846,L203988,u5214,m345,JOHNNY,"Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!"
179847,L203987,u5218,m345,SUE,"The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --"
179848,L204231,u5215,m345,LEONARD,"Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington."
179849,L204230,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Front page?
179850,L204229,u5215,m345,LEONARD,"Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --"
179851,L204228,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press."
179852,L204158,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"<u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar ""why England,"" he said, ""because it's not <u>mine</u>."""
179853,L204157,u5215,m345,LEONARD,"Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --"
179854,L204156,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing..."
179855,L204155,u5215,m345,LEONARD,"You know, maybe you should get some rest --"
179856,L204154,u5220,m345,VICTOR,And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
179857,L204153,u5215,m345,LEONARD,"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."
179858,L204152,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side."
179859,L204151,u5215,m345,LEONARD,"Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --"
179860,L204150,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose."
179861,L204149,u5215,m345,LEONARD,"Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --"
179862,L204148,u5220,m345,VICTOR,How's the IPO?
179863,L204021,u5215,m345,LEONARD,"Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly."
179864,L204020,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Leonard, how's the feed?"
179865,L203999,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?"
179866,L203998,u5215,m345,LEONARD,Then what is it?
179867,L203997,u5220,m345,VICTOR,It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
179868,L203996,u5215,m345,LEONARD,"Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --"
179869,L203995,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Showtime.
179870,L203994,u5215,m345,LEONARD,"They're ready for you, sir."
179871,L203956,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
179872,L203955,u5215,m345,LEONARD,And if he's not...?
179873,L203954,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering."
179874,L204566,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
179875,L204565,u5216,m345,REED,But I'm not done with the machine --
179876,L204564,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me."
179877,L204563,u5216,m345,REED,What are you doing here?
179878,L204338,u5220,m345,VICTOR,I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
179879,L204337,u5216,m345,REED,"Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --"
179880,L204336,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --"
179881,L204335,u5216,m345,REED,"<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --"
179882,L204334,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
179883,L204331,u5216,m345,REED,Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
179884,L204330,u5220,m345,VICTOR,I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
179885,L204211,u5216,m345,REED,He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
179886,L204210,u5220,m345,VICTOR,<u>Ben</u> did this?
179887,L204209,u5216,m345,REED,Ben did this.
179888,L204208,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
179889,L204067,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us."
179890,L204066,u5216,m345,REED,Not until Ben is back inside!
179891,L204063,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Reed, we're running out of time."
179892,L204062,u5216,m345,REED,"Come on, Ben, come on..."
179893,L204056,u5220,m345,VICTOR,So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
179894,L204055,u5216,m345,REED,Ben's still out there --
179895,L204054,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
179896,L204053,u5216,m345,REED,"We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort."
179897,L204032,u5216,m345,REED,Sure.
179898,L204031,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second."
179899,L203953,u5216,m345,REED,Hilarious.
179900,L203952,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Funny how things turn out, isn't it?"
179901,L203946,u5220,m345,VICTOR,The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
179902,L203945,u5216,m345,REED,"You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --"
179903,L203942,u5216,m345,REED,Not at all.
179904,L203941,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"This isn't going to be a problem, is it?"
179905,L203929,u5216,m345,REED,You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
179906,L203928,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back."
179907,L204800,u5218,m345,SUE,"A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party."
179908,L204799,u5216,m345,REED,"I found a broken gasket, from space --"
179909,L204781,u5218,m345,SUE,I'm sure I can come up with something.
179910,L204780,u5216,m345,REED,"Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --"
179911,L204675,u5218,m345,SUE,You <u>need</u> a doctor.
179912,L204674,u5216,m345,REED,The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
179913,L204673,u5218,m345,SUE,"Reed, stop, you need to rest your --"
179914,L204672,u5216,m345,REED,I can...make it work.
179915,L204622,u5218,m345,SUE,That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
179916,L204621,u5216,m345,REED,Why didn't you say something?
179917,L204620,u5218,m345,SUE,"When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me."
179918,L204619,u5218,m345,SUE,"I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man."
179919,L204618,u5216,m345,REED,You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
179920,L204615,u5218,m345,SUE,I gave him twenty.
179921,L204614,u5216,m345,REED,"You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?"
179922,L204613,u5218,m345,SUE,Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
179923,L204612,u5216,m345,REED,You <u>were</u>?
179924,L204611,u5218,m345,SUE,"Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous."
179925,L204610,u5218,m345,SUE,Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
179926,L204609,u5216,m345,REED,I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
179927,L204578,u5216,m345,REED,"<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there."
179928,L204577,u5218,m345,SUE,"Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --"
179929,L204576,u5216,m345,REED,"Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --"
179930,L204575,u5218,m345,SUE,Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
179931,L204574,u5216,m345,REED,"He was going to take away all my data, equipment --"
179932,L204573,u5218,m345,SUE,Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
179933,L204492,u5216,m345,REED,"No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments."
179934,L204491,u5218,m345,SUE,Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
179935,L204426,u5216,m345,REED,"With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid..."
179936,L204425,u5218,m345,SUE,And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
179937,L204424,u5216,m345,REED,Of course.  Of course.
179938,L204423,u5218,m345,SUE,"But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?"
179939,L204422,u5216,m345,REED,"Curing countless diseases, not just ours."
179940,L204421,u5218,m345,SUE,And reverse the mutations --
179941,L204420,u5216,m345,REED,"If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --"
179942,L204419,u5216,m345,REED,"The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm."
179943,L204418,u5218,m345,SUE,What are you doing?
179944,L204389,u5218,m345,SUE,"No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does."
179945,L204388,u5216,m345,REED,There were a lot of variables to consider --
179946,L204387,u5218,m345,SUE,I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
179947,L204386,u5216,m345,REED,I think it was a little more complicated than --
179948,L204385,u5218,m345,SUE,"Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked."
179949,L204384,u5216,m345,REED,"No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo..."
179950,L204383,u5218,m345,SUE,Are you kidding?
179951,L204382,u5216,m345,REED,"I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?"
179952,L204381,u5216,m345,REED,What in the world would give me that idea?
179953,L204380,u5218,m345,SUE,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --"
179954,L204378,u5218,m345,SUE,I'm sure I can come up with something.
179955,L204377,u5216,m345,REED,Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
179956,L204376,u5218,m345,SUE,Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
179957,L204375,u5216,m345,REED,"I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --"
179958,L204374,u5218,m345,SUE,Excuse me?
179959,L204373,u5216,m345,REED,"You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --"
179960,L204369,u5218,m345,SUE,What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
179961,L204368,u5216,m345,REED,"It's not ""invisibility"" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge."
179962,L204315,u5218,m345,SUE,"If it happened to him, then it could..."
179963,L204314,u5216,m345,REED,That's what we're here to find out.
179964,L204313,u5218,m345,SUE,How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
179965,L204253,u5218,m345,SUE,What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
179966,L204252,u5216,m345,REED,Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
179967,L204250,u5216,m345,REED,We need to get past them.
179968,L204249,u5218,m345,SUE,What?
179969,L204187,u5216,m345,REED,"Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap."
179970,L204186,u5218,m345,SUE,It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
179971,L204184,u5216,m345,REED,Sue...<i>look at your hands</i>.
179972,L204183,u5218,m345,SUE,What?  What do you mean you --
179973,L204182,u5216,m345,REED,"Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>."
179974,L204177,u5218,m345,SUE,"You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics."
179975,L204176,u5216,m345,REED,For science.
179976,L204175,u5216,m345,REED,Passion.
179977,L204174,u5218,m345,SUE,Which was?
179978,L204173,u5216,m345,REED,I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
179979,L204172,u5218,m345,SUE,You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
179980,L204170,u5218,m345,SUE,You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
179981,L204169,u5216,m345,REED,That's good.  That's uh...good.
179982,L204168,u5218,m345,SUE,"Yes, thanks."
179983,L204167,u5216,m345,REED,Feeling better?
179984,L203991,u5218,m345,SUE,Great minds think alike.
179985,L203990,u5216,m345,REED,Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
179986,L203972,u5218,m345,SUE,"Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny..."
179987,L203971,u5216,m345,REED,"As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --"
179988,L203970,u5218,m345,SUE,It's been changed.
179989,L203969,u5216,m345,REED,"I, uh, think I remember the number."
179990,L203966,u5218,m345,SUE,Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
179991,L203965,u5216,m345,REED,"Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--"
179992,L203964,u5218,m345,SUE,I was talking about us.  Working together.
179993,L203963,u5216,m345,REED,"Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --"
179994,L203940,u5218,m345,SUE,Never better.
179995,L203939,u5216,m345,REED,"You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--"
179996,L204472,u5218,m345,SUE,"Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready."
179997,L204471,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Oh, I think you already have."
179998,L204470,u5218,m345,SUE,Please don't make this personal --
179999,L204469,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>."

180003,L204464,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Susan.  What are you doing?
180004,L204463,u5218,m345,SUE,"Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --"
180005,L204462,u5220,m345,VICTOR,It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
180006,L204461,u5218,m345,SUE,You said it was urgent.
180007,L204326,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care."

180014,L204206,u5220,m345,VICTOR,What's going on?
180015,L204070,u5218,m345,SUE,You can't leave them out there.
180016,L204069,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Raising the shields.
180017,L204068,u5218,m345,SUE,What are you doing?
180018,L204050,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives..."
180019,L204049,u5218,m345,SUE,"Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think..."
180020,L204048,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --"
180021,L204047,u5218,m345,SUE,"It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much."
180022,L204042,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past."
180023,L204041,u5218,m345,SUE,I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
180024,L204040,u5220,m345,VICTOR,Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
180025,L203936,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm."
180026,L203935,u5218,m345,SUE,It's just business.
180027,L204641,u5219,m345,THE THING,Skeptical...?
180028,L204640,u5220,m345,VICTOR,For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
180029,L204639,u5219,m345,THE THING,Reed's gonna fix me up --
180030,L204638,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back."
180031,L204637,u5219,m345,THE THING,If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
180032,L204636,u5220,m345,VICTOR,"I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back..."
180033,L204635,u5219,m345,THE THING,'Scuse me.
180034,L205491,u5221,m346,CARTER,"Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!"
180035,L205490,u5230,m346,REID,I'd hold that off awhile.
180036,L205489,u5221,m346,CARTER,Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
180037,L205464,u5230,m346,REID,Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.
180038,L205463,u5221,m346,CARTER,"If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own..."
180039,L205462,u5230,m346,REID,What're you getting at?
180040,L205461,u5221,m346,CARTER,That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
180041,L205460,u5230,m346,REID,What is it?
180042,L205432,u5221,m346,CARTER,"It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!"
180043,L205431,u5230,m346,REID,Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
180044,L205197,u5221,m346,CARTER,"I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess."
180045,L205196,u5230,m346,REID,I told you to cut down on the sugar.
180046,L205194,u5221,m346,CARTER,Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
180047,L205193,u5230,m346,REID,It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
180048,L205192,u5221,m346,CARTER,Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
180049,L205133,u5230,m346,REID,"They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post..."
180050,L205132,u5221,m346,CARTER,They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
180051,L205102,u5221,m346,CARTER,Message to Proteus.
180052,L205101,u5230,m346,REID,<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
180053,L205098,u5230,m346,REID,Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
180054,L205097,u5221,m346,CARTER,What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
180055,L205096,u5230,m346,REID,That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
180056,L205095,u5221,m346,CARTER,At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
180057,L205094,u5230,m346,REID,In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
180058,L205093,u5221,m346,CARTER,I know that. But what's the maximum?
180059,L205092,u5230,m346,REID,"The less time, the better."
180060,L205091,u5221,m346,CARTER,Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
180061,L205088,u5221,m346,CARTER,Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
180062,L205087,u5230,m346,REID,But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
180063,L205086,u5221,m346,CARTER,We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
180064,L205085,u5221,m346,CARTER,No...
180065,L205084,u5230,m346,REID,"But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!"
180066,L205064,u5230,m346,REID,Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
180067,L205063,u5221,m346,CARTER,That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
180068,L205062,u5230,m346,REID,They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
180069,L205013,u5221,m346,CARTER,Phase Two.
180070,L205012,u5230,m346,REID,Okay to proceed.
180071,L204949,u5230,m346,REID,Medical's ready.
180072,L204948,u5221,m346,CARTER,Where do we stand?
180073,L204931,u5221,m346,CARTER,"We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?"
180074,L204930,u5230,m346,REID,"Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --"
180075,L204908,u5230,m346,REID,Here's the overall Target Area...
180076,L204907,u5221,m346,CARTER,"Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don."
180077,L205487,u5221,m346,CARTER,Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
180078,L205486,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Yes, we'd like to get moving."
180079,L205479,u5221,m346,CARTER,He's blanked out on that one particular point.
180080,L205478,u5224,m346,GRANT,Can't remember?... What do you mean?
180081,L205477,u5221,m346,CARTER,"Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us."
180082,L204934,u5224,m346,GRANT,Where can I get a cab back to town?
180083,L204933,u5221,m346,CARTER,Yes?
180084,L204932,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Just one, General..."
180085,L204929,u5224,m346,GRANT,Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
180086,L204928,u5221,m346,CARTER,"There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack."
180087,L204900,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor."
180088,L204899,u5221,m346,CARTER,"This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon."
180089,L204889,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind."
180090,L204888,u5221,m346,CARTER,It's only for an hour --
180091,L204887,u5224,m346,GRANT,But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
180092,L204886,u5221,m346,CARTER,"Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything."
180093,L204885,u5224,m346,GRANT,Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
180094,L204884,u5221,m346,CARTER,As part of the Crew.
180095,L204883,u5224,m346,GRANT,You mean <I'm> going along?
180096,L204882,u5221,m346,CARTER,"Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --"
180097,L204881,u5224,m346,GRANT,Trip? Where to?
180098,L204880,u5221,m346,CARTER,And take a little trip with them...
180099,L204879,u5224,m346,GRANT,They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
180100,L204878,u5221,m346,CARTER,"That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him."
180101,L204877,u5224,m346,GRANT,I assume Benes knows how to control it.
180102,L204876,u5221,m346,CARTER,"They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size."
180103,L204875,u5224,m346,GRANT,If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
180104,L204874,u5221,m346,CARTER,We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
180105,L204873,u5224,m346,GRANT,"General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it."
180106,L204870,u5224,m346,GRANT,Say that again?
180107,L204869,u5221,m346,CARTER,<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
180108,L204868,u5224,m346,GRANT,I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
180109,L204867,u5221,m346,CARTER,No question of her loyalty.
180110,L204866,u5224,m346,GRANT,His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
180111,L204864,u5221,m346,CARTER,"Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike."
180112,L204863,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Right, sir."
180113,L204860,u5224,m346,GRANT,I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
180114,L204859,u5221,m346,CARTER,"We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand."
180115,L204858,u5224,m346,GRANT,"But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?"
180116,L204849,u5221,m346,CARTER,"Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out."
180117,L204848,u5224,m346,GRANT,Wish I knew why.
180118,L204843,u5224,m346,GRANT,What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
180119,L204842,u5221,m346,CARTER,"Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --"
180120,L204841,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?"
180121,L204840,u5221,m346,CARTER,Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
180122,L204839,u5221,m346,CARTER,Here's the Surgeon.
180123,L204838,u5224,m346,GRANT,I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
180124,L204836,u5224,m346,GRANT,<Me>?
180125,L204835,u5221,m346,CARTER,-- and why we need you.
180126,L204834,u5221,m346,CARTER,Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
180127,L204833,u5224,m346,GRANT,Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
180128,L204832,u5221,m346,CARTER,Brain injury.
180129,L204831,u5224,m346,GRANT,How bad off is he?
180130,L204830,u5221,m346,CARTER,The Other Side got to him.
180131,L204829,u5224,m346,GRANT,Benes... What the devil happened?
180132,L204828,u5224,m346,GRANT,"The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform..."
180133,L204827,u5221,m346,CARTER,"Hello, Grant. Good to see you again."
180134,L204862,u5221,m346,CARTER,"And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?"
180135,L204861,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
180136,L204857,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
180137,L204856,u5221,m346,CARTER,Difficult? He's impossible!
180138,L204855,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
180139,L204854,u5221,m346,CARTER,[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
180140,L204847,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant."
180141,L204846,u5221,m346,CARTER,"Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section."
180142,L204845,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Yes, Alan."
180143,L205305,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious."
180144,L205304,u5222,m346,CORA,Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
180145,L205298,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System."
180146,L205297,u5222,m346,CORA,You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
180147,L205228,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,With no laser --
180148,L205227,u5222,m346,CORA,We must!
180149,L205226,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
180150,L205219,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,We'll know -- in the next breath...
180151,L205218,u5222,m346,CORA,But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
180152,L205189,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
180153,L205188,u5222,m346,CORA,I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
180154,L205115,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
180155,L205114,u5222,m346,CORA,Listen...the Heart.
180156,L205475,u5222,m346,CORA,He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
180157,L205474,u5223,m346,DUVAL,He's making a fine recovery.
180158,L205186,u5222,m346,CORA,"I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it."
180159,L205185,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"Cora, is something wrong with the laser?"
180160,L205161,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes."
180161,L205160,u5222,m346,CORA,Air bubbles!... Doctor --
180162,L205080,u5223,m346,DUVAL,Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
180163,L205079,u5222,m346,CORA,"Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --"
180164,L205068,u5222,m346,CORA,But big enough for us...
180165,L205067,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays."
180166,L205046,u5222,m346,CORA,They're much smaller than bacteria...
180167,L205045,u5223,m346,DUVAL,Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
180168,L205003,u5223,m346,DUVAL,Thank you for volunteering.
180169,L205002,u5222,m346,CORA,I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
180170,L205001,u5223,m346,DUVAL,What is it?  Anything wrong?
180171,L205000,u5222,m346,CORA,I -- I want to say...
180172,L204999,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"Yes, Cora."
180173,L204998,u5222,m346,CORA,Doctor...
180174,L205425,u5222,m346,CORA,"Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:"
180175,L205424,u5224,m346,GRANT,We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
180176,L205356,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view."
180177,L205355,u5222,m346,CORA,What do you mean?
180178,L205354,u5224,m346,GRANT,Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
180179,L205353,u5222,m346,CORA,"Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that."
180180,L205352,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Under a cloud without cause, I take it."
180181,L205351,u5222,m346,CORA,"You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him."
180182,L205350,u5224,m346,GRANT,"As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?"
180183,L205349,u5222,m346,CORA,That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
180184,L205348,u5224,m346,GRANT,What gives you that idea?
180185,L205347,u5222,m346,CORA,Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
180186,L205346,u5224,m346,GRANT,Such as?
180187,L205345,u5222,m346,CORA,"A great deal more than that, I believe..."
180188,L205344,u5224,m346,GRANT,That's what they pay me for.
180189,L205343,u5222,m346,CORA,Thank you for saving my life.
180190,L205341,u5222,m346,CORA,I feel much better now...
180191,L205340,u5224,m346,GRANT,No need to get up --
180192,L205323,u5224,m346,GRANT,I can't till the hatch is flooded!
180193,L205322,u5222,m346,CORA,Open it! Open it before they get here!
180194,L205235,u5224,m346,GRANT,I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
180195,L205234,u5222,m346,CORA,"Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts."
180196,L205233,u5224,m346,GRANT,A surgeon might...
180197,L205232,u5222,m346,CORA,"No, it requires such absolute precision --"
180198,L205231,u5224,m346,GRANT,"If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?"
180199,L205225,u5222,m346,CORA,Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
180200,L205224,u5224,m346,GRANT,You must carry spare parts --
180201,L205207,u5222,m346,CORA,You can't --it's too dangerous --
180202,L205206,u5224,m346,GRANT,"I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it."
180203,L205200,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Not now. We need air, not greetings!"
180204,L205199,u5222,m346,CORA,Shouldn't you answer that?
180205,L205184,u5222,m346,CORA,I have no idea.
180206,L205183,u5224,m346,GRANT,Then how come it worked loose?
180207,L205182,u5222,m346,CORA,But I did. I'm positive!
180208,L205181,u5224,m346,GRANT,Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
180209,L205145,u5222,m346,CORA,Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
180210,L205144,u5224,m346,GRANT,Look at that...they're changing color...
180211,L205106,u5222,m346,CORA,And if it should take more time to get through --
180212,L205105,u5224,m346,GRANT,-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
180213,L205040,u5224,m346,GRANT,I always thought it was nothing but red.
180214,L205039,u5222,m346,CORA,I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
180215,L204994,u5222,m346,CORA,Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
180216,L204993,u5224,m346,GRANT,"A long time, with one man."
180217,L204992,u5222,m346,CORA,"I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago."
180218,L204991,u5224,m346,GRANT,I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
180219,L204990,u5222,m346,CORA,Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
180220,L204989,u5224,m346,GRANT,"That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure."
180221,L204988,u5224,m346,GRANT,Now I know...
180222,L204987,u5222,m346,CORA,That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
180223,L204984,u5222,m346,CORA,You may learn to like it.
180224,L204983,u5224,m346,GRANT,That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
180225,L204982,u5222,m346,CORA,I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
180226,L204981,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise."
180227,L204980,u5222,m346,CORA,You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
180228,L204979,u5224,m346,GRANT,"I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am."
180229,L204978,u5222,m346,CORA,We're pushing oxygen today.
180230,L204977,u5224,m346,GRANT,Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
180231,L205404,u5223,m346,DUVAL,I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
180232,L205403,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!"
180233,L205390,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it."
180234,L205389,u5223,m346,DUVAL,Removal Point? What're you talking about!
180235,L205384,u5223,m346,DUVAL,The Breath of God...
180236,L205383,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,What's that?
180237,L205382,u5223,m346,DUVAL,You left something out.
180238,L205381,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
180239,L205379,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --"
180240,L205378,u5223,m346,DUVAL,The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
180241,L205369,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise."
180242,L205368,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake."
180243,L205367,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!"
180244,L205366,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
180245,L205365,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests."
180246,L205364,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
180247,L205363,u5223,m346,DUVAL,I've done all I could with the laser.
180248,L205362,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
180249,L205361,u5223,m346,DUVAL,It's against my better Judgment...
180250,L205339,u5223,m346,DUVAL,If we can go in past the Oculomotor Nerve...
180251,L205338,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Yes...
180252,L205337,u5223,m346,DUVAL,That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
180253,L205217,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Nothing -- against all that force.
180254,L205216,u5223,m346,DUVAL,What can we do?
180255,L205153,u5223,m346,DUVAL,You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
180256,L205152,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
180257,L205108,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
180258,L205107,u5223,m346,DUVAL,We can't take a second more.
180259,L205058,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
180260,L205057,u5223,m346,DUVAL,But that isn't possible.
180261,L205049,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
180262,L205048,u5223,m346,DUVAL,I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
180263,L205047,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
180264,L205022,u5223,m346,DUVAL,It's too late now. We must go on.
180265,L205021,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
180266,L205020,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"Doctor, what's wrong?"
180267,L205456,u5224,m346,GRANT,It's too late!
180268,L205455,u5223,m346,DUVAL,What about Dr. Michaels?
180269,L205454,u5224,m346,GRANT,You said there was a quick way out!
180270,L205436,u5223,m346,DUVAL,We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
180271,L205435,u5224,m346,GRANT,The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
180272,L205420,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough..."
180273,L205419,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Doctor, we've just about had it."
180274,L205413,u5223,m346,DUVAL,If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
180275,L205412,u5224,m346,GRANT,"How does it look, Doctor?"
180276,L205376,u5224,m346,GRANT,"""Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."""
180277,L205375,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"""Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- """
180278,L205284,u5224,m346,GRANT,Then why not take it?
180279,L205283,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct."
180280,L205282,u5224,m346,GRANT,Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
180281,L205281,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"We'll never get there in time, at this rate."
180282,L205230,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"No, there's no other way."
180283,L205229,u5224,m346,GRANT,Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
180284,L205172,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Maybe we can...  Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?"
180285,L205171,u5223,m346,DUVAL,Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber -- one of the countless Alvioli of the Lung -- and we can't get enough to fill a microscopic tank.
180286,L205150,u5223,m346,DUVAL,Oxygenation...
180287,L205149,u5224,m346,GRANT,Don't tell me they're refueling...
180288,L205148,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side."
180289,L205147,u5224,m346,GRANT,Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
180290,L205139,u5223,m346,DUVAL,They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
180291,L205138,u5224,m346,GRANT,I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
180292,L205042,u5224,m346,GRANT,Quite a piece of plumbing.
180293,L205041,u5223,m346,DUVAL,Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
180294,L205038,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"Everything can be divided in half, no matter how minute."
180295,L205037,u5224,m346,GRANT,You mean Inner Space is endless?
180296,L205036,u5223,m346,DUVAL,"The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either."
180297,L205407,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
180298,L205406,u5224,m346,GRANT,I don't believe that.
180299,L205402,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
180300,L205401,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Sorry, but the situation has changed."
180301,L205400,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!"
180302,L205393,u5224,m346,GRANT,How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
180303,L205392,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader."
180304,L205391,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?"
180305,L205334,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury."
180306,L205333,u5224,m346,GRANT,Looks like quite a way to go...
180307,L205287,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading."
180308,L205286,u5224,m346,GRANT,"They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution."
180309,L205277,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System."
180310,L205276,u5224,m346,GRANT,Looks like somebody declared war.
180311,L205271,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
180312,L205270,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is."
180313,L205267,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart."
180314,L205266,u5224,m346,GRANT,I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
180315,L205265,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct."
180316,L205261,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,It's possible --
180317,L205260,u5224,m346,GRANT,Two in a row?
180318,L205259,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
180319,L205258,u5224,m346,GRANT,You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
180320,L205257,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession."
180321,L205256,u5224,m346,GRANT,That line was tampered with...
180322,L205255,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,You have no right to blame Duval --
180323,L205254,u5224,m346,GRANT,I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
180324,L205253,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Sabotage? I don't understand...
180325,L205252,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice."
180326,L205251,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
180327,L205250,u5224,m346,GRANT,Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
180328,L205249,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough."
180329,L205248,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Looks like the sea, at dawn."
180330,L205241,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Send the following message...
180331,L205240,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?"
180332,L205239,u5224,m346,GRANT,"They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel."
180333,L205238,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
180334,L205237,u5224,m346,GRANT,Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
180335,L205236,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
180336,L205212,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
180337,L205211,u5224,m346,GRANT,All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
180338,L205209,u5224,m346,GRANT,There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
180339,L205208,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --"
180340,L205204,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Well, we better get on with it."
180341,L205203,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
180342,L205176,u5224,m346,GRANT,"If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?"
180343,L205175,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"At this size, I would certainly think so."
180344,L205126,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
180345,L205125,u5224,m346,GRANT,There it is!
180346,L205117,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
180347,L205116,u5224,m346,GRANT,Sounds like heavy artillery...
180348,L205083,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Request removal, Mr. Grant."
180349,L205082,u5224,m346,GRANT,If there's any chance --
180350,L205081,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Tell them to take us out.
180351,L205078,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
180352,L205077,u5224,m346,GRANT,That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
180353,L205074,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart."
180354,L205073,u5224,m346,GRANT,"If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?"
180355,L205066,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
180356,L205065,u5224,m346,GRANT,A what?
180357,L204920,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating."
180358,L204919,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,About forty miles an hour.
180359,L204902,u5224,m346,GRANT,"How are you, Miss Peterson?"
180360,L204901,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant."
180361,L204853,u5224,m346,GRANT,Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
180362,L204852,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination."
180363,L204851,u5224,m346,GRANT,At an operation?
180364,L204850,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant."
180365,L204821,u5224,m346,GRANT,And she said it was indelible...

180367,L204819,u5224,m346,GRANT,What'd you do that for?
180368,L204818,u5224,m346,GRANT,Go ahead.
180369,L204817,u5225,m346,MAN,May I?
180370,L204816,u5225,m346,MAN,"I can't tell you that either... Excuse me, Mr. Grant, but you've got a smudge on your cheek."
180371,L204815,u5224,m346,GRANT,Where we going?
180372,L204814,u5225,m346,MAN,I can't tell you.
180373,L204813,u5224,m346,GRANT,I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
180374,L204812,u5225,m346,MAN,"Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant."
180375,L205498,u5224,m346,GRANT,Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
180376,L205497,u5228,m346,OWENS,"Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!"

180379,L205494,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?"
180380,L205452,u5224,m346,GRANT,We can get out through the Lab Section.
180381,L205451,u5228,m346,OWENS,Come on -- it's no use!
180382,L205446,u5224,m346,GRANT,Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
180383,L205445,u5228,m346,OWENS,Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
180384,L205444,u5224,m346,GRANT,What happened?
180385,L205409,u5228,m346,OWENS,Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
180386,L205408,u5224,m346,GRANT,"I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help..."
180387,L205170,u5228,m346,OWENS,"Enough to breathe, but that's all."
180388,L205169,u5224,m346,GRANT,Any reserve air?
180389,L204996,u5228,m346,OWENS,"Positions, please. And strap yourselves in."

180391,L204966,u5224,m346,GRANT,Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.

180394,L204963,u5228,m346,OWENS,"It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless."
180395,L204962,u5224,m346,GRANT,That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
180396,L204961,u5228,m346,OWENS,They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
180397,L204960,u5224,m346,GRANT,"If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?"
180398,L204959,u5228,m346,OWENS,Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
180399,L204958,u5224,m346,GRANT,Atomic fuel?
180400,L204906,u5224,m346,GRANT,That makes two of us.
180401,L204905,u5228,m346,OWENS,Sort of.
180402,L204904,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?"
180403,L205300,u5224,m346,GRANT,I could use a lawnmower...
180404,L205299,u5229,m346,OWENS' VOICE,How's it look?
180405,L205293,u5229,m346,OWENS' VOICE,What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
180406,L205292,u5224,m346,GRANT,"What's wrong, Skipper?"
180407,L205263,u5229,m346,OWENS' VOICE,Look at those Walls up ahead!
180408,L205262,u5224,m346,GRANT,Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
180409,L205174,u5224,m346,GRANT,"Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?"
180410,L205173,u5229,m346,OWENS' VOICE,"Yes, there is."
180411,L205156,u5229,m346,OWENS' VOICE,"We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there."
180412,L205155,u5224,m346,GRANT,"What is it, Skipper?"
180413,L205178,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Yes, by all means. We must try it."
180414,L205177,u5228,m346,OWENS,"It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it."
180415,L205165,u5228,m346,OWENS,Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
180416,L205164,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Was there any damage?
180417,L205163,u5228,m346,OWENS,"Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock."
180418,L205110,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart."
180419,L205109,u5228,m346,OWENS,I'll never find my way through that.
180420,L204975,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,Looks simple to operate.
180421,L204974,u5228,m346,OWENS,That's it...

180423,L204971,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?"
180424,L204925,u5226,m346,MICHAELS,"The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic."
180425,L204924,u5228,m346,OWENS,"Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --"
180426,L205417,u5227,m346,MICHAELS' VOICE,Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
180427,L205416,u5228,m346,OWENS,What do you mean?
180428,L205415,u5227,m346,MICHAELS' VOICE,There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
180429,L205143,u5227,m346,MICHAELS' VOICE,It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
180430,L205142,u5228,m346,OWENS,The Wall's transparent...
180431,L205141,u5227,m346,MICHAELS' VOICE,We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
180432,L205140,u5228,m346,OWENS,Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
180433,L205072,u5228,m346,OWENS,I'll do what I can.
180434,L205071,u5227,m346,MICHAELS' VOICE,Then don't drift down further.
180435,L205070,u5228,m346,OWENS,We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
180436,L206202,u5231,m347,ATTENDANT,"May I have your ticket, please?"
180437,L206201,u5232,m347,CARL,Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
180438,L206052,u5231,m347,ATTENDANT,"Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day."
180439,L206051,u5232,m347,CARL,I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
180440,L206050,u5231,m347,ATTENDANT,"I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars."

180443,L206047,u5232,m347,CARL,"Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here."
180444,L206046,u5231,m347,ATTENDANT,"...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?"

180458,L205761,u5232,m347,CARL,"...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd."

180491,L205675,u5232,m347,CARL,...Would it kill you to say something?
180492,L205674,u5236,m347,GRIMSRUD,No.

180516,L205993,u5232,m347,CARL,"Look. I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry. The price is now the whole amount. We want the entire eighty thousand."

180518,L205991,u5232,m347,CARL,"DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!"
180519,L205990,u5240,m347,JERRY,This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -

180527,L205982,u5232,m347,CARL,"Blood has been shed, Jerry."
180528,L205981,u5240,m347,JERRY,What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
180529,L205980,u5232,m347,CARL,"Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that."

180533,L205546,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -"
180534,L205545,u5232,m347,CARL,Personal matters.
180535,L205544,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters."
180536,L205541,u5232,m347,CARL,So why don't you just ask him for the money?
180537,L205540,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -"

180539,L205538,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -"
180540,L205537,u5232,m347,CARL,"...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -"
180541,L205536,u5240,m347,JERRY,Yah.
180542,L205535,u5232,m347,CARL,You want your own wife kidnapped?
180543,L205534,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out."
180544,L205533,u5232,m347,CARL,I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
180545,L205532,u5240,m347,JERRY,Okay.
180546,L205531,u5232,m347,CARL,"I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry."
180547,L205530,u5240,m347,JERRY,Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
180548,L205529,u5232,m347,CARL,"Yeah, you already said that."
180549,L205528,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then."
180550,L205527,u5232,m347,CARL,Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
180551,L205526,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Well, okay, it's -"
180552,L205525,u5232,m347,CARL,"Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry."
180553,L205524,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -"
180554,L205523,u5232,m347,CARL,"The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars."
180555,L205522,u5240,m347,JERRY,Huh?
180556,L205521,u5232,m347,CARL,"No, that's not it, Jerry."
180557,L205520,u5240,m347,JERRY,"...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -"
180558,L205966,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here?  You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super -"
180559,L205965,u5233,m347,CUSTOMER,"Yah, I don't need no sealant though."
180560,L205964,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -"

180564,L205611,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat."
180565,L205600,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss..."

180568,L205597,u5233,m347,CUSTOMER,"We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!"

180570,L205595,u5233,m347,CUSTOMER,"You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!"
180571,L205594,u5240,m347,JERRY,"Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -"

181178,L212265,u5258,m348,BOB,"...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls..."
181179,L212264,u5262,m348,JACK,Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
181180,L212227,u5258,m348,BOB,They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
181181,L212226,u5262,m348,JACK,"Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big."
181182,L212225,u5262,m348,JACK,Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.

181187,L212886,u5262,m348,JACK,"Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive."
181188,L212885,u5262,m348,JACK,I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
181189,L212884,u5259,m348,BOSS,Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...

181198,L212724,u5259,m348,BOSS,Is that your blood?
181199,L212610,u5262,m348,JACK,Yes.
181200,L212609,u5259,m348,BOSS,Have you finished those reports?
181201,L212608,u5262,m348,JACK,"After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  You can deal with anything."

181212,L212747,u5262,m348,JACK,Who do you think could've done this?
181213,L212746,u5260,m348,DETECTIVE STERN,"Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator."
181214,L212745,u5262,m348,JACK,This is... really a shock...
181215,L212744,u5260,m348,DETECTIVE STERN,It means it was homemade.
181216,L212743,u5262,m348,JACK,What does that mean?
181217,L212742,u5260,m348,DETECTIVE STERN,Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
181218,L212741,u5262,m348,JACK,Dynamite?
181219,L212740,u5260,m348,DETECTIVE STERN,The dynamite...

181229,L212253,u5261,m348,INTERN,"You need healthy, natural sleep. Chew valerian root and get some more exercise."

181232,L212250,u5261,m348,INTERN,You need to lighten up.
181233,L212249,u5262,m348,JACK,Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.

181239,L213505,u5262,m348,JACK,Don't ask.
181240,L213504,u5265,m348,MARLA,What happened... ?
181241,L213362,u5262,m348,JACK,"Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least."
181242,L213361,u5265,m348,MARLA,"I'm not paying this back.  I consider it ""asshole tax."""
181243,L213360,u5262,m348,JACK,"I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities..."
181244,L213359,u5265,m348,MARLA,Why are you doing this?
181245,L213358,u5262,m348,JACK,I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
181246,L213357,u5265,m348,MARLA,Tyler...
181247,L213355,u5262,m348,JACK,"Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here... here..."
181248,L213354,u5265,m348,MARLA,Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!
181249,L213353,u5262,m348,JACK,"Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else..."
181250,L213352,u5265,m348,MARLA,Let go of me!
181251,L213350,u5265,m348,MARLA,What?!  You're sorry?  I don't believe that for a minute.
181252,L213349,u5262,m348,JACK,"I'm sorry, but I..."
181253,L213348,u5265,m348,MARLA,"There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me..."
181254,L213347,u5265,m348,MARLA,"No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried..."
181255,L213346,u5262,m348,JACK,Marla...
181256,L213345,u5265,m348,MARLA,You are an insane person.
181257,L213344,u5262,m348,JACK,"You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city..."
181258,L213343,u5265,m348,MARLA,What?
181259,L213342,u5262,m348,JACK,"I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger."
181260,L213340,u5265,m348,MARLA,Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
181261,L213339,u5262,m348,JACK,"I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you..."
181262,L213338,u5265,m348,MARLA,What?
181263,L213337,u5262,m348,JACK,"I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized"
181264,L213336,u5265,m348,MARLA,Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
181265,L213335,u5262,m348,JACK,I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
181266,L213334,u5265,m348,MARLA,You got about thirty seconds.
181267,L213330,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie."
181268,L213329,u5262,m348,JACK,Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
181269,L213326,u5265,m348,MARLA,I've done you enough favors.
181270,L213325,u5262,m348,JACK,"Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor."
181271,L213324,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here."
181272,L213323,u5262,m348,JACK,"Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds."
181273,L213322,u5265,m348,MARLA,I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
181274,L213320,u5265,m348,MARLA,Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
181275,L213319,u5262,m348,JACK,Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
181276,L213318,u5265,m348,MARLA,The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
181277,L213317,u5262,m348,JACK,"I'm sorry, I..."
181278,L213316,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm."
181279,L213315,u5262,m348,JACK,Marla...
181280,L213244,u5262,m348,JACK,"Marla, no, wait..."
181281,L213243,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there..."
181282,L213242,u5262,m348,JACK,Say my name!  What's my name!?
181283,L213241,u5265,m348,MARLA,What... ?
181284,L213240,u5262,m348,JACK,Say my name.
181285,L213239,u5265,m348,MARLA,What is wrong with you?
181286,L213238,u5262,m348,JACK,What did you say... ?
181287,L213237,u5262,m348,JACK,We've just lost cabin pressure.
181288,L213236,u5265,m348,MARLA,"You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?"
181289,L213235,u5262,m348,JACK,Answer the question!
181290,L213234,u5265,m348,MARLA,Is that what you're calling it?
181291,L213233,u5262,m348,JACK,We did make love?
181292,L213232,u5265,m348,MARLA,"You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?"
181293,L213231,u5262,m348,JACK,"Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!"
181294,L213230,u5265,m348,MARLA,Is this a trick?
181295,L213229,u5262,m348,JACK,"Because the answer's ""yes"" or because the answer's ""no?"""
181296,L213228,u5265,m348,MARLA,What kind of stupid question is that?!
181297,L213227,u5262,m348,JACK,"Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?"
181298,L213226,u5265,m348,MARLA,Yeah?
181299,L213143,u5262,m348,JACK,He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
181300,L213142,u5265,m348,MARLA,What?
181301,L213141,u5262,m348,JACK,He's not here.
181302,L213140,u5265,m348,MARLA,Can I come in?
181303,L213139,u5262,m348,JACK,The Paper Street Soap Company.
181304,L213099,u5265,m348,MARLA,You're afraid to say.
181305,L213098,u5262,m348,JACK,Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
181306,L213097,u5265,m348,MARLA,Why would you get bent if I asked?
181307,L213096,u5262,m348,JACK,Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
181308,L213095,u5265,m348,MARLA,Guy or girl?
181309,L213094,u5262,m348,JACK,... A person.
181310,L213093,u5265,m348,MARLA,What is this?  Who did this?
181311,L213085,u5265,m348,MARLA,That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
181312,L213084,u5262,m348,JACK,No.
181313,L213082,u5265,m348,MARLA,Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
181314,L213081,u5262,m348,JACK,That... sawing and hammering.
181315,L213080,u5265,m348,MARLA,Hear what?
181316,L213079,u5262,m348,JACK,You hear that?
181317,L213078,u5265,m348,MARLA,What do you get out of it?
181318,L213077,u5262,m348,JACK,I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
181319,L213074,u5265,m348,MARLA,It was the smart move on her part.
181320,L213073,u5262,m348,JACK,I don't know.
181321,L213072,u5265,m348,MARLA,Do you care?
181322,L213071,u5262,m348,JACK,When?
181323,L213070,u5265,m348,MARLA,Chloe's dead.
181324,L213069,u5262,m348,JACK,Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
181325,L213068,u5265,m348,MARLA,Whatever.
181326,L213067,u5262,m348,JACK,You... don't have to... leave.
181327,L212856,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Well... thanks, anyway."
181328,L212855,u5262,m348,JACK,Uh ... nah.
181329,L212854,u5265,m348,MARLA,I could check your prostate.
181330,L212853,u5262,m348,JACK,I think everything's okay here.
181331,L212852,u5265,m348,MARLA,I wish I could return the favor.
181332,L212851,u5262,m348,JACK,No... no problem.
181333,L212850,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Well, that's a relief.  Thank you."
181334,L212849,u5262,m348,JACK,Nothing.
181335,L212848,u5265,m348,MARLA,You feel nothing?
181336,L212847,u5262,m348,JACK,"Okay.  Okay, I'm sure."
181337,L212846,u5265,m348,MARLA,Make sure.
181338,L212845,u5262,m348,JACK,No.
181339,L212844,u5265,m348,MARLA,Feel anything?
181340,L212843,u5262,m348,JACK,Here.
181341,L212842,u5265,m348,MARLA,Here.
181342,L212841,u5262,m348,JACK,There?
181343,L212840,u5265,m348,MARLA,Here.
181344,L212839,u5262,m348,JACK,Where?  Here?
181345,L212836,u5265,m348,MARLA,Good.
181346,L212835,u5262,m348,JACK,"No, thanks."
181347,L212834,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?"
181348,L212833,u5262,m348,JACK,"This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  ""Mrs. Haniver"" and... ""Mrs. Raines."" Where are they?"
181349,L212832,u5262,m348,JACK,She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral in her book.
181350,L212831,u5265,m348,MARLA,Please.
181351,L212830,u5262,m348,JACK,I don't know ...
181352,L212829,u5265,m348,MARLA,Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
181353,L212828,u5262,m348,JACK,What are you talking about?
181354,L212775,u5262,m348,JACK,Goodbye.
181355,L212774,u5265,m348,MARLA,"You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up."
181356,L212773,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Don't worry, I'm leaving."
181357,L212772,u5262,m348,JACK,It's time for you to leave.
181358,L212765,u5262,m348,JACK,It suits you.
181359,L212764,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape."
181360,L212761,u5262,m348,JACK,Worth every penny.
181361,L212760,u5265,m348,MARLA,I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
181362,L212759,u5262,m348,JACK,"Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room."
181363,L212668,u5262,m348,JACK,What the hell are you doing here?
181364,L212667,u5265,m348,MARLA,What... ?
181365,L212666,u5262,m348,JACK,What are you doing here?
181366,L212661,u5265,m348,MARLA,Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
181367,L212660,u5262,m348,JACK,So you're staying in tonight?
181368,L212659,u5262,m348,JACK,This could go on for hours.
181369,L212658,u5265,m348,MARLA,This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
181370,L212657,u5262,m348,JACK,Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
181371,L212656,u5265,m348,MARLA,Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
181372,L212655,u5262,m348,JACK,I'm just on my way out...
181373,L212654,u5265,m348,MARLA,I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
181374,L212653,u5262,m348,JACK,"Look, this is a bad time..."
181375,L212652,u5265,m348,MARLA,Like testicular cancer?
181376,L212651,u5262,m348,JACK,It's for men.
181377,L212650,u5265,m348,MARLA,Really?
181378,L212649,u5262,m348,JACK,I found a new one.
181379,L212648,u5265,m348,MARLA,You haven't been going to yours.
181380,L212647,u5262,m348,JACK,That's the idea -- we split them.
181381,L212646,u5265,m348,MARLA,The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
181382,L212645,u5262,m348,JACK,How did you find me?
181383,L212644,u5262,m348,JACK,Marla?
181384,L212643,u5265,m348,MARLA,Where have you been the last few weeks?
181385,L212371,u5265,m348,MARLA,I suppose.
181386,L212370,u5262,m348,JACK,In case we want to switch nights.
181387,L212369,u5265,m348,MARLA,Should we?
181388,L212368,u5262,m348,JACK,"Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?"
181389,L212366,u5262,m348,JACK,Let's not make a big thing out of it.
181390,L212365,u5265,m348,MARLA,Looks like this is goodbye.
181391,L212364,u5265,m348,MARLA,Deal.
181392,L212363,u5262,m348,JACK,We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
181393,L212362,u5265,m348,MARLA,"That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?"
181394,L212360,u5262,m348,JACK,The girl had done her homework.
181395,L212359,u5265,m348,MARLA,"So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer."
181396,L212355,u5262,m348,JACK,"Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three."
181397,L212354,u5265,m348,MARLA,"So far, you have four and I only have two!"
181398,L212353,u5262,m348,JACK,You can't have the whole brain!
181399,L212352,u5265,m348,MARLA,I want that.
181400,L212351,u5262,m348,JACK,Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
181401,L212350,u5265,m348,MARLA,I want brain parasites.
181402,L212349,u5262,m348,JACK,You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
181403,L212348,u5265,m348,MARLA,I'll take the parasites.
181404,L212347,u5265,m348,MARLA,I don't know -- am I?
181405,L212346,u5262,m348,JACK,You're kidding.
181406,L212345,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls."
181407,L212344,u5262,m348,JACK,I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
181408,L212343,u5265,m348,MARLA,You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
181409,L212342,u5262,m348,JACK,"We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --"
181410,L212340,u5262,m348,JACK,Please.  Can't we do something... ?
181411,L212339,u5265,m348,MARLA,Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
181412,L212338,u5262,m348,JACK,"Look, I can't cry with a faker present."
181413,L212337,u5265,m348,MARLA,Really?
181414,L212336,u5262,m348,JACK,It becomes an addiction.
181415,L212334,u5262,m348,JACK,Yeah.
181416,L212333,u5265,m348,MARLA,-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
181417,L212332,u5262,m348,JACK,"I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead..."
181418,L212329,u5262,m348,JACK,Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
181419,L212328,u5265,m348,MARLA,A year?  How'd you manage that?
181420,L212327,u5262,m348,JACK,These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
181421,L212326,u5265,m348,MARLA,"It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee."
181422,L212325,u5262,m348,JACK,Why are you doing this?
181423,L212323,u5265,m348,MARLA,Go ahead.  I'll expose you.
181424,L212322,u5262,m348,JACK,I'll expose you.
181425,L212321,u5265,m348,MARLA,"Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  ""... Mr. Taylor."""
181426,L212320,u5262,m348,JACK,Practicing what?
181427,L212319,u5265,m348,MARLA,And I saw you practicing this...
181428,L212316,u5262,m348,JACK,"Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.  But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying."
181429,L212315,u5265,m348,MARLA,What?
181430,L212314,u5262,m348,JACK,I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
181431,L212313,u5265,m348,MARLA,Sure.
181432,L212312,u5262,m348,JACK,We need to talk.
181433,L212730,u5270,m348,TYLER'S VOICE,You fucking slut!!
181434,L212729,u5262,m348,JACK,... and you come home to this.
181435,L212462,u5262,m348,JACK,Well... let me see... here's the thing...
181436,L212461,u5270,m348,TYLER'S VOICE,I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
181437,L212460,u5262,m348,JACK,I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
181438,L212459,u5270,m348,TYLER'S VOICE,"Oh, yeah."
181439,L212458,u5262,m348,JACK,"Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy."
181440,L212457,u5270,m348,TYLER'S VOICE,Who's this?
181441,L212456,u5262,m348,JACK,Tyler?
181442,L212455,u5270,m348,TYLER'S VOICE,Who's this?
181443,L212454,u5262,m348,JACK,Hello?
181444,L213225,u5262,m348,JACK,Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
181445,L213224,u5272,m348,WOUNDED BARTENDER,"You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir.  Tyler Durden."
181446,L213223,u5272,m348,WOUNDED BARTENDER,Is this part of the test?
181447,L213222,u5262,m348,JACK,Who do you think I am?
181448,L213221,u5272,m348,WOUNDED BARTENDER,"You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum."
181449,L213220,u5262,m348,JACK,What?
181450,L213219,u5272,m348,WOUNDED BARTENDER,You were in here last Thursday night.
181451,L213218,u5262,m348,JACK,Yes... it's a test.
181452,L213217,u5272,m348,WOUNDED BARTENDER,"Is this a test, sir?"
181453,L213216,u5262,m348,JACK,... You know me?
181454,L213215,u5272,m348,WOUNDED BARTENDER,How have you been?
181455,L212438,u5268,m348,SECURITY TFM,"Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh..."
181456,L212437,u5262,m348,JACK,I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
181457,L212436,u5268,m348,SECURITY TFM,"Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: ""A dildo.""  Never ""Your dildo."""
181458,L212435,u5262,m348,JACK,My suitcase was vibrating?
181459,L212434,u5268,m348,SECURITY TFM,"Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police."
181460,L212433,u5262,m348,JACK,"Excuse me?  ""Throwers?"""
181461,L212432,u5268,m348,SECURITY TFM,Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
181462,L212318,u5262,m348,JACK,"You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer."
181463,L212317,u5263,m348,LEADER,Tell the other person how you feel.
181464,L212303,u5263,m348,LEADER,"Now, find your power animal."
181465,L212302,u5262,m348,JACK,"If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't."
181466,L212294,u5263,m348,LEADER,"Okay, everyone."
181467,L212293,u5262,m348,JACK,"-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said ""parasite;"" they said ""agent.""  They always talked about getting better."
181468,L212275,u5263,m348,LEADER,"...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light."
181469,L212274,u5262,m348,JACK,"I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around."
181470,L212273,u5263,m348,LEADER,"Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra..."
181471,L213496,u5262,m348,JACK,My eyes are open.
181472,L213495,u5269,m348,TYLER,What?
181473,L213494,u5262,m348,JACK,Look at me...
181474,L213493,u5269,m348,TYLER,What?
181475,L213492,u5262,m348,JACK,Appreciate something.
181476,L213491,u5269,m348,TYLER,What?
181477,L213490,u5262,m348,JACK,Do something for me.
181478,L213488,u5262,m348,JACK,It's the only way to get rid of you...
181479,L213487,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?"
181480,L213485,u5262,m348,JACK,Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
181481,L213484,u5269,m348,TYLER,Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
181482,L213483,u5262,m348,JACK,What have you left for me?
181483,L213482,u5269,m348,TYLER,What are you doing?
181484,L213480,u5269,m348,TYLER,You will.  You know you will.
181485,L213479,u5262,m348,JACK,"I swear on my life, I won't..."
181486,L213478,u5269,m348,TYLER,"If I leave, you will be right back where I found you..."
181487,L213477,u5262,m348,JACK,"Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler."
181488,L213476,u5269,m348,TYLER,I'm doing this for us.
181489,L213475,u5262,m348,JACK,Why are you doing this?!
181490,L213474,u5269,m348,TYLER,"No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together."
181491,L213473,u5262,m348,JACK,"... no, no, no..."
181492,L213472,u5269,m348,TYLER,"From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart..."
181493,L213471,u5262,m348,JACK,"Noooo, please..."
181494,L213470,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings..."
181495,L213469,u5262,m348,JACK,"No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore."
181496,L213468,u5269,m348,TYLER,You need me.
181497,L213467,u5262,m348,JACK,Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
181498,L213466,u5269,m348,TYLER,Why what?
181499,L213465,u5262,m348,JACK,Why... why... why... ?
181500,L213463,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination."
181501,L213462,u5262,m348,JACK,How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
181502,L213460,u5269,m348,TYLER,Proceed with remote detonation.
181503,L213459,u5262,m348,JACK,NO...
181504,L213457,u5269,m348,TYLER,Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
181505,L213456,u5262,m348,JACK,Not exactly according to plan.
181506,L213455,u5269,m348,TYLER,Damn it!  God-damn it...
181507,L213454,u5262,m348,JACK,Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb.
181508,L213453,u5269,m348,TYLER,What?
181509,L213452,u5262,m348,JACK,Paraffin.
181510,L213451,u5269,m348,TYLER,What the fuck -- ?
181511,L213449,u5269,m348,TYLER,Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
181512,L213448,u5262,m348,JACK,Please...
181513,L213447,u5269,m348,TYLER,It's out of our hands.  This is it.
181514,L213446,u5262,m348,JACK,Can't you call it off... ?
181515,L213442,u5262,m348,JACK,i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
181516,L213441,u5269,m348,TYLER,"This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion."
181517,L213440,u5262,m348,JACK,I think this is about where we came in.
181518,L213439,u5269,m348,TYLER,One minute.
181519,L213433,u5262,m348,JACK,Yes.
181520,L213432,u5269,m348,TYLER,Defuse the bomb?
181521,L213431,u5262,m348,JACK,"Defuse the bomb, please."
181522,L213430,u5269,m348,TYLER,Ask me nicely.
181523,L213429,u5262,m348,JACK,Defuse the bomb.
181524,L213428,u5269,m348,TYLER,What?
181525,L213427,u5262,m348,JACK,Tyler...
181526,L213426,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here."
181527,L213425,u5262,m348,JACK,I quit.
181528,L213424,u5269,m348,TYLER,You want out?
181529,L213423,u5262,m348,JACK,Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
181530,L213422,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project ""Mayhem."""
181531,L213421,u5262,m348,JACK,"Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?"
181532,L213420,u5269,m348,TYLER,I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
181533,L213416,u5269,m348,TYLER,I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
181534,L213415,u5262,m348,JACK,Fuck you.
181535,L213414,u5269,m348,TYLER,Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
181536,L213413,u5262,m348,JACK,Yes...
181537,L213412,u5269,m348,TYLER,Green?  Did you say green?
181538,L213411,u5262,m348,JACK,I'm pulling the green wire.
181539,L213410,u5269,m348,TYLER,This is not about martyrdom.
181540,L213409,u5262,m348,JACK,"If I'm wrong, we're both dead.."
181541,L213407,u5262,m348,JACK,"If you know, I know."
181542,L213406,u5269,m348,TYLER,"I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order..."
181543,L213404,u5262,m348,JACK,You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
181544,L213403,u5269,m348,TYLER,The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
181545,L213402,u5262,m348,JACK,Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
181546,L213401,u5269,m348,TYLER,What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
181547,L213400,u5269,m348,TYLER,...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
181548,L213399,u5262,m348,JACK,Stop finishing...
181549,L213398,u5269,m348,TYLER,...to let this happen!
181550,L213397,u5262,m348,JACK,I'm not going...
181551,L213396,u5269,m348,TYLER,...stop me?
181552,L213395,u5262,m348,JACK,I'm going to...
181553,L213394,u5269,m348,TYLER,...go through with this? What are you going to do?
181554,L213393,u5262,m348,JACK,I can't let you...
181555,L213392,u5269,m348,TYLER,What a ridiculous thing to say.
181556,L213391,u5262,m348,JACK,You... you can't be serious about this.
181557,L213390,u5269,m348,TYLER,"You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be..."
181558,L213288,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Um, well... technically, no."
181559,L213287,u5262,m348,JACK,She's... you... you're fucking her.
181560,L213286,u5269,m348,TYLER,What about Marla?
181561,L213285,u5262,m348,JACK,What about Marla?
181562,L213284,u5269,m348,TYLER,Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
181563,L213283,u5262,m348,JACK,You have jobs.
181564,L213282,u5269,m348,TYLER,The house is rented in your name.
181565,L213281,u5262,m348,JACK,You took me to the house.
181566,L213280,u5269,m348,TYLER,What about them?  They're lunatics.
181567,L213279,u5262,m348,JACK,"Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?"
181568,L213278,u5269,m348,TYLER,You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
181569,L213277,u5262,m348,JACK,"No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us..."
181570,L213276,u5269,m348,TYLER,"It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but..."
181571,L213275,u5262,m348,JACK,What... what are you saying?
181572,L213274,u5269,m348,TYLER,We're going to have to do something about Marla...
181573,L213273,u5262,m348,JACK,This isn't possible...
181574,L213272,u5269,m348,TYLER,There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
181575,L213267,u5269,m348,TYLER,"But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you..."
181576,L213266,u5262,m348,JACK,"Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad..."
181577,L213264,u5269,m348,TYLER,"You can see me and hear me, but no one else can..."
181578,L213263,u5262,m348,JACK,He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
181579,L213262,u5269,m348,TYLER,"And, sometimes you control it..."
181580,L213261,u5262,m348,JACK,The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
181581,L213260,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me..."
181582,L213259,u5262,m348,JACK,What are you talking about... ?
181583,L213258,u5269,m348,TYLER,Is this really news to you?
181584,L213257,u5262,m348,JACK,What... ?
181585,L213256,u5269,m348,TYLER,"People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body."
181586,L213255,u5262,m348,JACK,I don't know!  Tell me!
181587,L213254,u5269,m348,TYLER,Why do people think anything?
181588,L213253,u5262,m348,JACK,"Answer me, Tyler."
181589,L213252,u5269,m348,TYLER,Why did you do that?
181590,L213251,u5262,m348,JACK,Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
181591,L213250,u5269,m348,TYLER,You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
181592,L213249,u5262,m348,JACK,Why do people think I'm you?
181593,L213248,u5269,m348,TYLER,"And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South."
181594,L213247,u5262,m348,JACK,"What's this all about, Tyler?"
181595,L213246,u5269,m348,TYLER,Four in Milwaukee.
181596,L213108,u5262,m348,JACK,"""Training?""  Tyler..."
181597,L213107,u5269,m348,TYLER,"If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training."
181598,L213106,u5262,m348,JACK,"""Applicant?"""
181599,L213105,u5269,m348,TYLER,"If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat."
181600,L213104,u5262,m348,JACK,"""Too young?"""
181601,L213103,u5262,m348,JACK,Wait a minute...
181602,L213102,u5269,m348,TYLER,You're too young.  Sorry.
181603,L213092,u5262,m348,JACK,... is over.
181604,L213091,u5269,m348,TYLER,... is over.
181605,L213090,u5262,m348,JACK,This conversation...
181606,L213087,u5262,m348,JACK,Nothing.
181607,L213086,u5269,m348,TYLER,What are you talking about?
181608,L213060,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me."
181609,L213059,u5262,m348,JACK,What?
181610,L213058,u5269,m348,TYLER,Why do you think I blew up your condo?
181611,L213057,u5262,m348,JACK,Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
181612,L213056,u5269,m348,TYLER,I want to hear the truth.
181613,L213055,u5262,m348,JACK,I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
181614,L213054,u5269,m348,TYLER,"If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?"
181615,L213053,u5262,m348,JACK,I don't know!  Nothing!
181616,L213047,u5262,m348,JACK,I don't think that's true.
181617,L213046,u5269,m348,TYLER,You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
181618,L213045,u5262,m348,JACK,I'm not asking you to.
181619,L213044,u5269,m348,TYLER,You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
181620,L213043,u5262,m348,JACK,What the hell ... ?!
181621,L213042,u5262,m348,JACK,Tyler...
181622,L213041,u5269,m348,TYLER,"We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap..."
181623,L213040,u5262,m348,JACK,What are you doing?!
181624,L213039,u5269,m348,TYLER,This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
181625,L213036,u5269,m348,TYLER,What do you want to know about Project Mayhem?
181626,L213035,u5262,m348,JACK,I want to know --
181627,L213034,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your ""action item list?"""
181628,L213033,u5262,m348,JACK,Look...
181629,L213032,u5269,m348,TYLER,What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
181630,L213031,u5262,m348,JACK,You know what I mean.
181631,L213030,u5269,m348,TYLER,Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
181632,L213027,u5269,m348,TYLER,Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
181633,L213026,u5262,m348,JACK,Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
181634,L213025,u5269,m348,TYLER,What should I have told you?
181635,L213024,u5262,m348,JACK,"Why wasn't I told about ""Project Mayhem?"""
181636,L213023,u5262,m348,JACK,No.
181637,L213022,u5269,m348,TYLER,Something on your mind?
181638,L213018,u5262,m348,JACK,I felt like destroying something beautiful.
181639,L213017,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?"
181640,L212998,u5269,m348,TYLER,Hey.
181641,L212997,u5262,m348,JACK,Hey.
181642,L212990,u5269,m348,TYLER,Imagine how he feels.
181643,L212989,u5262,m348,JACK,I feel sick.
181644,L212973,u5262,m348,JACK,Tell him!
181645,L212972,u5269,m348,TYLER,I asked you what you studied.
181646,L212969,u5269,m348,TYLER,"An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?"
181647,L212968,u5262,m348,JACK,Tyler...
181648,L212956,u5262,m348,JACK,What is it?
181649,L212955,u5269,m348,TYLER,Homework assignment.
181650,L212954,u5262,m348,JACK,What are we doing?
181651,L212952,u5262,m348,JACK,I thought you did.
181652,L212951,u5269,m348,TYLER,Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
181653,L212950,u5262,m348,JACK,"Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week."
181654,L212949,u5269,m348,TYLER,"I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights."
181655,L212948,u5262,m348,JACK,There's fight club in Delaware City.
181656,L212900,u5262,m348,JACK,"Okay, and... and..."
181657,L212899,u5269,m348,TYLER,Fucking sweet.
181658,L212898,u5262,m348,JACK,Six months advance pay.  Six months!
181659,L212882,u5269,m348,TYLER,Nothing.  Do what you like.
181660,L212881,u5262,m348,JACK,What... ?
181661,L212880,u5262,m348,JACK,Work.  Going to work.
181662,L212879,u5269,m348,TYLER,Yeah.  Where you headed?
181663,L212878,u5262,m348,JACK,You quit?
181664,L212877,u5269,m348,TYLER,"No thanks, I quit."
181665,L212810,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it."
181666,L212809,u5262,m348,JACK,... Marla ... ?
181667,L212807,u5262,m348,JACK,We don't... ?
181668,L212806,u5269,m348,TYLER,We don't need him...
181669,L212805,u5262,m348,JACK,It isn't... ?
181670,L212804,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen..."
181671,L212803,u5262,m348,JACK,I don't know...
181672,L212802,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?"
181673,L212801,u5262,m348,JACK,"No, I'm not..."
181674,L212800,u5269,m348,TYLER,"This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it."
181675,L212799,u5269,m348,TYLER,"No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment."
181676,L212798,u5262,m348,JACK,I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
181677,L212795,u5262,m348,JACK,I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
181678,L212794,u5269,m348,TYLER,Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
181679,L212791,u5262,m348,JACK,"Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this."
181680,L212790,u5269,m348,TYLER,Look at your hand.
181681,L212789,u5262,m348,JACK,Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
181682,L212784,u5269,m348,TYLER,This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
181683,L212783,u5262,m348,JACK,Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
181684,L212782,u5269,m348,TYLER,"As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts."
181685,L212780,u5269,m348,TYLER,A liposuction clinic.
181686,L212779,u5262,m348,JACK,What is this place?
181687,L212769,u5269,m348,TYLER,Don't mention me.
181688,L212768,u5262,m348,JACK,You get rid of her.
181689,L212752,u5262,m348,JACK,"Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't..."
181690,L212751,u5269,m348,TYLER,"""The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."""
181691,L212750,u5262,m348,JACK,Huh?
181692,L212720,u5262,m348,JACK,Uh... nah...
181693,L212719,u5269,m348,TYLER,You want to finish her off?
181694,L212713,u5269,m348,TYLER,That was three times you promised.
181695,L212712,u5262,m348,JACK,I said I promise!
181696,L212711,u5269,m348,TYLER,Promise?
181697,L212710,u5262,m348,JACK,"Yes, I promise."
181698,L212709,u5269,m348,TYLER,Promise you won't.
181699,L212708,u5262,m348,JACK,Okay.
181700,L212707,u5269,m348,TYLER,"If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me."
181701,L212706,u5269,m348,TYLER,"You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit."
181702,L212705,u5262,m348,JACK,What?
181703,L212704,u5269,m348,TYLER,Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
181704,L212703,u5262,m348,JACK,"She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home."
181705,L212702,u5269,m348,TYLER,She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
181706,L212701,u5262,m348,JACK,Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
181707,L212700,u5269,m348,TYLER,Hey... don't knock librarians.
181708,L212699,u5262,m348,JACK,"Oh, and my pace is more librarians."
181709,L212698,u5269,m348,TYLER,"She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one."
181710,L212696,u5262,m348,JACK,I'm fine.
181711,L212695,u5269,m348,TYLER,You're okay with this?
181712,L212692,u5269,m348,TYLER,Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
181713,L212691,u5262,m348,JACK,"Yeah, I'm sure."
181714,L212690,u5269,m348,TYLER,You're sure?
181715,L212688,u5262,m348,JACK,No.  Not at all.
181716,L212687,u5269,m348,TYLER,"I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?"
181717,L212686,u5262,m348,JACK,He was obviously able to handle it.
181718,L212685,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Unbelievable, huh?"
181719,L212640,u5269,m348,TYLER,Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
181720,L212639,u5262,m348,JACK,You?
181721,L212638,u5269,m348,TYLER,Good answer.
181722,L212637,u5262,m348,JACK,Okay... Ghandi.
181723,L212636,u5269,m348,TYLER,Any historical figure.
181724,L212635,u5262,m348,JACK,Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
181725,L212618,u5262,m348,JACK,Shatner.  William Shatner.
181726,L212617,u5269,m348,TYLER,Hemingway.  You?
181727,L212616,u5262,m348,JACK,Doesn't matter.
181728,L212615,u5269,m348,TYLER,Alive or dead?
181729,L212614,u5262,m348,JACK,If you could fight any celebrity?
181730,L212613,u5262,m348,JACK,"A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood."
181731,L212578,u5262,m348,JACK,Show-off.
181732,L212577,u5269,m348,TYLER,Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.

181737,L212572,u5262,m348,JACK,What?
181738,L212571,u5269,m348,TYLER,Hum.
181739,L212570,u5262,m348,JACK,The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
181740,L212562,u5262,m348,JACK,"I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year."
181741,L212561,u5269,m348,TYLER,What car?
181742,L212560,u5262,m348,JACK,Where's your car?
181743,L212558,u5269,m348,TYLER,A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
181744,L212557,u5262,m348,JACK,Same here.
181745,L212556,u5269,m348,TYLER,"After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, ""Now what?""  He said, ""Get a job.""  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, ""Now what?""  He said, ""I don't know. Get married."""
181746,L212555,u5262,m348,JACK,I know that.
181747,L212554,u5269,m348,TYLER,"He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go."
181748,L212553,u5262,m348,JACK,"Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family."
181749,L212552,u5269,m348,TYLER,My dad.  No question.
181750,L212551,u5262,m348,JACK,"My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?"
181751,L212550,u5269,m348,TYLER,Anyone.
181752,L212549,u5262,m348,JACK,Anyone?

181755,L212546,u5262,m348,JACK,What fight?
181756,L212545,u5269,m348,TYLER,The fight.
181757,L212544,u5262,m348,JACK,Call what off?
181758,L212543,u5269,m348,TYLER,We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
181759,L212542,u5262,m348,JACK,Is it?
181760,L212541,u5269,m348,TYLER,But a good strange.
181761,L212540,u5262,m348,JACK,Strange.
181762,L212539,u5269,m348,TYLER,How do you feel?
181763,L212538,u5269,m348,TYLER,Like hell.  That counted.
181764,L212537,u5262,m348,JACK,Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
181765,L212536,u5269,m348,TYLER,Surprise me.
181766,L212535,u5262,m348,JACK,Where do you want it?  In the face?
181767,L212534,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip."
181768,L212533,u5262,m348,JACK,This is crazy.
181769,L212532,u5269,m348,TYLER,Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
181770,L212531,u5262,m348,JACK,Me?
181771,L212530,u5269,m348,TYLER,I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
181772,L212529,u5262,m348,JACK,"No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?"
181773,L212528,u5269,m348,TYLER,"I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?"
181774,L212527,u5262,m348,JACK,I don't know about this.
181775,L212526,u5262,m348,JACK,You get the idea.
181776,L212525,u5269,m348,TYLER,Go ahead.  Say it.
181777,L212524,u5262,m348,JACK,"He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well..."
181778,L212523,u5269,m348,TYLER,"... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah."
181779,L212522,u5269,m348,TYLER,Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
181780,L212521,u5262,m348,JACK,He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
181781,L212519,u5262,m348,JACK,Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
181782,L212518,u5269,m348,TYLER,"A nice, big cock."
181783,L212517,u5262,m348,JACK,No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
181784,L212516,u5269,m348,TYLER,One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
181785,L212515,u5262,m348,JACK,"In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution..."
181786,L212514,u5269,m348,TYLER,-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
181787,L212513,u5262,m348,JACK,It affords him other interesting opportunities.
181788,L212512,u5269,m348,TYLER,Why would anyone want this shitty job?
181789,L212511,u5262,m348,JACK,"It's called a ""changeover.""  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea."
181790,L212510,u5269,m348,TYLER,"They're called ""cigarette burns."""
181791,L212507,u5269,m348,TYLER,I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
181792,L212506,u5262,m348,JACK,What?
181793,L212505,u5269,m348,TYLER,I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
181794,L212504,u5262,m348,JACK,What's that?
181795,L212503,u5269,m348,TYLER,"You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor."
181796,L212502,u5262,m348,JACK,Thank you.
181797,L212501,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Yes, you can."
181798,L212500,u5262,m348,JACK,Can I stay at your place?
181799,L212499,u5269,m348,TYLER,Is it a problem for you to ask?
181800,L212498,u5262,m348,JACK,Would that be a problem?
181801,L212497,u5269,m348,TYLER,Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
181802,L212496,u5262,m348,JACK,"No, I..."
181803,L212495,u5269,m348,TYLER,You called me so you could have a place to stay.
181804,L212494,u5262,m348,JACK,Huh?
181805,L212493,u5269,m348,TYLER,We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
181806,L212492,u5262,m348,JACK,I don't follow...
181807,L212491,u5269,m348,TYLER,"So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?"
181808,L212490,u5262,m348,JACK,Yeah.
181809,L212489,u5269,m348,TYLER,A hotel?
181810,L212488,u5262,m348,JACK,"God, it's late.  I should find a hotel..."
181811,L212487,u5269,m348,TYLER,Do what you like.
181812,L212486,u5262,m348,JACK,Don't I?
181813,L212485,u5269,m348,TYLER,"The things you own, they end up owning you."
181814,L212484,u5262,m348,JACK,"Well, I have to file a claim..."
181815,L212483,u5269,m348,TYLER,This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
181816,L212482,u5262,m348,JACK,I don't... think so.
181817,L212481,u5269,m348,TYLER,"The ""now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again"" list.  That list."
181818,L212480,u5262,m348,JACK,What list?
181819,L212479,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list."
181820,L212478,u5262,m348,JACK,Insurance'll cover it.
181821,L212477,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Delivered from bullshit colors like ""Cobalt,"" ""Ebony,"" and ""Fuchsia."""
181822,L212476,u5262,m348,JACK,Delivered from Martha Stewart.
181823,L212475,u5269,m348,TYLER,Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
181824,L212474,u5262,m348,JACK,Delivered from Swedish furniture.
181825,L212473,u5269,m348,TYLER,"But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered."
181826,L212472,u5269,m348,TYLER,"I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?"
181827,L212471,u5262,m348,JACK,...no ...no ...
181828,L212470,u5269,m348,TYLER,"I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy."
181829,L212469,u5262,m348,JACK,There's always that.
181830,L212468,u5269,m348,TYLER,Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
181831,L212467,u5262,m348,JACK,All gone.
181832,L212466,u5269,m348,TYLER,"And, now it's gone."
181833,L212465,u5262,m348,JACK,I guess so.
181834,L212464,u5269,m348,TYLER,This is how we fill up our lives.
181835,L212463,u5262,m348,JACK,"You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette."
181836,L212428,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up."
181837,L212427,u5262,m348,JACK,"Well, uh... great."
181838,L212426,u5269,m348,TYLER,Being clever.
181839,L212425,u5262,m348,JACK,What?
181840,L212424,u5269,m348,TYLER,How's that working out for you?
181841,L212423,u5262,m348,JACK,Thank you.
181842,L212422,u5269,m348,TYLER,The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
181843,L212421,u5262,m348,JACK,"You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--"
181844,L212414,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Why?  So you can say, ""Oh, that's what you do."" -- And be a smug little shit about it?"
181845,L212413,u5262,m348,JACK,I mean -- for a living.
181846,L212412,u5269,m348,TYLER,What do you want me to do?
181847,L212411,u5262,m348,JACK,"What do you do, Tyler?"
181848,L212408,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths..."
181849,L212407,u5262,m348,JACK,"No, supply oxygen?"
181850,L212406,u5269,m348,TYLER,You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
181851,L212405,u5269,m348,TYLER,Tyler Durden.
181852,L212404,u5262,m348,JACK,This is how I met --
181853,L212403,u5262,m348,JACK,Pardon me?
181854,L212402,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick."
181855,L212221,u5262,m348,JACK,"Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer."
181856,L212220,u5269,m348,TYLER,Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
181857,L212219,u5262,m348,JACK,"We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this."
181858,L212218,u5262,m348,JACK,"That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way."
181859,L212217,u5269,m348,TYLER,It's getting exciting now.
181860,L212213,u5262,m348,JACK,... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
181861,L212212,u5269,m348,TYLER,"One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion."
181862,L213312,u5271,m348,VOICE,"Well, sir, you said you might."
181863,L213311,u5262,m348,JACK,Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
181864,L213310,u5271,m348,VOICE,"You told me you'd say that, too."
181865,L213309,u5262,m348,JACK,Abort the plan.
181866,L213308,u5271,m348,VOICE,You told me you'd say that.
181867,L213307,u5262,m348,JACK,"Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed..."
181868,L213306,u5271,m348,VOICE,"Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid."
181869,L213305,u5262,m348,JACK,Excuse me?
181870,L213304,u5271,m348,VOICE,"Very good, Sir."
181871,L213303,u5262,m348,JACK,"Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible..."
181872,L213302,u5271,m348,VOICE,Maintenance.
181873,L213301,u5262,m348,JACK,Who is this?
181874,L213177,u5262,m348,JACK,No!
181875,L213176,u5267,m348,RICKY,His name is Robert Paulson!
181876,L213171,u5262,m348,JACK,"Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you..."
181877,L213170,u5267,m348,RICKY,Robert Paulson?
181878,L213169,u5262,m348,JACK,No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
181879,L213168,u5267,m348,RICKY,"But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names."
181880,L213167,u5262,m348,JACK,"No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name..."
181881,L213166,u5267,m348,RICKY,"But, this is Project Mayhem."
181882,L213165,u5262,m348,JACK,What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
181883,L213164,u5267,m348,RICKY,"It's what he would have wanted, sir."
181884,L212937,u5264,m348,LOU,Let go of me!!
181885,L212936,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Thank you.  Thank you, sir..."
181886,L212935,u5264,m348,LOU,"Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!"
181887,L212934,u5269,m348,TYLER,"We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs."
181888,L212933,u5264,m348,LOU,"Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!"
181889,L212932,u5269,m348,TYLER,Pleeeeeease!
181890,L212931,u5264,m348,LOU,What are you doing?!
181891,L212923,u5269,m348,TYLER,You and your friend.
181892,L212922,u5264,m348,LOU,Did you hear what I just said?!
181893,L212921,u5269,m348,TYLER,You're welcome to join our club.
181894,L212920,u5264,m348,LOU,"Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!"
181895,L212919,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Yes, it is."
181896,L212918,u5264,m348,LOU,Ain't that something?
181897,L212917,u5269,m348,TYLER,It's free to all.
181898,L212916,u5264,m348,LOU,Really?
181899,L212915,u5269,m348,TYLER,There is no money.
181900,L212914,u5264,m348,LOU,"He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?"
181901,L212913,u5264,m348,LOU,Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
181902,L212912,u5269,m348,TYLER,We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
181903,L212911,u5264,m348,LOU,Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
181904,L212986,u5266,m348,RAYMOND,"No, please, no, God, no!"
181905,L212985,u5269,m348,TYLER,Would you rather be dead?
181906,L212984,u5266,m348,RAYMOND,Too much school.
181907,L212983,u5269,m348,TYLER,Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
181908,L212982,u5266,m348,RAYMOND,Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
181909,L212981,u5269,m348,TYLER,Animals.
181910,L212977,u5269,m348,TYLER,"What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?"
181911,L212976,u5266,m348,RAYMOND,I... I don't know...
181912,L212975,u5269,m348,TYLER,Why?
181913,L212974,u5266,m348,RAYMOND,"Biology, mostly."
181914,L212971,u5269,m348,TYLER,"""Stuff.""  Were the mid-terms hard?"
181915,L212970,u5266,m348,RAYMOND,S-S-Stuff.
181916,L212967,u5266,m348,RAYMOND,"Please, God, no..."
181917,L212966,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face."
181918,L212965,u5266,m348,RAYMOND,Yesssss...
181919,L212964,u5269,m348,TYLER,Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
181920,L212963,u5269,m348,TYLER,"They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're going to die."
181921,L212962,u5266,m348,RAYMOND,How'd you know?
181922,L212961,u5269,m348,TYLER,"Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment."
181923,L215510,u5273,m349,CLEAR,I have to save Eugene!
181924,L215509,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,No!  It can't be.
181925,L215500,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
181926,L215499,u5273,m349,CLEAR,What did you see?
181927,L215464,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense."
181928,L215463,u5273,m349,CLEAR,Speed up.
181929,L215462,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,What do you want me to do?
181930,L215452,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian."
181931,L215451,u5273,m349,CLEAR,Another premonition?
181932,L215450,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake."
181933,L215449,u5273,m349,CLEAR,What did you see?  What am I looking for?
181934,L215441,u5273,m349,CLEAR,I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
181935,L215440,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
181936,L215431,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?"
181937,L215430,u5273,m349,CLEAR,Six duds in a row.
181938,L215429,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
181939,L215428,u5273,m349,CLEAR,Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
181940,L215427,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list."
181941,L215426,u5273,m349,CLEAR,What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
181942,L215416,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"How you doing in there, hero?"
181943,L215415,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,What about that?
181944,L215205,u5273,m349,CLEAR,So let's do it.
181945,L215204,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby."
181946,L215203,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"Please, what else could it mean?"
181947,L215198,u5273,m349,CLEAR,Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
181948,L215197,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
181949,L215196,u5273,m349,CLEAR,You were there?
181950,L215195,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
181951,L215193,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I...I...
181952,L215192,u5273,m349,CLEAR,You have to tell us now.
181953,L215159,u5273,m349,CLEAR,I hope you're ready for this.
181954,L215158,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
181955,L215118,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
181956,L215117,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all."
181957,L215115,u5273,m349,CLEAR,That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
181958,L215114,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
181959,L215113,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death."
181960,L215112,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Signs?
181961,L215111,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs."
181962,L215107,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first."
181963,L215106,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does."
181964,L215105,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
181965,L215103,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!"
181966,L215102,u5273,m349,CLEAR,The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
181967,L215101,u5273,m349,CLEAR,Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
181968,L215100,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,What list?
181969,L215099,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up."
181970,L215098,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?"
181971,L215097,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long."
181972,L215096,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
181973,L215095,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"Yeah, how?"
181974,L215094,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
181975,L215093,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?"
181976,L215494,u5273,m349,CLEAR,She had the baby?
181977,L215493,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Don't sweat it.  It's over.
181978,L215492,u5273,m349,CLEAR,A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
181979,L215443,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be..."
181980,L215442,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
181981,L215221,u5273,m349,CLEAR,We need to hurry.
181982,L215220,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two."
181983,L215215,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Taken care of.
181984,L215214,u5273,m349,CLEAR,Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
181985,L215200,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"Holy shit.  He said ""only new life can defeat death.""  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design..."
181986,L215199,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
181987,L215164,u5273,m349,CLEAR,He probably already knows we're coming.
181988,L215163,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Should we knock?
181989,L215162,u5273,m349,CLEAR,A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
181990,L215376,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited."
181991,L215375,u5276,m349,EUGENE,"So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place."
181992,L215374,u5273,m349,CLEAR,Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
181993,L215373,u5276,m349,EUGENE,I'm not sure I understand.
181994,L215326,u5273,m349,CLEAR,Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
181995,L215325,u5276,m349,EUGENE,"Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I..."
181996,L215272,u5276,m349,EUGENE,"What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts."
181997,L215271,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"Random, sure."
181998,L215270,u5276,m349,EUGENE,Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
181999,L215367,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?"
182000,L215366,u5284,m349,RORY,"Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show..."
182001,L215365,u5273,m349,CLEAR,Carter.
182002,L215364,u5284,m349,RORY,"I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign."
182003,L215266,u5273,m349,CLEAR,"What about the rest of you?  Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?"
182004,L215265,u5284,m349,RORY,That lucky bastard.
182005,L215264,u5273,m349,CLEAR,The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
182006,L214971,u5274,m349,DANO,"Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy."
182007,L214970,u5277,m349,FRANKIE,"Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?"
182008,L214964,u5274,m349,DANO,"Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly."
182009,L214963,u5277,m349,FRANKIE,"Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?"
182010,L214957,u5277,m349,FRANKIE,Who?
182011,L214956,u5274,m349,DANO,Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
182012,L214955,u5277,m349,FRANKIE,A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
182013,L214923,u5277,m349,FRANKIE,"Yeah, you should have specified."
182014,L214922,u5274,m349,DANO,"Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed."
182015,L214917,u5274,m349,DANO,Blow me.
182016,L214916,u5277,m349,FRANKIE,"Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?"
182017,L215061,u5275,m349,DETECTIVE SUBY,Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
182018,L215060,u5287,m349,THOMAS,What?
182019,L215059,u5275,m349,DETECTIVE SUBY,Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
182020,L215058,u5287,m349,THOMAS,You've made your point.
182021,L215031,u5275,m349,DETECTIVE SUBY,"I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line."
182022,L215030,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind."
182023,L215029,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
182024,L215028,u5275,m349,DETECTIVE SUBY,Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
182025,L215381,u5278,m349,ISABELLA,Do you want to deliver this baby?
182026,L215380,u5286,m349,STEVE,I've got to stop and help those people.
182027,L215379,u5278,m349,ISABELLA,Please.  It's not going to wait.
182028,L215346,u5278,m349,ISABELLA,Take my van!
182029,L215345,u5286,m349,STEVE,"Damn, they always stick me with the clunker."
182030,L215341,u5278,m349,ISABELLA,Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
182031,L215340,u5286,m349,STEVE,Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
182032,L215339,u5278,m349,ISABELLA,"What do you mean ""grand theft auto?"" This is insane."
182033,L215245,u5279,m349,JORGE,She did.
182034,L215244,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
182035,L215243,u5279,m349,JORGE,Take a guess.
182036,L215242,u5287,m349,THOMAS,What was the fight about?
182037,L215241,u5279,m349,JORGE,"We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going."
182038,L215230,u5279,m349,JORGE,No.  What's this about?
182039,L215229,u5287,m349,THOMAS,May we come in?
182040,L215228,u5279,m349,JORGE,Maybe.  What's this about?
182041,L215227,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Are you Jorge Cruz?
182042,L215225,u5287,m349,THOMAS,I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
182043,L215224,u5279,m349,JORGE,What?
182044,L215353,u5280,m349,KAT,I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
182045,L215352,u5284,m349,RORY,"Yeah, so what happened?"
182046,L215351,u5280,m349,KAT,"I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night."
182047,L215349,u5284,m349,RORY,"But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man."
182048,L215348,u5280,m349,KAT,Yeah?
182049,L215347,u5284,m349,RORY,"Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up..."
182050,L215275,u5284,m349,RORY,"Anyway, I guessed it right and won these."
182051,L215274,u5280,m349,KAT,"Eighteen.  And it's ""Hebrew""."
182052,L215273,u5284,m349,RORY,"Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means ""good luck"" in Jewish."
182053,L215258,u5284,m349,RORY,Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
182054,L215257,u5280,m349,KAT,"This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house..."
182055,L215046,u5284,m349,RORY,"Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season."
182056,L215045,u5280,m349,KAT,"First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense."
182057,L215536,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment."
182058,L215535,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad."
182059,L215530,u5287,m349,THOMAS,I know.  I can feel it too.
182060,L215529,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
182061,L215522,u5287,m349,THOMAS,That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
182062,L215521,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
182063,L215505,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
182064,L215504,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
182065,L215503,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
182066,L215502,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I don't...what if I made a mistake?
182067,L215501,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?"
182068,L215498,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I know how it feels to be dead.
182069,L215497,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Are you okay?  You just face planted!
182070,L215460,u5287,m349,THOMAS,No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
182071,L215459,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Shouldn't we pull over?
182072,L215454,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
182073,L215453,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Kalarjian?
182074,L215446,u5287,m349,THOMAS,I wasn't worried about us.
182075,L215445,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
182076,L215444,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down."
182077,L215388,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
182078,L215387,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Stop it, don't move him!"
182079,L215338,u5287,m349,THOMAS,You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
182080,L215337,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,How do you know?
182081,L215336,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe."
182082,L215279,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
182083,L215278,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Whoa, nine months?"
182084,L215208,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?"
182085,L215207,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
182086,L215206,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident."
182087,L215202,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?"
182088,L215201,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
182089,L215187,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful."
182090,L215186,u5287,m349,THOMAS,New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
182091,L215161,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Who is this guy, anyway?"
182092,L215160,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,This is cheery.
182093,L215152,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares."
182094,L215151,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,We have to tell her she's in danger!
182095,L215150,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
182096,L215139,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Hold on.
182097,L215138,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
182098,L215131,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
182099,L215130,u5287,m349,THOMAS,I'm not following you --
182100,L215129,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!"
182101,L215127,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Clean up?  I don't...
182102,L215126,u5287,m349,THOMAS,I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
182103,L215125,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
182104,L215124,u5287,m349,THOMAS,I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
182105,L215123,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Evan Shaeffer's dead.
182106,L215122,u5287,m349,THOMAS,I tried calling last night but your father --
182107,L215020,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,...My Premonition was just like his.
182108,L215019,u5287,m349,THOMAS,You mean Alex Browning.
182109,L215017,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Like what?
182110,L215016,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling ""pile up"" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like..."
182111,L215012,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did."
182112,L215011,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Do you remember what triggered it all?
182113,L215010,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face..."
182114,L215009,u5287,m349,THOMAS,Tell me again how it started.
182115,L214997,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
182116,L214996,u5287,m349,THOMAS,"Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!"
182117,L214995,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
182118,L214987,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
182119,L214986,u5287,m349,THOMAS,What's going on here?
182120,L214978,u5285,m349,SHAINA,"For Christ sakes girl, take a breath."
182121,L214977,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell."
182122,L214976,u5285,m349,SHAINA,"Relax, you need to chill the fuck out."
182123,L214974,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!"
182124,L214973,u5285,m349,SHAINA,What is it?  What are you?
182125,L214967,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
182126,L214966,u5285,m349,SHAINA,What is it?  What are you?
182127,L214960,u5285,m349,SHAINA,How does a nice mature fuck sound?
182128,L214959,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
182129,L214945,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I can live with thaaaa --
182130,L214944,u5285,m349,SHAINA,"Get ready to smile, five guys per girl."
182131,L214943,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
182132,L214915,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"No, I'm good."
182133,L214914,u5285,m349,SHAINA,Want me to drive?
182134,L215333,u5284,m349,RORY,"Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart."
182135,L215332,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I guess so.
182136,L215331,u5284,m349,RORY,"And you're gonna die after me, right?"
182137,L215330,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I...I don't know.
182138,L215329,u5284,m349,RORY,When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
182139,L215328,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,Sure.
182140,L215327,u5284,m349,RORY,Can I ask you a question?
182141,L215277,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance."
182142,L215276,u5284,m349,RORY,The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
182143,L215015,u5284,m349,RORY,"Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette."
182144,L215014,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
182145,L215084,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
182146,L215083,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away."
182147,L215082,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
182148,L215080,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight."
182149,L215079,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
182150,L215049,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,That it's not over yet.
182151,L215048,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,What feeling?
182152,L215047,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling."
182153,L214929,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you."
182154,L214928,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,I mean it.  Take care of it.
182155,L214927,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem."
182156,L214926,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
182157,L214925,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Hey, Dad.  What's up?"
182158,L214924,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,Kimberly?  It's Dad.
182159,L214909,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"I know, Dad."
182160,L214908,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
182161,L214907,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,"I know, honey.  I just --"
182162,L214906,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
182163,L214902,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
182164,L214901,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia."
182165,L214900,u5282,m349,MR. BURROUGHS,"You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?"
182166,L214899,u5281,m349,KIMBERLY,"Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you."
182167,L215133,u5283,m349,NORA,"Nice try, kiddo."
182168,L215132,u5288,m349,TIM,You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
182169,L215074,u5288,m349,TIM,You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
182170,L215073,u5283,m349,NORA,Yeah?
182171,L215072,u5288,m349,TIM,Mom?
182172,L215038,u5288,m349,TIM,"Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'."
182173,L215037,u5283,m349,NORA,"You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside."
182174,L214992,u5288,m349,TIM,"Who am I, David Blane?"
182175,L214991,u5283,m349,NORA,What on Earth are they doing?
182176,L214952,u5283,m349,NORA,"I know, we'll be there soon."
182177,L214951,u5288,m349,TIM,"Damn, it really hurts, Mom."
182178,L214883,u5289,m350,ALEX,When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
182179,L214882,u5292,m350,CLEAR,No! No! Don't!
182180,L214881,u5289,m350,ALEX,You know what to do.
182181,L214852,u5289,m350,ALEX,That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
182182,L214851,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Police are coming.
182183,L214833,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Get out! Get out of the car!
182184,L214832,u5289,m350,ALEX,Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
182185,L214829,u5289,m350,ALEX,Don't do it! Don't do it!
182186,L214828,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"Carter, get out!"
182187,L214827,u5289,m350,ALEX,"Easy, Billy, just open it."
182188,L214826,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Can't you open the door?!
182189,L214820,u5289,m350,ALEX,Let us out!
182190,L214819,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Stop the car!
182191,L214787,u5289,m350,ALEX,"They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash..."
182192,L214786,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
182193,L214783,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us."
182194,L214782,u5289,m350,ALEX,"I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me."
182195,L214781,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Nothing is... anymore.
182196,L214780,u5289,m350,ALEX,"No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe."
182197,L214779,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
182198,L214771,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Most kids never have it happen.
182199,L214770,u5289,m350,ALEX,"Most kids do, I guess."
182200,L214679,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence."
182201,L214678,u5289,m350,ALEX,"No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design."
182202,L214677,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?"
182203,L214672,u5292,m350,CLEAR,That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
182204,L214671,u5289,m350,ALEX,"I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane."
182205,L214668,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach."
182206,L214667,u5289,m350,ALEX,Right. April 25th.
182207,L214666,u5292,m350,CLEAR,4:25.
182208,L214664,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Like... 4:25.
182209,L214663,u5289,m350,ALEX,Remember the departure time?
182210,L214662,u5289,m350,ALEX,Thirty-nine.
182211,L214661,u5292,m350,CLEAR,No.
182212,L214660,u5289,m350,ALEX,Remember the gate number?
182213,L214659,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Thirty-nine.
182214,L214658,u5289,m350,ALEX,How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
182215,L214657,u5292,m350,CLEAR,As in flannels and plaids?
182216,L214656,u5289,m350,ALEX,He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
182217,L214626,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
182218,L214625,u5289,m350,ALEX,"Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!"
182219,L214624,u5289,m350,ALEX,"That's him, but... he's not here."
182220,L214623,u5292,m350,CLEAR,I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
182221,L214622,u5289,m350,ALEX,That... him?
182222,L214620,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
182223,L214619,u5289,m350,ALEX,This place?!
182224,L214616,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"Then, let's go see him!"
182225,L214615,u5289,m350,ALEX,"I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know."
182226,L214614,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"Is that something you're ""feeling?"""
182227,L214613,u5289,m350,ALEX,What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
182228,L214612,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"""It?"""
182229,L214611,u5289,m350,ALEX,"I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere."
182230,L214610,u5292,m350,CLEAR,That's why I was there last night.
182231,L214606,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction."
182232,L214605,u5289,m350,ALEX,I'm... really sorry.
182233,L214604,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex."
182234,L214598,u5292,m350,CLEAR,It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
182235,L214597,u5289,m350,ALEX,"You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits."
182236,L214593,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future."
182237,L214592,u5289,m350,ALEX,It's only the end of June.
182238,L214521,u5292,m350,CLEAR,He's not a witch.
182239,L214520,u5289,m350,ALEX,How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
182240,L214855,u5289,m350,ALEX,Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
182241,L214854,u5291,m350,CARTER,"""Intervention?"" What are you, God now?!"
182242,L214853,u5289,m350,ALEX,My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
182243,L214850,u5289,m350,ALEX,But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
182244,L214849,u5291,m350,CARTER,You're the fuckin' devil.
182245,L214848,u5289,m350,ALEX,"You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead."
182246,L214810,u5289,m350,ALEX,No!
182247,L214809,u5291,m350,CARTER,"What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?"
182248,L214801,u5289,m350,ALEX,It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
182249,L214800,u5291,m350,CARTER,You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
182250,L214799,u5289,m350,ALEX,Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
182251,L214785,u5289,m350,ALEX,Why do you think I was hiding?
182252,L214784,u5291,m350,CARTER,"Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?"
182253,L214692,u5289,m350,ALEX,"Look, there's something you should all know."
182254,L214691,u5291,m350,CARTER,We're losing our favorite teacher.
182255,L214557,u5291,m350,CARTER,All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
182256,L214556,u5289,m350,ALEX,I don't.
182257,L214555,u5291,m350,CARTER,"Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything."
182258,L214517,u5289,m350,ALEX,I wish you were on the plane!
182259,L214516,u5291,m350,CARTER,"You're payin' for my trip, Browning!"
182260,L214490,u5289,m350,ALEX,Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
182261,L214489,u5291,m350,CARTER,I'll remove him.
182262,L214570,u5289,m350,ALEX,That's a plan.
182263,L214569,u5294,m350,TOD,"Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks."
182264,L214509,u5294,m350,TOD,"Been on many planes that blew up, have you?"
182265,L214508,u5289,m350,ALEX,And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
182266,L214465,u5294,m350,TOD,"Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' ""Stepmom."""
182267,L214464,u5289,m350,ALEX,"C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?"
182268,L214463,u5294,m350,TOD,Fag.
182269,L214448,u5294,m350,TOD,"Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?"
182270,L214447,u5289,m350,ALEX,"Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay."
182271,L214731,u5289,m350,ALEX,"No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control."
182272,L214730,u5295,m350,WEINE,Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
182273,L214719,u5295,m350,WEINE,"Oh, you've noticed it, too?"
182274,L214718,u5289,m350,ALEX,"Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring."
182275,L214717,u5295,m350,WEINE,"""Next?"""
182276,L214716,u5289,m350,ALEX,I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
182277,L214531,u5289,m350,ALEX,No. I saw it. I saw it!
182278,L214530,u5295,m350,WEINE,"Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?"
182279,L214529,u5289,m350,ALEX,I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
182280,L214650,u5293,m350,MR. BLUDWORTH,No harm. No foul.
182281,L214649,u5289,m350,ALEX,I'm sorry we broke in.
182282,L214645,u5289,m350,ALEX,Design?
182283,L214644,u5293,m350,MR. BLUDWORTH,"You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave."
182284,L214642,u5289,m350,ALEX,You saying Tod did kill himself?
182285,L214641,u5293,m350,MR. BLUDWORTH,... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
182286,L214640,u5293,m350,MR. BLUDWORTH,In Death...
182287,L214639,u5289,m350,ALEX,His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
182288,L214637,u5289,m350,ALEX,Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
182289,L214636,u5293,m350,MR. BLUDWORTH,Cuticle lacerations.
182290,L214632,u5293,m350,MR. BLUDWORTH,I know who you are.
182291,L214631,u5289,m350,ALEX,"I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father..."
182292,L214838,u5290,m350,BILLY,No one's that strong.
182293,L214837,u5291,m350,CARTER,It broke!
182294,L214796,u5291,m350,CARTER,Whatta' you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
182295,L214795,u5290,m350,BILLY,"Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time..."
182296,L214794,u5291,m350,CARTER,"Me, right? That's why you're not saying."
182297,L214793,u5290,m350,BILLY,Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
182298,L214763,u5291,m350,CARTER,"'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!"
182299,L214762,u5290,m350,BILLY,"Hey, man, why'd you say that?!"
182300,L214761,u5291,m350,CARTER,Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
182301,L214760,u5290,m350,BILLY,And don't pass on the right.
182302,L214842,u5292,m350,CLEAR,WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
182303,L214841,u5291,m350,CARTER,"SHUT UP, BILLY!"
182304,L214817,u5291,m350,CARTER,I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
182305,L214816,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now."
182306,L214815,u5291,m350,CARTER,That's what I'm doin'!
182307,L214814,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Get control of yourself!
182308,L214806,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Not with us in the fuckin' car!
182309,L214805,u5291,m350,CARTER,"May as well go out under my own free will, right?"
182310,L214804,u5292,m350,CLEAR,Knock it off!
182311,L214798,u5291,m350,CARTER,You have a responsibility to tell me.
182312,L214797,u5292,m350,CLEAR,He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
182313,L214754,u5292,m350,CLEAR,"They're watching me, see if I go to Alex."
182314,L214753,u5291,m350,CARTER,"So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?"
182315,L214752,u5291,m350,CARTER,Terry's name should be on this wall.
182316,L214751,u5292,m350,CLEAR,What are you doing?
182317,L216609,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,There's the Mekong.
182318,L216608,u5296,m351,BREWER,"... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light..."
182319,L216597,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,Star Wars?
182320,L216596,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!"
182321,L216509,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?"
182322,L216508,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
182323,L216507,u5296,m351,BREWER,Really?  How come he didn't take me?
182324,L216506,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
182325,L216388,u5296,m351,BREWER,What just happened?
182326,L216387,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,Wow!
182327,L216378,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,"Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around."
182328,L216377,u5296,m351,BREWER,What's that?
182329,L216376,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,"Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one..."
182330,L216375,u5296,m351,BREWER,You mean the snake?
182331,L216372,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
182332,L216371,u5296,m351,BREWER,No.
182333,L216370,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,"I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?"
182334,L216364,u5296,m351,BREWER,"That's right, buddy."
182335,L216363,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,"Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?"
182336,L216362,u5296,m351,BREWER,Huh?
182337,L216361,u5298,m351,DE FRAVIO,You guys are real... aren't you?
182338,L216599,u5302,m351,RAMBO,How much we got left in that minigun?
182339,L216598,u5296,m351,BREWER,You're gonna love it.
182340,L216592,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Forget it.
182341,L216591,u5296,m351,BREWER,"It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus..."
182342,L216590,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
182343,L216586,u5296,m351,BREWER,Duck soup.
182344,L216585,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Can you handle the door gun?
182345,L216584,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand."
182346,L216583,u5302,m351,RAMBO,You comin'?
182347,L216582,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Gawd, you look awful."
182348,L216468,u5296,m351,BREWER,What... whattaya do?
182349,L216467,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Yes.
182350,L216466,u5296,m351,BREWER,Are they going to torture us?
182351,L216402,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?"
182352,L216401,u5302,m351,RAMBO,You better take off.
182353,L216347,u5302,m351,RAMBO,You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
182354,L216346,u5296,m351,BREWER,"It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man."
182355,L216345,u5296,m351,BREWER,I suppose you have...
182356,L216344,u5302,m351,RAMBO,You never been in one of those things.
182357,L216343,u5296,m351,BREWER,What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
182358,L216342,u5302,m351,RAMBO,I'm getting him out.
182359,L216341,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Nothing we can do, man."
182360,L216340,u5302,m351,RAMBO,That guy's not going to make it.
182361,L216339,u5296,m351,BREWER,Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
182362,L216338,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
182363,L216337,u5296,m351,BREWER,Alright.  Home run.
182364,L216336,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Roundeye.
182365,L216335,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Let me see.
182366,L216334,u5296,m351,BREWER,Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
182367,L216333,u5302,m351,RAMBO,American?
182368,L216332,u5296,m351,BREWER,It's a guy in a cage.
182369,L216326,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
182370,L216325,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing."
182371,L216321,u5296,m351,BREWER,I need a vacation.
182372,L216320,u5302,m351,RAMBO,"How you doing, Brewer?"
182373,L216287,u5296,m351,BREWER,Pirates?  No kidding?
182374,L216286,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Sometimes they do.  They're river pirates.  Opium runners.
182375,L216285,u5296,m351,BREWER,These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
182376,L216284,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Yeah.  Dinky-dau, that's me.  Hey, Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?"
182377,L216283,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Powerful warrior.
182378,L216282,u5296,m351,BREWER,What's that?
182379,L216281,u5302,m351,RAMBO,She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
182380,L216280,u5296,m351,BREWER,What's she saying?
182381,L216276,u5296,m351,BREWER,Yeah...
182382,L216275,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
182383,L216274,u5296,m351,BREWER,How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
182384,L216273,u5302,m351,RAMBO,We'll check it out.
182385,L216272,u5296,m351,BREWER,Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
182386,L216271,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
182387,L216266,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Fermented fish sauce.
182388,L216265,u5296,m351,BREWER,What's this stuff on the rice?
182389,L216243,u5296,m351,BREWER,I had it cupped.
182390,L216242,u5302,m351,RAMBO,No cigarettes.
182391,L216241,u5296,m351,BREWER,You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
182392,L216239,u5296,m351,BREWER,Damn!  Leeches.
182393,L216238,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
182394,L216237,u5296,m351,BREWER,This place is a trip.
182395,L216236,u5302,m351,RAMBO,There are no worse places.
182396,L216235,u5296,m351,BREWER,I've seen worse places.
182397,L216234,u5302,m351,RAMBO,That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
182398,L216233,u5296,m351,BREWER,I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
182399,L216232,u5302,m351,RAMBO,No.
182400,L216231,u5296,m351,BREWER,You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
182401,L216228,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Exactly.
182402,L216227,u5296,m351,BREWER,And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
182403,L216226,u5302,m351,RAMBO,There's a compass in the handle.
182404,L216225,u5296,m351,BREWER,"That's it?  Some C-4, a map and a knife?"
182405,L216224,u5296,m351,BREWER,Where's your stuff?
182406,L216223,u5302,m351,RAMBO,"Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up."
182407,L216222,u5296,m351,BREWER,AC-System 'Big-Ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. Can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
182408,L216221,u5302,m351,RAMBO,What's this?
182409,L216220,u5296,m351,BREWER,This is state-of-the-art firepower.
182410,L216219,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Batteries not included.
182411,L216218,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system."
182412,L216217,u5302,m351,RAMBO,What do you call that?
182413,L216212,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Keep it down, man.  I got problems."
182414,L216211,u5302,m351,RAMBO,You okay?
182415,L216209,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Home on my strobe.
182416,L216208,u5296,m351,BREWER,Read you.
182417,L216207,u5302,m351,RAMBO,"You read me, Brewer?"
182418,L216183,u5302,m351,RAMBO,"You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you."
182419,L216182,u5296,m351,BREWER,Yeah.  Why not?
182420,L216179,u5296,m351,BREWER,"We're leaving tonight, not in a week."
182421,L216178,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
182422,L216177,u5296,m351,BREWER,That's what I'm here for.
182423,L216176,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Show me how it operates.
182424,L216175,u5296,m351,BREWER,No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
182425,L216172,u5302,m351,RAMBO,Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
182426,L216171,u5296,m351,BREWER,"Gettin' old, huh?"
182427,L216170,u5302,m351,RAMBO,One hundred.
182428,L216169,u5296,m351,BREWER,"... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ."
