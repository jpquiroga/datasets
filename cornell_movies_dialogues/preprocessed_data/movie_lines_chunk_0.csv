0,L1045,u0,m0,BIANCA,They do not!
1,L1044,u2,m0,CAMERON,They do to!
2,L985,u0,m0,BIANCA,I hope so.
3,L984,u2,m0,CAMERON,She okay?
4,L925,u0,m0,BIANCA,Let's go.
5,L924,u2,m0,CAMERON,Wow
6,L872,u0,m0,BIANCA,Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
7,L871,u2,m0,CAMERON,No
8,L870,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this ""persona""?  And you don't know how to quit?"
9,L869,u0,m0,BIANCA,Like my fear of wearing pastels?
10,L868,u2,m0,CAMERON,"The ""real you""."
11,L867,u0,m0,BIANCA,What good stuff?
12,L866,u2,m0,CAMERON,I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
13,L865,u2,m0,CAMERON,Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
14,L864,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself."
15,L863,u2,m0,CAMERON,What crap?
16,L862,u0,m0,BIANCA,do you listen to this crap?
17,L861,u2,m0,CAMERON,No...
18,L860,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Then Guillermo says, ""If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."""
19,L699,u2,m0,CAMERON,You always been this selfish?
20,L698,u0,m0,BIANCA,But
21,L697,u2,m0,CAMERON,Then that's all you had to say.
22,L696,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Well, no..."
23,L695,u2,m0,CAMERON,"You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?"
24,L694,u0,m0,BIANCA,I was?
25,L693,u2,m0,CAMERON,"I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be ""occupied""."
26,L663,u0,m0,BIANCA,Tons
27,L662,u2,m0,CAMERON,Have fun tonight?
28,L578,u2,m0,CAMERON,I believe we share an art instructor
29,L577,u0,m0,BIANCA,You know Chastity?
30,L576,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?"
31,L575,u0,m0,BIANCA,Hi.
32,L407,u0,m0,BIANCA,Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
33,L406,u2,m0,CAMERON,So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
34,L405,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies."
35,L404,u2,m0,CAMERON,She's not a...
36,L403,u2,m0,CAMERON,I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
37,L402,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes."
38,L401,u2,m0,CAMERON,Sure have.
39,L368,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment."
40,L367,u2,m0,CAMERON,How do you get your hair to look like that?
41,L366,u0,m0,BIANCA,You're sweet.
42,L365,u2,m0,CAMERON,You have my word.  As a gentleman
43,L364,u0,m0,BIANCA,I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
44,L363,u2,m0,CAMERON,You got something on your mind?
45,L281,u0,m0,BIANCA,Where?
46,L280,u2,m0,CAMERON,There.
47,L277,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Well, there's someone I think might be --"
48,L276,u0,m0,BIANCA,How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
49,L275,u0,m0,BIANCA,Forget French.
50,L274,u2,m0,CAMERON,That's because it's such a nice one.
51,L273,u0,m0,BIANCA,I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
52,L272,u2,m0,CAMERON,Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
53,L271,u0,m0,BIANCA,C'esc ma tete. This is my head
54,L208,u2,m0,CAMERON,Let me see what I can do.
55,L207,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend..."
56,L206,u2,m0,CAMERON,That's a shame.
57,L205,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something."
58,L204,u2,m0,CAMERON,Why?
59,L203,u2,m0,CAMERON,Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
60,L202,u0,m0,BIANCA,"The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does."
61,L201,u2,m0,CAMERON,Cameron.
62,L200,u0,m0,BIANCA,"No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---"
63,L199,u2,m0,CAMERON,Forget it.
64,L198,u0,m0,BIANCA,You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
65,L197,u2,m0,CAMERON,Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
66,L196,u0,m0,BIANCA,Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
67,L195,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you."
68,L194,u0,m0,BIANCA,Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
69,L953,u0,m0,BIANCA,I did.
70,L952,u3,m0,CHASTITY,You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
71,L660,u3,m0,CHASTITY,I don't have to be home 'til two.
72,L659,u0,m0,BIANCA,I have to be home in twenty minutes.
73,L600,u3,m0,CHASTITY,All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
74,L599,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?"
75,L598,u3,m0,CHASTITY,"Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding."
76,L597,u0,m0,BIANCA,Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
77,L596,u3,m0,CHASTITY,Is he oily or dry?
78,L595,u0,m0,BIANCA,"He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation."
79,L580,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?"
80,L579,u3,m0,CHASTITY,Great
81,L573,u0,m0,BIANCA,Joey.
82,L572,u3,m0,CHASTITY,Who?
83,L571,u0,m0,BIANCA,Where did he go?  He was just here.
84,L51,u0,m0,BIANCA,You might wanna think about it
85,L50,u3,m0,CHASTITY,No.
86,L49,u0,m0,BIANCA,Did you change your hair?
87,L760,u0,m0,BIANCA,You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
88,L759,u4,m0,JOEY,"Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom."
89,L758,u4,m0,JOEY,You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
90,L757,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Hi, Joey."
91,L756,u4,m0,JOEY,"Hey, sweet cheeks."
92,L593,u4,m0,JOEY,My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
93,L592,u0,m0,BIANCA,Neat...
94,L591,u4,m0,JOEY,"It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff."
95,L590,u0,m0,BIANCA,Queen Harry?
96,L589,u4,m0,JOEY,"So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig "" that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week."
97,L397,u0,m0,BIANCA,Hopefully.
98,L396,u4,m0,JOEY,"Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?"
99,L395,u0,m0,BIANCA,Expensive?
100,L394,u4,m0,JOEY,It's more
101,L1052,u5,m0,KAT,Perm?
102,L1051,u0,m0,BIANCA,Patrick -- is that- a.
103,L1022,u5,m0,KAT,It's just you.
104,L1021,u0,m0,BIANCA,Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
105,L1011,u0,m0,BIANCA,No! I just wanted
106,L1010,u5,m0,KAT,What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
107,L1009,u0,m0,BIANCA,I just wanted --
108,L1008,u5,m0,KAT,You set me up.
109,L1007,u0,m0,BIANCA,Let go!
110,L983,u5,m0,KAT,So did you
111,L982,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You looked beautiful last night, you know."
112,L914,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I guess I'll never know, will I?"
113,L913,u5,m0,KAT,"Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to."
114,L912,u0,m0,BIANCA,"God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself"
115,L911,u5,m0,KAT,I guess I thought I was protecting you.
116,L910,u0,m0,BIANCA,I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
117,L909,u5,m0,KAT,That's not
118,L908,u0,m0,BIANCA,"No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage."
119,L907,u5,m0,KAT,I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
120,L906,u0,m0,BIANCA,Why didn't you tell me?
121,L905,u5,m0,KAT,"After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"
122,L904,u0,m0,BIANCA,But
123,L903,u5,m0,KAT,"Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me."
124,L902,u0,m0,BIANCA,You did what?
125,L901,u5,m0,KAT,He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
126,L900,u0,m0,BIANCA,As in...
127,L899,u5,m0,KAT,"Now I do.  Back then, was a different story."
128,L898,u0,m0,BIANCA,But you hate Joey
129,L897,u5,m0,KAT,"He was, like, a total babe"
130,L896,u0,m0,BIANCA,Why?
131,L895,u5,m0,KAT,In 9th.  For a month
132,L894,u0,m0,BIANCA,What?
133,L893,u5,m0,KAT,"Joey never told you we went out, did he?"
134,L892,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t."
135,L891,u5,m0,KAT,"I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s ."
136,L890,u0,m0,BIANCA,Like you care.
137,L889,u5,m0,KAT,"Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School."
138,L656,u5,m0,KAT,You're welcome.
139,L655,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here."
140,L602,u0,m0,BIANCA,I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
141,L601,u5,m0,KAT,"Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --"
142,L543,u5,m0,KAT,Can we go now?
143,L542,u0,m0,BIANCA,You are so completely unbalanced.
144,L533,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too."
145,L532,u5,m0,KAT,It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
146,L531,u0,m0,BIANCA,Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
147,L530,u5,m0,KAT,At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
148,L529,u0,m0,BIANCA,Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
149,L527,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that."
150,L526,u5,m0,KAT,What's normal?
151,L525,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal."
152,L445,u0,m0,BIANCA,I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
153,L444,u5,m0,KAT,What do you think?
154,L443,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?"
155,L442,u5,m0,KAT,It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
156,L441,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?"
157,L320,u0,m0,BIANCA,Can you at least start wearing a bra?
158,L319,u5,m0,KAT,I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
159,L165,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Nowhere... Hi, Daddy."
160,L164,u5,m0,KAT,Where've you been?
161,L923,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know."
162,L922,u11,m0,WALTER,I'm missing something.
163,L884,u0,m0,BIANCA,Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
164,L883,u11,m0,WALTER,You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
165,L882,u0,m0,BIANCA,"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."
166,L881,u11,m0,WALTER,"It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?"
167,L880,u0,m0,BIANCA,"No, but"
168,L879,u11,m0,WALTER,The prom?  Kat has a date?
169,L878,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --"
170,L546,u11,m0,WALTER,Because she'll scare them away.
171,L545,u0,m0,BIANCA,Why?
172,L544,u11,m0,WALTER,Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
173,L540,u11,m0,WALTER,Just for a minute
174,L539,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Daddy, no!"
175,L538,u11,m0,WALTER,Wear the belly before you go.
176,L537,u0,m0,BIANCA,It's just a party. Daddy.
177,L536,u11,m0,WALTER,"Oh, God.  It's starting."
178,L524,u11,m0,WALTER,"If Kat's not going, you're not going."
179,L523,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Daddy, people expect me to be there!"
180,L521,u0,m0,BIANCA,"It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria Steinem"" over there isn't going --"
181,L520,u11,m0,WALTER,Otherwise known as an orgy?
182,L519,u0,m0,BIANCA,"If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends."
183,L518,u11,m0,WALTER,And where're you going?
184,L517,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Daddy, I --"
185,L190,u11,m0,WALTER,Exactly my point
186,L189,u0,m0,BIANCA,But she doesn't want to date.
187,L183,u0,m0,BIANCA,"But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!"
188,L182,u11,m0,WALTER,Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
189,L181,u0,m0,BIANCA,What if she never starts dating?
190,L180,u11,m0,WALTER,No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
191,L179,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask..."
192,L463,u1,m0,BRUCE,Just sent 'em through.
193,L462,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?"
194,L461,u1,m0,BRUCE,Never
195,L460,u9,m0,PATRICK,Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
196,L459,u1,m0,BRUCE,Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
197,L458,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Always a pleasure, Brucie."
198,L779,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile."
199,L778,u2,m0,CAMERON,You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
200,L586,u2,m0,CAMERON,"No, I ' m not."
201,L585,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress."
202,L584,u2,m0,CAMERON,The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
203,L583,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
204,L500,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -"
205,L499,u7,m0,MICHAEL,You told me that part already.
206,L433,u2,m0,CAMERON,It's her favorite band.
207,L432,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Assail your ears for one night.
208,L425,u2,m0,CAMERON,Okay!  I wasn't sure
209,L424,u7,m0,MICHAEL,He's pretty!
210,L419,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Dead at forty-one.
211,L418,u2,m0,CAMERON,Her favorite uncle
212,L417,u7,m0,MICHAEL,It's a lung cancer issue
213,L416,u2,m0,CAMERON,Number one.  She hates smokers
214,L391,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
215,L390,u2,m0,CAMERON,Will Bogey get bent?
216,L389,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out."
217,L388,u2,m0,CAMERON,This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
218,L245,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca."
219,L244,u2,m0,CAMERON,You got him involved?
220,L225,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
221,L224,u2,m0,CAMERON,I thought you hated those people.
222,L223,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side."
223,L222,u2,m0,CAMERON,That's what I just said
224,L221,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
225,L220,u2,m0,CAMERON,Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
226,L219,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers."
227,L218,u2,m0,CAMERON,They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
228,L217,u7,m0,MICHAEL,No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
229,L216,u2,m0,CAMERON,He seems like he thrives on danger
230,L215,u7,m0,MICHAEL,What makes you think he'll do it?
231,L213,u7,m0,MICHAEL,You wanna go out with him?
232,L212,u2,m0,CAMERON,What about him?
233,L211,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?"
234,L210,u2,m0,CAMERON,"I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me."
235,L159,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"The mewling, rampalian wretch herself."
236,L158,u2,m0,CAMERON,That's her?  Bianca's sister?
237,L157,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew."
238,L147,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"You could consecrate with her, my friend."
239,L146,u2,m0,CAMERON,You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
240,L145,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
241,L144,u2,m0,CAMERON,Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
242,L143,u7,m0,MICHAEL,You know French?
243,L142,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out."
244,L141,u2,m0,CAMERON,He always have that shit-eating grin?
245,L140,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted."
246,L139,u2,m0,CAMERON,Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
247,L92,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility."
248,L91,u2,m0,CAMERON,Why not?
249,L90,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
250,L89,u2,m0,CAMERON,Who is she?
251,L88,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"You burn, you pine, you perish?"
252,L87,u2,m0,CAMERON,That girl -- I --
253,L78,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood."
254,L77,u2,m0,CAMERON,That I'm used to.
255,L74,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Couple thousand. Most of them evil
256,L73,u2,m0,CAMERON,How many people go here?
257,L72,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Get out!
258,L71,u2,m0,CAMERON,Thirty-two.
259,L70,u7,m0,MICHAEL,How many people were in your old school?
260,L69,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though."
261,L68,u7,m0,MICHAEL,I was kidding. People actually live there?
262,L67,u2,m0,CAMERON,"North, actually.  How'd you   ?"
263,L66,u7,m0,MICHAEL,So -- which Dakota you from?
264,L65,u7,m0,MICHAEL,C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
265,L64,u2,m0,CAMERON,So they tell me...
266,L63,u7,m0,MICHAEL,You the new guy?
267,L781,u2,m0,CAMERON,You get the girl.
268,L780,u9,m0,PATRICK,What's the worst?
269,L745,u9,m0,PATRICK,Where?
270,L744,u2,m0,CAMERON,She kissed me.
271,L743,u9,m0,PATRICK,You makin' any headway?
272,L741,u9,m0,PATRICK,She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
273,L740,u2,m0,CAMERON,She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
274,L726,u9,m0,PATRICK,I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
275,L725,u2,m0,CAMERON,What'd you do to her?
276,L625,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Then, go get her"
277,L624,u2,m0,CAMERON,Sure
278,L623,u9,m0,PATRICK,Cameron -- do you like the girl?
279,L622,u2,m0,CAMERON,"She's partial to Joey, not me"
280,L621,u9,m0,PATRICK,What 're you talking about?
281,L620,u2,m0,CAMERON,It's off. The whole thing.
282,L619,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Cameron, I'm a little busy"
283,L431,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Don't make me do it, man"
284,L430,u2,m0,CAMERON,Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
285,L427,u9,m0,PATRICK,So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
286,L426,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and ""angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion""."
287,L412,u2,m0,CAMERON,I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
288,L411,u9,m0,PATRICK,What've you got for me?
289,L386,u9,m0,PATRICK,Yeah -- we'll see.
290,L385,u2,m0,CAMERON,And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
291,L558,u4,m0,JOEY,And why would I do that?
292,L557,u5,m0,KAT,Leave my sister alone.
293,L556,u4,m0,JOEY,Your sister here?
294,L555,u5,m0,KAT,Away.
295,L554,u4,m0,JOEY,Where ya goin?
296,L336,u4,m0,JOEY,Not at all
297,L335,u5,m0,KAT,Hey -- do you mind?
298,L150,u4,m0,JOEY,They're running the rest of me next month.
299,L149,u5,m0,KAT,"Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break."
300,L148,u4,m0,JOEY,"The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?"
301,L748,u4,m0,JOEY,Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
302,L747,u9,m0,PATRICK,"I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --"
303,L609,u4,m0,JOEY,Get her to act like a human
304,L608,u9,m0,PATRICK,Do what?
305,L607,u4,m0,JOEY,How'd you do it?
306,L606,u4,m0,JOEY,A deal's a deal.
307,L605,u9,m0,PATRICK,It's about time.
308,L358,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Forget her sister, then."
309,L357,u4,m0,JOEY,Forget it.
310,L356,u9,m0,PATRICK,A hundred bucks a date.
311,L355,u4,m0,JOEY,What?
312,L354,u9,m0,PATRICK,I just upped my price
313,L352,u9,m0,PATRICK,I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
314,L351,u4,m0,JOEY,Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
315,L350,u9,m0,PATRICK,I'm on it
316,L349,u4,m0,JOEY,"When I shell out fifty, I expect results."
317,L301,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Fifty, and you've got your man."
318,L300,u4,m0,JOEY,Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
319,L299,u4,m0,JOEY,"Fine, thirty."
320,L298,u9,m0,PATRICK,I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
321,L297,u9,m0,PATRICK,How much?
322,L296,u4,m0,JOEY,I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
323,L295,u9,m0,PATRICK,You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
324,L294,u4,m0,JOEY,"You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors."
325,L292,u4,m0,JOEY,But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
326,L291,u9,m0,PATRICK,You need money to take a girl out
327,L290,u4,m0,JOEY,You just said
328,L289,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it."
329,L288,u4,m0,JOEY,"Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her."
330,L287,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Two legs, nice rack..."
331,L286,u4,m0,JOEY,What do you think?
332,L285,u9,m0,PATRICK,Yeah
333,L509,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
334,L508,u4,m0,JOEY,You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
335,L505,u7,m0,MICHAEL,What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
336,L504,u4,m0,JOEY,You and Verona?
337,L503,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*"
338,L502,u4,m0,JOEY,I hear you're helpin' Verona.
339,L240,u7,m0,MICHAEL,So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
340,L239,u4,m0,JOEY,Does this conversation have a purpose?
341,L238,u7,m0,MICHAEL,But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
342,L236,u4,m0,JOEY,We're not.
343,L235,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested."
344,L234,u4,m0,JOEY,We don't chat.
345,L233,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Nope - just came by to chat
346,L232,u4,m0,JOEY,Are you lost?
347,L231,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Hey.
348,L949,u5,m0,KAT,"Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations."
349,L948,u6,m0,MANDELLA,William - he asked me to meet him here.
350,L947,u5,m0,KAT,Who?
351,L946,u6,m0,MANDELLA,Have you seen him?
352,L755,u6,m0,MANDELLA,"Oh, good.  Something new and different for us."
353,L754,u5,m0,KAT,You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
354,L753,u6,m0,MANDELLA,"Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway"
355,L752,u5,m0,KAT,"Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica."
356,L751,u6,m0,MANDELLA,"Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates ."
357,L750,u5,m0,KAT,Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
358,L721,u5,m0,KAT,I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
359,L720,u6,m0,MANDELLA,You didn't
360,L719,u5,m0,KAT,I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
361,L718,u6,m0,MANDELLA,You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
362,L717,u5,m0,KAT,I didn't have a choice.
363,L716,u6,m0,MANDELLA,You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
364,L491,u5,m0,KAT,Who cares?
365,L490,u6,m0,MANDELLA,What'd he say?
366,L448,u5,m0,KAT,No fear.
367,L447,u6,m0,MANDELLA,You think this'll work?
368,L254,u5,m0,KAT,"If I was Bianca, it would be, ""Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."""
369,L253,u6,m0,MANDELLA,Does it matter?
370,L252,u5,m0,KAT,"I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?"
371,L251,u5,m0,KAT,Neither has his heterosexuality.
372,L250,u6,m0,MANDELLA,That's never been proven
373,L249,u5,m0,KAT,William didn't even go to high school
374,L248,u6,m0,MANDELLA,William would never have gone to a state school.
375,L247,u5,m0,KAT,"So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all."
376,L152,u6,m0,MANDELLA,You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
377,L151,u5,m0,KAT,The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
378,L134,u6,m0,MANDELLA,But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
379,L133,u5,m0,KAT,"I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy."
380,L132,u6,m0,MANDELLA,An attempted slit.
381,L131,u5,m0,KAT,What's this?
382,L130,u6,m0,MANDELLA,Just a little.
383,L129,u5,m0,KAT,"Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die."
384,L128,u5,m0,KAT,Block E?
385,L127,u6,m0,MANDELLA,He always look so
386,L126,u5,m0,KAT,I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
387,L125,u6,m0,MANDELLA,That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
388,L124,u5,m0,KAT,Patrick Verona   Random skid.
389,L123,u6,m0,MANDELLA,Who's that?
390,L1043,u9,m0,PATRICK,Don ' t you even dare. . .
391,L1042,u5,m0,KAT,"Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?"
392,L1041,u9,m0,PATRICK,Because I like to torture you.
393,L1040,u5,m0,KAT,Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
394,L1035,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her."
395,L1034,u5,m0,KAT,Is that right?
396,L1033,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl."
397,L1032,u9,m0,PATRICK,I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
398,L1031,u5,m0,KAT,A Fender Strat. You bought this?
399,L977,u9,m0,PATRICK,I didn't care about the money.
400,L976,u5,m0,KAT,"Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?"
401,L975,u9,m0,PATRICK,It wasn't like that.
402,L974,u5,m0,KAT,You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
403,L973,u9,m0,PATRICK,Wait I...
404,L961,u9,m0,PATRICK,It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
405,L960,u5,m0,KAT,That ' s completely adorable!
406,L959,u9,m0,PATRICK,"That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story."
407,L958,u5,m0,KAT,What?
408,L957,u9,m0,PATRICK,My grandmother's .
409,L940,u5,m0,KAT,"Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong."
410,L939,u9,m0,PATRICK,Oh huh
411,L938,u5,m0,KAT,It's just something I had.  You know
412,L937,u9,m0,PATRICK,It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
413,L936,u5,m0,KAT,How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
414,L857,u9,m0,PATRICK,Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
415,L856,u5,m0,KAT,"Answer the question, Patrick"
416,L855,u9,m0,PATRICK,You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
417,L854,u5,m0,KAT,You tell me.
418,L853,u9,m0,PATRICK,So I have to have a motive to be with you?
419,L852,u5,m0,KAT,Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
420,L848,u5,m0,KAT,Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
421,L847,u9,m0,PATRICK,Why not?
422,L846,u5,m0,KAT,"No, I won't go with you"
423,L845,u9,m0,PATRICK,No what?
424,L844,u5,m0,KAT,No.
425,L843,u9,m0,PATRICK,You know what I mean
426,L842,u5,m0,KAT,Is that a request or a command?
427,L841,u9,m0,PATRICK,Go to the prom with me
428,L840,u5,m0,KAT,You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
429,L839,u9,m0,PATRICK,No one else knows
430,L838,u5,m0,KAT,What?
431,L837,u9,m0,PATRICK,You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
432,L836,u5,m0,KAT,No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
433,L835,u9,m0,PATRICK,I hate peas.
434,L834,u5,m0,KAT,Tell me something true.
435,L832,u5,m0,KAT,I know the porn career's a lie.
436,L831,u9,m0,PATRICK,Hearsay.
437,L830,u5,m0,KAT,The duck?
438,L829,u9,m0,PATRICK,Fallacy.
439,L828,u5,m0,KAT,State trooper?
440,L825,u5,m0,KAT,For. . . ?
441,L824,u9,m0,PATRICK,You up for it?
442,L823,u9,m0,PATRICK,You never disappointed me.
443,L822,u5,m0,KAT,How?
444,L821,u9,m0,PATRICK,Then you screwed up
445,L820,u5,m0,KAT,Something like that
446,L819,u9,m0,PATRICK,"So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?"
447,L818,u5,m0,KAT,I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
448,L817,u9,m0,PATRICK,Yes
449,L816,u5,m0,KAT,Acting the way we do.
450,L815,u9,m0,PATRICK,So what's your excuse?
451,L814,u5,m0,KAT,"Yeah, well, don't let it get out"
452,L813,u9,m0,PATRICK,A soft side? Who knew?
453,L812,u5,m0,KAT,I dazzled him with my wit
454,L811,u9,m0,PATRICK,So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
455,L810,u5,m0,KAT,Good call.
456,L809,u9,m0,PATRICK,I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
457,L808,u5,m0,KAT,The Partridge Family?
458,L806,u9,m0,PATRICK,Maybe.
459,L805,u5,m0,KAT,You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
460,L804,u9,m0,PATRICK,Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
461,L803,u5,m0,KAT,Put your right foot there --
462,L802,u9,m0,PATRICK,Try lookin' at it from this angle
463,L801,u5,m0,KAT,C'mon.  It's not that bad
464,L800,u9,m0,PATRICK,I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
465,L799,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Look up, sunshine"
466,L798,u5,m0,KAT,He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
467,L774,u5,m0,KAT,Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
468,L773,u9,m0,PATRICK,So what did I have an effect on ?
469,L772,u5,m0,KAT,Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
470,L771,u9,m0,PATRICK,Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
471,L770,u5,m0,KAT,Unwelcome.
472,L769,u9,m0,PATRICK,Wholesome.
473,L768,u9,m0,PATRICK,Pleasant?
474,L767,u5,m0,KAT,You 're so --
475,L766,u9,m0,PATRICK,I heard there was a poetry reading.
476,L765,u5,m0,KAT,What are you doing here?
477,L764,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy."
478,L690,u9,m0,PATRICK,"No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ..."
479,L689,u5,m0,KAT,BIANCA
480,L688,u9,m0,PATRICK,Who?
481,L687,u5,m0,KAT,He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
482,L686,u9,m0,PATRICK,So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
483,L684,u9,m0,PATRICK,I'm gettin' there
484,L683,u5,m0,KAT,"Oh, so now you think you know me?"
485,L682,u9,m0,PATRICK,You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
486,L681,u5,m0,KAT,My father wouldn't approve of that that
487,L680,u9,m0,PATRICK,Start a band?
488,L679,u5,m0,KAT,This.
489,L678,u9,m0,PATRICK,Do what?
490,L677,u5,m0,KAT,I should do this.
491,L676,u5,m0,KAT,Why'd you lie?
492,L675,u9,m0,PATRICK,Then why'd you ask?
493,L674,u5,m0,KAT,"No, you weren't"
494,L673,u9,m0,PATRICK,Maybe.
495,L672,u5,m0,KAT,Were you in jail?
496,L671,u9,m0,PATRICK,Busy
497,L670,u5,m0,KAT,When you were gone last year -- where were you?
498,L669,u5,m0,KAT,But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
499,L668,u9,m0,PATRICK,And I'm in control of it.
500,L651,u5,m0,KAT,What?
501,L650,u9,m0,PATRICK,Kat! Wake up!
502,L646,u5,m0,KAT,You know what they say
503,L645,u9,m0,PATRICK,I thought you were above all that
504,L644,u5,m0,KAT,"Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?"
505,L643,u9,m0,PATRICK,I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
506,L642,u5,m0,KAT,I hate him.
507,L641,u9,m0,PATRICK,Dorsey.
508,L640,u5,m0,KAT,Who?
509,L639,u9,m0,PATRICK,Why'd you let him get to you?
510,L636,u5,m0,KAT,Just let me sit down.
511,L635,u9,m0,PATRICK,See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
512,L634,u5,m0,KAT,Like you could find one
513,L633,u9,m0,PATRICK,Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
514,L632,u5,m0,KAT,Why?
515,L631,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Sure, I do"
516,L630,u5,m0,KAT,You don't care if I die
517,L629,u9,m0,PATRICK,I told you
518,L628,u5,m0,KAT,Why 're you doing this?
519,L627,u9,m0,PATRICK,Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
520,L626,u5,m0,KAT,This is so patronizing.
521,L616,u9,m0,PATRICK,What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
522,L615,u5,m0,KAT,"I know, just let me sleep"
523,L614,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep"
524,L613,u5,m0,KAT,I just need to lie down for awhile
525,L612,u9,m0,PATRICK,You're not okay.
526,L611,u5,m0,KAT,I'm fine. I'm
527,L610,u9,m0,PATRICK,Okay?
528,L567,u5,m0,KAT,"Funny, you're the only one"
529,L566,u9,m0,PATRICK,"I say, do what you wanna do."
530,L565,u5,m0,KAT,"""I'm getting trashed, man."" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?"
531,L564,u9,m0,PATRICK,What's this?
532,L483,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Why, don't you?"
533,L482,u5,m0,KAT,You know who The Raincoats are?
534,L481,u9,m0,PATRICK,"You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there."
535,L477,u9,m0,PATRICK,Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
536,L476,u5,m0,KAT,"That's what you want, isn't it?"
537,L475,u9,m0,PATRICK,Excuse me?
538,L474,u5,m0,KAT,
539,L473,u9,m0,PATRICK,"hey.  Great show, huh?"
540,L334,u5,m0,KAT,Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
541,L333,u9,m0,PATRICK,"You're not a big talker, are you?"
542,L332,u5,m0,KAT,Hi
543,L331,u9,m0,PATRICK,I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
544,L330,u5,m0,KAT,Are you following me?
545,L328,u9,m0,PATRICK,Seven-thirty?
546,L327,u5,m0,KAT,You -- covered in my vomit.
547,L326,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass..."
548,L325,u5,m0,KAT,And why would I do that?
549,L324,u9,m0,PATRICK,Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
550,L323,u5,m0,KAT,I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
551,L322,u9,m0,PATRICK,You hate me don't you?
552,L313,u9,m0,PATRICK,I know a lot more than that
553,L312,u5,m0,KAT,"Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?"
554,L311,u9,m0,PATRICK,The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
555,L310,u5,m0,KAT,"Oh, right.  Friday."
556,L309,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Pick you up Friday, then"
557,L307,u5,m0,KAT,My mission in life.
558,L306,u9,m0,PATRICK,There's a way to get a guy's attention.
559,L305,u5,m0,KAT,"Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?"
560,L304,u9,m0,PATRICK,I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
561,L1000,u11,m0,WALTER,"Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check."
562,L999,u5,m0,KAT,When I go?
563,L998,u11,m0,WALTER,"You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game."
564,L997,u11,m0,WALTER,No -- impressed.
565,L996,u5,m0,KAT,What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
566,L995,u11,m0,WALTER,Bianca did what?
567,L994,u5,m0,KAT,The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
568,L993,u11,m0,WALTER,Which parts?
569,L992,u5,m0,KAT,Parts of it.
570,L991,u11,m0,WALTER,So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
571,L990,u5,m0,KAT,"No, Daddy."
572,L989,u11,m0,WALTER,I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
573,L988,u11,m0,WALTER,Funny.
574,L987,u5,m0,KAT,Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
575,L986,u11,m0,WALTER,Was that your sister?
576,L347,u5,m0,KAT,I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
577,L346,u11,m0,WALTER,You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
578,L345,u5,m0,KAT,So what I want doesn't matter?
579,L344,u11,m0,WALTER,"As a parent, that's my right"
580,L343,u5,m0,KAT,Because you're making decisions for me.
581,L342,u11,m0,WALTER,Why can't we agree on this?
582,L341,u5,m0,KAT,I thought you were punishing me.
583,L340,u11,m0,WALTER,Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
584,L339,u5,m0,KAT,Then tell them I had a seizure.
585,L338,u11,m0,WALTER,My insurance does not cover PMS
586,L185,u11,m0,WALTER,Enough!
587,L184,u5,m0,KAT,This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
588,L174,u5,m0,KAT,You decided.
589,L173,u11,m0,WALTER,I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
590,L172,u5,m0,KAT,I know.
591,L1018,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,Just smack her now.
592,L1017,u5,m0,KAT,"Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?"
593,L109,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,"No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the term used most often."
594,L108,u5,m0,KAT,Tempestuous?
595,L107,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
596,L106,u5,m0,KAT,I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
597,L105,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,"Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested."
598,L104,u5,m0,KAT,Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
599,L103,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,"Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again."
600,L738,u6,m0,MANDELLA,Yeah...
601,L737,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Kat a fan, too?"
602,L736,u6,m0,MANDELLA,Right.
603,L735,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Macbeth, right?"
604,L733,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Oh yeah.
605,L732,u6,m0,MANDELLA,You think?
606,L731,u6,m0,MANDELLA,Yeah.  I guess.
607,L730,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Cool pictures.  You a fan?
608,L729,u6,m0,MANDELLA,Hi.
609,L728,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
610,L777,u9,m0,PATRICK,Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
611,L776,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Sweet love, renew thy force!"
612,L775,u9,m0,PATRICK,You were right. She's still pissed.
613,L724,u9,m0,PATRICK,No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
614,L723,u7,m0,MICHAEL,So you got cozy with she who stings?
615,L437,u9,m0,PATRICK,I'm likin' you guys better
616,L436,u7,m0,MICHAEL,I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
617,L429,u9,m0,PATRICK,Yeah.
618,L428,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Ever been to Club Skunk?
619,L421,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Just for now.
620,L420,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Are you telling me I'm a -  ""non-smoker""?"
621,L415,u7,m0,MICHAEL,Good enough.
622,L414,u9,m0,PATRICK,What?!
623,L384,u7,m0,MICHAEL,We're your guys.
624,L383,u9,m0,PATRICK,You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
625,L382,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl."
626,L381,u9,m0,PATRICK,So Dorsey can get the girl?
627,L380,u7,m0,MICHAEL,That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
628,L379,u9,m0,PATRICK,Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
629,L378,u7,m0,MICHAEL,I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
630,L377,u9,m0,PATRICK,What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
631,L376,u7,m0,MICHAEL,"The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford."
632,L375,u9,m0,PATRICK,What plan?
633,L373,u9,m0,PATRICK,Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
634,L372,u7,m0,MICHAEL,What?
635,L371,u9,m0,PATRICK,Say it
636,L512,u9,m0,PATRICK,See you next week!
637,L511,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,You're completely demented.
638,L264,u9,m0,PATRICK,"Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good..."
639,L263,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,"You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?"
640,L262,u9,m0,PATRICK,What's to discuss?
641,L261,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
642,L259,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,"I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?"
643,L258,u9,m0,PATRICK,Touch of the flu.
644,L257,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,"I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?"
645,L62,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,With the teeth of your zipper?
646,L61,u9,m0,PATRICK,It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
647,L60,u8,m0,MISS PERKY,It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
648,L59,u9,m0,PATRICK,I missed you.
649,L933,u11,m0,WALTER,That ' s what I thought
650,L932,u10,m0,SHARON,Absolutely not.
651,L931,u11,m0,WALTER,Did I have anything to say about it?
652,L930,u10,m0,SHARON,Your daughters went to the prom.
653,L929,u11,m0,WALTER,What just happened?
654,L927,u11,m0,WALTER,But -- who -- what --?
655,L926,u10,m0,SHARON,"Have a great time, honey!"
656,L918,u10,m0,SHARON,Dr. Ruth?
657,L917,u11,m0,WALTER,"What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap"
658,L887,u11,m0,WALTER,Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
659,L886,u10,m0,SHARON,"They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go."
660,L877,u11,m0,WALTER,Pirate -- no question.
661,L876,u10,m0,SHARON,Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
662,L193,u11,m0,WALTER,You're not helping.
663,L192,u10,m0,SHARON,Tumescent!
664,L191,u11,m0,WALTER,Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
665,L171,u11,m0,WALTER,Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
666,L170,u10,m0,SHARON,What's a synonym for throbbing?
667,L162,u11,m0,WALTER,Make anyone cry today?
668,L161,u10,m0,SHARON,In the microwave.
669,L2181,u12,m1,ALONSO,"Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign..."
670,L2180,u23,m1,SAILOR,"We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near."
671,L2179,u12,m1,ALONSO,We should have seen land.
672,L2177,u23,m1,SAILOR,We'll all go crazy...
673,L2176,u12,m1,ALONSO,He's the devil's child...
674,L2175,u12,m1,ALONSO,With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
675,L2174,u23,m1,SAILOR,"Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm."
676,L2173,u12,m1,ALONSO,"What are you listening to, chicken ass?"
677,L2172,u12,m1,ALONSO,You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
678,L2171,u23,m1,SAILOR,The water's going putrid in the barrels.
679,L2170,u12,m1,ALONSO,I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
680,L2025,u13,m1,AROJAZ,IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
681,L2024,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
682,L2023,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
683,L2022,u13,m1,AROJAZ,Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
684,L2020,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
685,L2019,u13,m1,AROJAZ,"If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?"
686,L2016,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God."
687,L2015,u13,m1,AROJAZ,Is that all that interests you? Gold?
688,L2014,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold."
689,L2012,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"If they agree to follow me, yes."
690,L2011,u13,m1,AROJAZ,"Your life, and that of others!"
691,L2010,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible."
692,L2006,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Excellency, you are right."
693,L2005,u13,m1,AROJAZ,"Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment."
694,L1993,u13,m1,AROJAZ,"Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable."
695,L1992,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"I am, Your Eminence"
696,L1991,u13,m1,AROJAZ,"Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?"
697,L1990,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks."
698,L1989,u13,m1,AROJAZ,You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
699,L2524,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his."
700,L2523,u13,m1,AROJAZ,What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
701,L2522,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,You can see for yourself.
702,L2275,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross."
703,L2274,u13,m1,AROJAZ,"It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez."
704,L2031,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain."
705,L2030,u13,m1,AROJAZ,He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
706,L2029,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
707,L2028,u13,m1,AROJAZ,The Judgment is ours!
708,L2027,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence..."
709,L2540,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
710,L2539,u14,m1,BEATRIX,"What is it, now?  Tell me..."
711,L2538,u14,m1,BEATRIX,I am busy inside.
712,L2537,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Can't you stay with us a little?
713,L2474,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier..."
714,L2473,u14,m1,BEATRIX,They took everything...
715,L2472,u14,m1,BEATRIX,They tried... but I didn't let them.
716,L2471,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
717,L2320,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
718,L2319,u14,m1,BEATRIX,You don't usually ask.
719,L2318,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Beatrix, I want to ask you something."
720,L2123,u14,m1,BEATRIX,That's something you can't decide.
721,L2122,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I don't want you to wait for me.
722,L2121,u14,m1,BEATRIX,I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
723,L2119,u14,m1,BEATRIX,Thank God...
724,L2118,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,She said yes.
725,L1986,u14,m1,BEATRIX,I find that hard to believe.
726,L1985,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
727,L1984,u14,m1,BEATRIX,I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
728,L1983,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Are we going to argue?
729,L1982,u14,m1,BEATRIX,Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
730,L1981,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I haven't given you much of a life.
731,L1980,u14,m1,BEATRIX,I know.
732,L1979,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I could be gone for years.
733,L2432,u15,m1,BOBADILLA,I am afraid this is not the worst news.
734,L2431,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
735,L2430,u15,m1,BOBADILLA,I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
736,L2429,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,How far from here?
737,L2426,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
738,L2425,u15,m1,BOBADILLA,Viceroy of the West Indies.
739,L2424,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Appointment to what?
740,L2423,u15,m1,BOBADILLA,My letters of appointment.
741,L2422,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Yes... I remember...
742,L2421,u15,m1,BOBADILLA,Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
743,L2293,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
744,L2292,u15,m1,BOBADILLA,May I ask by whom?
745,L2291,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken."
746,L2290,u15,m1,BOBADILLA,I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
747,L2552,u17,m1,FERNANDO,Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
748,L2551,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
749,L2550,u17,m1,FERNANDO,"I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything."
750,L2549,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,He never had one... except aboard my ships!
751,L2548,u17,m1,FERNANDO,He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
752,L2547,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,What does he say?
753,L2542,u17,m1,FERNANDO,"I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing."
754,L2541,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,What are you listening to?
755,L2501,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,There must be a passage to that other ocean.
756,L2500,u17,m1,FERNANDO,Father...
757,L2485,u17,m1,FERNANDO,Not bad.
758,L2484,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"How are you feeling, Fernando?"
759,L2440,u17,m1,FERNANDO,This time with me!
760,L2439,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I have to explore the mainland.
761,L2131,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!"
762,L2130,u17,m1,FERNANDO,Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
763,L2129,u17,m1,FERNANDO,You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
764,L2128,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,There'll be a time.
765,L2127,u17,m1,FERNANDO,I want to go with you!
766,L2469,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,All of them created by people like me.
767,L2468,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"Roofs... towers, palaces... spires..."
768,L2467,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,What do you see?
769,L2466,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Look out of that window.
770,L2465,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
771,L2464,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Call them.
772,L2463,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,All I have to do is call the guards.
773,L2301,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way."
774,L2300,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,What...?  Do I have so many already?
775,L2299,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
776,L2297,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
777,L2296,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal."
778,L2295,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
779,L2287,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,... for a commoner?
780,L2286,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,You defend yourself admirably...
781,L2282,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?"
782,L2281,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And..."
783,L2110,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will."
784,L2109,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?"
785,L2108,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,Then you are too ambitious.
786,L2107,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I'm not bargaining!
787,L2106,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me."
788,L2105,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!"
789,L2104,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,No?
790,L2103,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,No...
791,L2410,u25,m1,UTAPAN,You never learned how to speak my language.
792,L2409,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me."
793,L2394,u25,m1,UTAPAN,You did the same to your God!
794,L2393,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!"
795,L2343,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Ask him if he will help.
796,L2342,u25,m1,UTAPAN,He understands.
797,L2341,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
798,L2260,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
799,L2259,u25,m1,UTAPAN,Chief says...
800,L2258,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,... and also to bring medicine.
801,L2257,u25,m1,UTAPAN,Chief says -- he has a God.
802,L2256,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,To bring the word of God.
803,L2255,u25,m1,UTAPAN,Why?
804,L2254,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Thousands.
805,L2253,u25,m1,UTAPAN,Chief says -- how many?
806,L2251,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
807,L2250,u25,m1,UTAPAN,Chief knows.
808,L2249,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Tell the Chief we thank him.
809,L2248,u25,m1,UTAPAN,You come!  You speak first!
810,L2239,u25,m1,UTAPAN,Island.  Far.
811,L2238,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
812,L2237,u25,m1,UTAPAN,Say not here!  Cuba!
813,L2535,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
814,L2534,u19,m1,MARCHENA,Oh?  So you are a new man?
815,L2533,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,New worlds create new people.
816,L2532,u19,m1,MARCHENA,I knew you would.
817,L2531,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I have to disagree.
818,L2526,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"You'll always be older than me, Father."
819,L2525,u19,m1,MARCHENA,I suppose we're both old men now.
820,L2145,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Give me absolution.
821,L2144,u19,m1,MARCHENA,I believed in you...
822,L2143,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"You are bound by an oath, Father."
823,L2142,u19,m1,MARCHENA,"My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will."
824,L2141,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me..."
825,L2140,u19,m1,MARCHENA,May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
826,L2139,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
827,L2138,u19,m1,MARCHENA,How long?
828,L2137,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
829,L2136,u19,m1,MARCHENA,What are you saying?
830,L2135,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you."
831,L2134,u19,m1,MARCHENA,"I am listening, my son."
832,L2133,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned."
833,L2132,u19,m1,MARCHENA,"In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti."
834,L2046,u19,m1,MARCHENA,Colon!  Don't!
835,L2045,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,All of them!  Just lies!
836,L2042,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
837,L2041,u19,m1,MARCHENA,Colon!
838,L2040,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Damn God!
839,L2039,u19,m1,MARCHENA,"If God intends you to go, then you will go."
840,L2038,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
841,L2037,u19,m1,MARCHENA,You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
842,L1969,u19,m1,MARCHENA,"Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son."
843,L1968,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
844,L1967,u19,m1,MARCHENA,You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
845,L1966,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Passion is something one cannot control!
846,L1965,u19,m1,MARCHENA,Father Marchena!
847,L1964,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"I'll try to remember that, Marchena..."
848,L1963,u19,m1,MARCHENA,"Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon."
849,L1962,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,So was Christ!
850,L1961,u19,m1,MARCHENA,Esdras is a Jew.
851,L1960,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras..."
852,L1959,u19,m1,MARCHENA,How can you be so certain?
853,L1958,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
854,L1957,u19,m1,MARCHENA,How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
855,L1952,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
856,L1951,u19,m1,MARCHENA,Why do you wish to sail west?
857,L1950,u19,m1,MARCHENA,With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
858,L1949,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,How did you manage it?
859,L1948,u19,m1,MARCHENA,That's what it says.
860,L1947,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,God... That's in a week!
861,L1943,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself."
862,L1942,u19,m1,MARCHENA,"Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers..."
863,L2459,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
864,L2458,u18,m1,ISABEL,"There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?"
865,L2457,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Thank you.
866,L2456,u18,m1,ISABEL,But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
867,L2280,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
868,L2279,u18,m1,ISABEL,Do they have such thoughts?
869,L2086,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?"
870,L2085,u18,m1,ISABEL,"How old are you, Senor Colon?"
871,L2082,u18,m1,ISABEL,A woman?
872,L2081,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."
873,L2080,u18,m1,ISABEL,You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
874,L2079,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,May I speak freely?
875,L2077,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Surely you can do anything you want.
876,L2076,u18,m1,ISABEL,I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
877,L2075,u18,m1,ISABEL,That she was impregnable.
878,L2074,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,What did they say about Granada before today?
879,L2073,u18,m1,ISABEL,The ocean is uncrossable?
880,L2072,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
881,L2071,u18,m1,ISABEL,"I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool."
882,L2389,u21,m1,MOXICA,You will regret this.
883,L2388,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?"
884,L2387,u21,m1,MOXICA,Savagery is what monkeys understand.
885,L2386,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!"
886,L2348,u21,m1,MOXICA,"You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse."
887,L2347,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
888,L2346,u21,m1,MOXICA,My horse doesn't work.
889,L2345,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,We can't raise the wheel without it.
890,L2333,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for."
891,L2332,u21,m1,MOXICA,We don't need to know.
892,L2331,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
893,L2329,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say."
894,L2328,u21,m1,MOXICA,"We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood."
895,L2278,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica."
896,L2277,u21,m1,MOXICA,And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
897,L2492,u20,m1,MENDEZ,We can't be.
898,L2491,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
899,L2490,u20,m1,MENDEZ,What's he doing?
900,L2165,u20,m1,MENDEZ,Twenty eight.
901,L2164,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,What do you read?
902,L2160,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Come over here.
903,L2159,u20,m1,MENDEZ,"Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before."
904,L2158,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,And what do you think Mendez?
905,L2157,u20,m1,MENDEZ,"Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago..."
906,L2155,u20,m1,MENDEZ,God be with us admiral.
907,L2154,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us..."
908,L2211,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,You're right.  Let the men decide.
909,L2210,u22,m1,PINZON,You tell that to them!
910,L2209,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!"
911,L2208,u22,m1,PINZON,You bloody...
912,L2207,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?"
913,L2206,u22,m1,PINZON,Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
914,L2205,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!"
915,L2204,u22,m1,PINZON,"You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!"
916,L2203,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,The land is there.  I know it!
917,L2202,u22,m1,PINZON,We're lost!
918,L2201,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,You think I don't know that?
919,L2200,u22,m1,PINZON,"We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!"
920,L2199,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
921,L2198,u22,m1,PINZON,You must be mad...!
922,L2197,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,"Six days ago, yes."
923,L2196,u22,m1,PINZON,You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
924,L2065,u22,m1,PINZON,Immediately.
925,L2064,u16,m1,COLUMBUS,Where can I meet this man?
926,L2462,u18,m1,ISABEL,Because he is not afraid of me.
927,L2461,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,Then why?
928,L2460,u18,m1,ISABEL,"I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence."
929,L2419,u18,m1,ISABEL,"And who would you think of, for such a task?"
930,L2418,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,He must be replaced.
931,L2417,u18,m1,ISABEL,"Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?"
932,L2415,u18,m1,ISABEL,"Is this true, Brother Buyl?"
933,L2414,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
934,L2377,u18,m1,ISABEL,"We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time."
935,L2376,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty."
936,L2116,u18,m1,ISABEL,"Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!"
937,L2115,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,... Into a monk...
938,L2113,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"Never, Your Majesty.  Although..."
939,L2112,u18,m1,ISABEL,"You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted."
940,L1931,u24,m1,SANCHEZ,"Yes, Your Majesty."
941,L1930,u18,m1,ISABEL,"Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?"
942,L3546,u26,m2,CUTLER,"Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!"
943,L3545,u30,m2,EMIL,"...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital..."
944,L3497,u26,m2,CUTLER,"I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture."
945,L3496,u30,m2,EMIL,I'm abused.  Don't you think?
946,L3493,u26,m2,CUTLER,Can I see your back?
947,L3492,u30,m2,EMIL,Out on my back when I was a small boy.
948,L3491,u26,m2,CUTLER,Your father put cigarettes out on you?
949,L3490,u30,m2,EMIL,That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
950,L3489,u30,m2,EMIL,"Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?"
951,L3488,u26,m2,CUTLER,Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
952,L3487,u30,m2,EMIL,"Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness..."
953,L3486,u26,m2,CUTLER,Back in the Czech Republic?
954,L3485,u30,m2,EMIL,"Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me."
955,L3484,u26,m2,CUTLER,Your mother was blind?
956,L3483,u30,m2,EMIL,My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
957,L3482,u26,m2,CUTLER,Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
958,L3481,u30,m2,EMIL,"Give me another one, please."
959,L3480,u26,m2,CUTLER,I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
960,L3479,u30,m2,EMIL,What else do you need?
961,L3478,u26,m2,CUTLER,"This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me."
962,L3477,u30,m2,EMIL,Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
963,L3476,u26,m2,CUTLER,But it's...
964,L3475,u30,m2,EMIL,No.  No way.
965,L3474,u26,m2,CUTLER,I would say...half.  Half is fair.
966,L3473,u30,m2,EMIL,What's your cut?  How much?
967,L3472,u26,m2,CUTLER,"Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing."
968,L3471,u30,m2,EMIL,What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
969,L3470,u26,m2,CUTLER,Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
970,L3469,u30,m2,EMIL,"No, he is here.  Shit..."
971,L3468,u26,m2,CUTLER,Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
972,L3467,u30,m2,EMIL,What about Oleg?
973,L3466,u26,m2,CUTLER,"Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that."
974,L3465,u30,m2,EMIL,I was all of these.
975,L3464,u26,m2,CUTLER,...delusions and paranoia.
976,L3461,u26,m2,CUTLER,"Oh, sure."
977,L3460,u30,m2,EMIL,You bring the cigarettes?
978,L3459,u26,m2,CUTLER,"I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check."
979,L3396,u26,m2,CUTLER,I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
980,L3395,u30,m2,EMIL,"Yes.  Yes, come with me!"
981,L3394,u26,m2,CUTLER,I'm coming with you.
982,L3393,u30,m2,EMIL,Where are we going?
983,L3392,u26,m2,CUTLER,Don't say anything.
984,L3385,u30,m2,EMIL,He has the camera!  He took the movie!
985,L3384,u26,m2,CUTLER,Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
986,L3383,u30,m2,EMIL,Oh no!  No!  Shit!
987,L3382,u30,m2,EMIL,Here.  I have your money.
988,L3381,u26,m2,CUTLER,I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
989,L3380,u30,m2,EMIL,Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
990,L3517,u34,m2,JORDY,"Daphne, I..."
991,L3516,u27,m2,DAPHNE,I don't want to drag you down with me.
992,L3515,u34,m2,JORDY,...Do you really want me to forget about you?
993,L3514,u27,m2,DAPHNE,Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
994,L3330,u27,m2,DAPHNE,Pouring it out!
995,L3329,u34,m2,JORDY,What are you doing?
996,L3318,u27,m2,DAPHNE,I'll get my clothes.
997,L3317,u34,m2,JORDY,I'll make some for us.
998,L3316,u27,m2,DAPHNE,In the kitchen.
999,L3315,u34,m2,JORDY,Do you have coffee?
1000,L3314,u27,m2,DAPHNE,Right.
1001,L3313,u34,m2,JORDY,You better get packed.
1002,L3311,u34,m2,JORDY,I'm glad I met you.
1003,L3310,u27,m2,DAPHNE,No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
1004,L3309,u34,m2,JORDY,A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
1005,L3308,u27,m2,DAPHNE,"If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away."
1006,L3307,u34,m2,JORDY,"If I was your boyfriend, I might be."
1007,L3306,u27,m2,DAPHNE,Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
1008,L3305,u34,m2,JORDY,Is he your boyfriend?
1009,L3302,u27,m2,DAPHNE,I'm sorry.
1010,L3301,u34,m2,JORDY,I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
1011,L3300,u27,m2,DAPHNE,Are you alright?
1012,L3181,u27,m2,DAPHNE,I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
1013,L3180,u34,m2,JORDY,They're not gonna send you right back.
1014,L3179,u27,m2,DAPHNE,You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
1015,L3178,u34,m2,JORDY,I know.
1016,L3177,u27,m2,DAPHNE,I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
1017,L3170,u34,m2,JORDY,I'm just trying to find out who you are.
1018,L3169,u27,m2,DAPHNE,What are you asking me?
1019,L3168,u34,m2,JORDY,So you were never a prostitute?
1020,L3167,u27,m2,DAPHNE,"I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's."
1021,L3166,u27,m2,DAPHNE,No.
1022,L3165,u34,m2,JORDY,What about back home?
1023,L3164,u27,m2,DAPHNE,No.
1024,L3163,u34,m2,JORDY,Did you ever turn tricks before?
1025,L3162,u27,m2,DAPHNE,"Yes, I considered it."
1026,L3161,u34,m2,JORDY,You considered becoming a prostitute?
1027,L3160,u34,m2,JORDY,Yeah.  This way.
1028,L3159,u27,m2,DAPHNE,So...the station is empty?
1029,L3158,u34,m2,JORDY,The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
1030,L3097,u27,m2,DAPHNE,Somewhere else?
1031,L3096,u34,m2,JORDY,I can't take you to my place.
1032,L3095,u27,m2,DAPHNE,Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
1033,L3094,u34,m2,JORDY,Divorced.
1034,L3093,u27,m2,DAPHNE,Are you married?
1035,L3092,u34,m2,JORDY,They won't until this is over.
1036,L3091,u27,m2,DAPHNE,I will if they don't send me back.
1037,L3090,u34,m2,JORDY,If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
1038,L3089,u27,m2,DAPHNE,Now I become custody of police department?
1039,L3061,u27,m2,DAPHNE,"Yes, but he was a cop."
1040,L3060,u34,m2,JORDY,Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
1041,L3059,u27,m2,DAPHNE,...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
1042,L3065,u27,m2,DAPHNE,You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
1043,L3064,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?"
1044,L3063,u27,m2,DAPHNE,"I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled."
1045,L3062,u29,m2,EDDIE,A cop?
1046,L3056,u27,m2,DAPHNE,"No, no, don't talk to Immigration!"
1047,L3055,u29,m2,EDDIE,Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
1048,L3051,u29,m2,EDDIE,Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
1049,L3050,u27,m2,DAPHNE,"If I tell you, will you arrest me?"
1050,L3049,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you."
1051,L3048,u29,m2,EDDIE,Go on.
1052,L3047,u27,m2,DAPHNE,"Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs."
1053,L3046,u29,m2,EDDIE,"C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?"
1054,L3045,u27,m2,DAPHNE,"I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything."
1055,L3214,u28,m2,DUFFY,"Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference."
1056,L3213,u29,m2,EDDIE,I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
1057,L3212,u28,m2,DUFFY,Oh yeah...?  Alright.
1058,L3211,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours."
1059,L3210,u28,m2,DUFFY,"Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions."
1060,L3209,u29,m2,EDDIE,"It was my decision, not his."
1061,L3208,u28,m2,DUFFY,Oh.
1062,L3506,u28,m2,DUFFY,There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
1063,L3505,u34,m2,JORDY,But Chief?  Over this??
1064,L3504,u28,m2,DUFFY,"How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield."
1065,L3503,u34,m2,JORDY,End my career?
1066,L3502,u28,m2,DUFFY,Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
1067,L3501,u34,m2,JORDY,Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
1068,L3500,u28,m2,DUFFY,Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
1069,L3499,u34,m2,JORDY,What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
1070,L3498,u28,m2,DUFFY,The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
1071,L3294,u28,m2,DUFFY,Okay.  But not water sports.
1072,L3293,u34,m2,JORDY,Chief - mind if I take her?
1073,L3203,u28,m2,DUFFY,Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
1074,L3202,u34,m2,JORDY,No!  Nothing happened.
1075,L3201,u28,m2,DUFFY,"A shower!?  Did you take one, too?"
1076,L3200,u34,m2,JORDY,I let her take a shower.
1077,L3199,u28,m2,DUFFY,"What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'"
1078,L3198,u34,m2,JORDY,Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
1079,L3197,u28,m2,DUFFY,I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
1080,L3196,u34,m2,JORDY,"Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?"
1081,L2800,u34,m2,JORDY,"'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it."
1082,L2799,u28,m2,DUFFY,Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
1083,L2798,u34,m2,JORDY,"Who do you think, Chief?!"
1084,L2797,u28,m2,DUFFY,Who did cause and origin?
1085,L3292,u35,m2,KORFIN,Yeah.
1086,L3291,u28,m2,DUFFY,Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
1087,L3290,u35,m2,KORFIN,Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
1088,L3289,u28,m2,DUFFY,Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
1089,L2805,u28,m2,DUFFY,"You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does."
1090,L2804,u35,m2,KORFIN,"I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media."
1091,L2803,u28,m2,DUFFY,"What was that, Korfin?"
1092,L2802,u35,m2,KORFIN,"Yeah, right."
1093,L2801,u28,m2,DUFFY,Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
1094,L3028,u29,m2,EDDIE,"I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers."
1095,L3027,u36,m2,LEON,He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
1096,L3023,u36,m2,LEON,No.  I'm okay.
1097,L3022,u29,m2,EDDIE,Are you hit?
1098,L3017,u36,m2,LEON,Stay with her.
1099,L3016,u29,m2,EDDIE,The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
1100,L2938,u29,m2,EDDIE,C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
1101,L2937,u36,m2,LEON,Yeah.
1102,L2936,u29,m2,EDDIE,Only one guys checked in?
1103,L2925,u29,m2,EDDIE,It's okay.
1104,L2924,u36,m2,LEON,Sorry...PD only.
1105,L2923,u36,m2,LEON,Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
1106,L2922,u29,m2,EDDIE,Any I.D.?
1107,L2921,u36,m2,LEON,Takin' a bath.
1108,L2920,u29,m2,EDDIE,Where is she?
1109,L2752,u29,m2,EDDIE,A timer.
1110,L2751,u36,m2,LEON,What's he looking for?
1111,L2633,u36,m2,LEON,You ready?
1112,L2632,u29,m2,EDDIE,Tomorrow.  At lunch.
1113,L2631,u36,m2,LEON,When?
1114,L2630,u29,m2,EDDIE,I'm gonna propose.
1115,L2603,u29,m2,EDDIE,What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
1116,L2602,u36,m2,LEON,"It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid."
1117,L2601,u36,m2,LEON,Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
1118,L2600,u29,m2,EDDIE,Vodka tonic.
1119,L2599,u36,m2,LEON,"Coffee for me, I gotta slow down."
1120,L2990,u44,m2,ROSE,She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
1121,L2989,u29,m2,EDDIE,He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
1122,L2988,u44,m2,ROSE,"Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me."
1123,L2987,u29,m2,EDDIE,Describe him.
1124,L2986,u44,m2,ROSE,He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
1125,L2981,u44,m2,ROSE,"Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too."
1126,L2980,u29,m2,EDDIE,What are you saying?
1127,L2979,u44,m2,ROSE,"Boy, she's so popular all the sudden."
1128,L2978,u29,m2,EDDIE,Did you tell him you did?
1129,L2977,u44,m2,ROSE,No.
1130,L2976,u29,m2,EDDIE,Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
1131,L2975,u44,m2,ROSE,"Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl..."
1132,L2973,u44,m2,ROSE,Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
1133,L2972,u29,m2,EDDIE,"We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel."
1134,L2971,u44,m2,ROSE,What's wrong?
1135,L2967,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up."
1136,L2966,u44,m2,ROSE,I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
1137,L2965,u29,m2,EDDIE,Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
1138,L2964,u44,m2,ROSE,Who's there?
1139,L3230,u29,m2,EDDIE,"You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him."
1140,L3229,u34,m2,JORDY,Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
1141,L3228,u29,m2,EDDIE,"How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it."
1142,L3227,u34,m2,JORDY,"But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her."
1143,L3226,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional."
1144,L3225,u34,m2,JORDY,"I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent."
1145,L3224,u29,m2,EDDIE,"No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead."
1146,L3223,u34,m2,JORDY,"Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but..."
1147,L3222,u29,m2,EDDIE,Just a shower?
1148,L3221,u34,m2,JORDY,I took her there for a shower and that's it.
1149,L3220,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me."
1150,L3219,u34,m2,JORDY,"Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her."
1151,L3082,u29,m2,EDDIE,Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
1152,L3081,u34,m2,JORDY,Hey.  I'm a professional.
1153,L3080,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left."
1154,L3079,u34,m2,JORDY,You know what I'm saying here.
1155,L3078,u29,m2,EDDIE,You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
1156,L3077,u34,m2,JORDY,C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
1157,L3076,u29,m2,EDDIE,So am I.
1158,L3075,u34,m2,JORDY,I'm serious here.
1159,L3074,u29,m2,EDDIE,My point exactly.
1160,L3073,u34,m2,JORDY,I don't have a girlfriend.
1161,L3072,u29,m2,EDDIE,What would your girlfriend think of that?
1162,L3071,u34,m2,JORDY,Yeah.
1163,L3070,u29,m2,EDDIE,You wanna talk to her alone?
1164,L3069,u34,m2,JORDY,"Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her."
1165,L3068,u34,m2,JORDY,Raw deal.
1166,L3067,u29,m2,EDDIE,She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
1167,L3058,u29,m2,EDDIE,Something back home?
1168,L3057,u34,m2,JORDY,Why not?
1169,L3054,u29,m2,EDDIE,Is that all there is?
1170,L3053,u34,m2,JORDY,She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
1171,L3052,u29,m2,EDDIE,What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
1172,L2999,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first."
1173,L2998,u34,m2,JORDY,"I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid."
1174,L2997,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?"
1175,L2996,u34,m2,JORDY,Of course.
1176,L2995,u29,m2,EDDIE,"So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back."
1177,L2994,u34,m2,JORDY,I'm on duty.
1178,L2993,u29,m2,EDDIE,You thirsty?
1179,L2992,u34,m2,JORDY,I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
1180,L2991,u29,m2,EDDIE,Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
1181,L2963,u29,m2,EDDIE,Better than one.
1182,L2962,u34,m2,JORDY,Two heads.
1183,L2958,u34,m2,JORDY,I'll call it... tails.
1184,L2957,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come."
1185,L2956,u34,m2,JORDY,This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
1186,L2955,u29,m2,EDDIE,I'll let you know what happens.
1187,L2953,u34,m2,JORDY,But what if it does?  You might need my help.
1188,L2952,u29,m2,EDDIE,This has nothing to do with your fire.
1189,L2951,u34,m2,JORDY,Mind if I ride along with you?
1190,L2950,u29,m2,EDDIE,You got any better ideas?
1191,L2949,u34,m2,JORDY,You goin' to the escort service?
1192,L2906,u29,m2,EDDIE,Stay here.
1193,L2905,u34,m2,JORDY,My folks are.
1194,L2904,u29,m2,EDDIE,You're Polish?
1195,L2903,u34,m2,JORDY,My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
1196,L2902,u29,m2,EDDIE,This isn't homicide school.
1197,L2901,u34,m2,JORDY,"I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something."
1198,L2900,u29,m2,EDDIE,There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
1199,L2899,u34,m2,JORDY,I'll come with you.
1200,L2897,u34,m2,JORDY,Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
1201,L2896,u29,m2,EDDIE,Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
1202,L2895,u34,m2,JORDY,"Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell."
1203,L2893,u34,m2,JORDY,"Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?"
1204,L2892,u29,m2,EDDIE,What would you call her?
1205,L2891,u34,m2,JORDY,Who says she's a suspect?
1206,L2890,u29,m2,EDDIE,Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
1207,L2889,u34,m2,JORDY,Hmmmm.
1208,L2888,u29,m2,EDDIE,Pretty.
1209,L2887,u34,m2,JORDY,The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
1210,L2886,u29,m2,EDDIE,"You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal."
1211,L2885,u34,m2,JORDY,"If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?"
1212,L2884,u29,m2,EDDIE,Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
1213,L2883,u34,m2,JORDY,Did you get a report from the M.E.?
1214,L2882,u29,m2,EDDIE,Good.  Good.  Commendable.
1215,L2881,u34,m2,JORDY,I don't even watch TV.
1216,L2880,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Nah, why should you?"
1217,L2879,u34,m2,JORDY,"Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff."
1218,L2878,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit."
1219,L2877,u34,m2,JORDY,"Nah, I musta missed it."
1220,L2876,u29,m2,EDDIE,Watch the news?
1221,L2875,u34,m2,JORDY,It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
1222,L2748,u34,m2,JORDY,"Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?"
1223,L2747,u29,m2,EDDIE,"No, what is it?"
1224,L2746,u34,m2,JORDY,"You know what that is, right?"
1225,L2731,u29,m2,EDDIE,"No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?"
1226,L2730,u34,m2,JORDY,"Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do."
1227,L3249,u30,m2,EMIL,"Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?"
1228,L3248,u29,m2,EDDIE,You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
1229,L3244,u29,m2,EDDIE,If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
1230,L3243,u30,m2,EMIL,So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
1231,L3242,u30,m2,EMIL,Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
1232,L3241,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Then do it, asshole."
1233,L3240,u30,m2,EMIL,I kill someone famous.
1234,L3239,u29,m2,EDDIE,What's your accomplishment.
1235,L3238,u30,m2,EMIL,"Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books."
1236,L3237,u29,m2,EDDIE,What do you want?
1237,L3236,u30,m2,EMIL,So...who's Nicky?
1238,L3157,u29,m2,EDDIE,Don't be late.
1239,L3156,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Thank you.
1240,L3155,u29,m2,EDDIE,See you later.  Good luck.
1241,L3154,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Okay.
1242,L3153,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Yeah, yeah.  Good thing."
1243,L3152,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing."
1244,L3151,u29,m2,EDDIE,Yeah.  I promise.
1245,L3150,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,You promise?
1246,L3149,u29,m2,EDDIE,Tonight.
1247,L3148,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Okay, til tonight."
1248,L3147,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,I love you.
1249,L3146,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Patronizing you... Nay, I love you."
1250,L3145,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
1251,L3144,u29,m2,EDDIE,"I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me."
1252,L3143,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Promise?
1253,L3142,u29,m2,EDDIE,I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
1254,L3141,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and..."
1255,L3140,u29,m2,EDDIE,No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
1256,L3139,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here."
1257,L3138,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Well, that's great."
1258,L3137,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Yeah.
1259,L3136,u29,m2,EDDIE,That's good.
1260,L3135,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!"
1261,L3130,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
1262,L3129,u29,m2,EDDIE,Answer it.
1263,L3128,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,No.  Tell me what you want to say.
1264,L3127,u29,m2,EDDIE,Answer the phone.
1265,L3126,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
1266,L3121,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
1267,L3120,u29,m2,EDDIE,Could be Leon's.
1268,L3119,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
1269,L3117,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,You're not so bad yourself.
1270,L3116,u29,m2,EDDIE,You're ruthless.
1271,L3115,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?"
1272,L3114,u29,m2,EDDIE,You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
1273,L3113,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
1274,L3112,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was..."
1275,L3111,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
1276,L3110,u29,m2,EDDIE,I'm not.
1277,L3109,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me."
1278,L3108,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?"
1279,L3107,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Stop it.
1280,L3106,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh..."
1281,L3105,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
1282,L3104,u29,m2,EDDIE,I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
1283,L3103,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
1284,L3102,u29,m2,EDDIE,Hey.
1285,L3101,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Hey, honey."
1286,L3044,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Okay.
1287,L3043,u29,m2,EDDIE,Alright.
1288,L3042,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Alright.
1289,L3041,u29,m2,EDDIE,Alright?
1290,L3040,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Alright.
1291,L3039,u29,m2,EDDIE,Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
1292,L3038,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Eddie, are you okay?"
1293,L3037,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Alright, cut, cut, cut."
1294,L3036,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously."
1295,L3035,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Do you have the suspect in custody?
1296,L3034,u29,m2,EDDIE,"He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine."
1297,L3033,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?"
1298,L3032,u29,m2,EDDIE,I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
1299,L3031,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?"
1300,L3030,u29,m2,EDDIE,I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
1301,L3029,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
1302,L2765,u29,m2,EDDIE,We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
1303,L2764,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Is it drug related?
1304,L2763,u29,m2,EDDIE,You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
1305,L2762,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Can we go up to the crime scene?
1306,L2761,u29,m2,EDDIE,There are two bodies found at this point.
1307,L2760,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,How many victims are up there?
1308,L2759,u29,m2,EDDIE,We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
1309,L2758,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,"Detective, does it look like a murder?"
1310,L2665,u29,m2,EDDIE,Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
1311,L2664,u31,m2,HAWKINS,Any chance we can do that again?
1312,L2656,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Yeah, yeah.  Jesus."
1313,L2655,u31,m2,HAWKINS,Okay.  You ready?
1314,L2654,u29,m2,EDDIE,Keep them out of my way.
1315,L2653,u31,m2,HAWKINS,Ready?
1316,L2652,u31,m2,HAWKINS,You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
1317,L2651,u29,m2,EDDIE,I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
1318,L2648,u29,m2,EDDIE,Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
1319,L2647,u31,m2,HAWKINS,That's unique.
1320,L2646,u29,m2,EDDIE,He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
1321,L2645,u29,m2,EDDIE,Not what.  Who.
1322,L2644,u31,m2,HAWKINS,So what's unique?
1323,L2612,u31,m2,HAWKINS,"My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?"
1324,L2611,u29,m2,EDDIE,How old are your kids?
1325,L2607,u29,m2,EDDIE,I'm not moody.
1326,L2606,u31,m2,HAWKINS,"I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie."
1327,L2605,u29,m2,EDDIE,"Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore."
1328,L2604,u31,m2,HAWKINS,Sooner or later that's everybody.
1329,L2596,u31,m2,HAWKINS,Jesus Christ.
1330,L2595,u29,m2,EDDIE,"So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off."
1331,L2628,u30,m2,EMIL,No.  Are you proposing?
1332,L2627,u45,m2,SECONDARY OFFICER,Are you married?
1333,L2626,u30,m2,EMIL,Dog food.
1334,L2625,u45,m2,SECONDARY OFFICER,And what do you do with the bones?
1335,L2624,u30,m2,EMIL,You stuff sausage in it.
1336,L2623,u45,m2,SECONDARY OFFICER,You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
1337,L2622,u30,m2,EMIL,I am butcher.
1338,L2621,u45,m2,SECONDARY OFFICER,Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
1339,L3286,u30,m2,EMIL,Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
1340,L3285,u31,m2,HAWKINS,Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
1341,L3284,u30,m2,EMIL,If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
1342,L3283,u31,m2,HAWKINS,What?  It doesn't work that way.
1343,L3282,u30,m2,EMIL,We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
1344,L3281,u31,m2,HAWKINS,I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
1345,L3280,u30,m2,EMIL,No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
1346,L3279,u31,m2,HAWKINS,Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
1347,L3278,u30,m2,EMIL,Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
1348,L3556,u30,m2,EMIL,If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
1349,L3555,u34,m2,JORDY,Let her go!  Let her go!!
1350,L3554,u30,m2,EMIL,Tell him to put his gun down!
1351,L3436,u30,m2,EMIL,The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
1352,L3435,u34,m2,JORDY,Where's your partner?
1353,L3434,u34,m2,JORDY,Get down on your knees.
1354,L3433,u30,m2,EMIL,"C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls."
1355,L3432,u34,m2,JORDY,You'll be my first.
1356,L3431,u30,m2,EMIL,You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
1357,L3421,u34,m2,JORDY,"Tommy, take a walk."
1358,L3420,u30,m2,EMIL,My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
1359,L3419,u34,m2,JORDY,Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
1360,L2858,u32,m2,HONEY,"Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!"
1361,L2857,u30,m2,EMIL,Give me the address!!
1362,L2856,u32,m2,HONEY,"Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time."
1363,L2855,u30,m2,EMIL,Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
1364,L2854,u32,m2,HONEY,"Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?"
1365,L2853,u30,m2,EMIL,I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
1366,L2852,u32,m2,HONEY,That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
1367,L2851,u30,m2,EMIL,Where is escort service?
1368,L2850,u32,m2,HONEY,It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
1369,L2849,u30,m2,EMIL,"I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?"
1370,L2848,u32,m2,HONEY,Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
1371,L2847,u32,m2,HONEY,"Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl."
1372,L2846,u30,m2,EMIL,Where's Czech girl?
1373,L2845,u32,m2,HONEY,"Hi, I'm Honey."
1374,L2581,u30,m2,EMIL,He doesn't speak English.
1375,L2580,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,"I'd like to speak for himself, okay?"
1376,L2579,u30,m2,EMIL,Two weeks.
1377,L2578,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,How long are you planning to stay?
1378,L2577,u30,m2,EMIL,We are both from Prague.
1379,L2574,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,"No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?"
1380,L2573,u30,m2,EMIL,Is there a problem?
1381,L2572,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,Please join us.  Come on forward.
1382,L2571,u30,m2,EMIL,Yes.
1383,L2570,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
1384,L2569,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,"Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!"
1385,L2568,u30,m2,EMIL,I have five-hundred dollars.
1386,L2567,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,How much money are you carrying with you?
1387,L2566,u30,m2,EMIL,Two weeks holiday.
1388,L2565,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
1389,L2564,u30,m2,EMIL,Yes sir.
1390,L2563,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,"Next.  Could I see your documents, please?"
1391,L2915,u30,m2,EMIL,Yes.  Both.
1392,L2914,u48,m2,VENDOR,"Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?"
1393,L2913,u30,m2,EMIL,Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
1394,L2912,u48,m2,VENDOR,"In here, says he wants a million."
1395,L2911,u30,m2,EMIL,Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
1396,L2910,u48,m2,VENDOR,This all you want?
1397,L2909,u48,m2,VENDOR,New York's finest.  This is his case.
1398,L2908,u30,m2,EMIL,Who is he?
1399,L3548,u42,m2,OLEG,No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
1400,L3547,u30,m2,EMIL,Traitor!!
1401,L3378,u30,m2,EMIL,"You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you."
1402,L3377,u42,m2,OLEG,"No, I don't get that!"
1403,L3376,u30,m2,EMIL,You got that?
1404,L3375,u30,m2,EMIL,Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
1405,L3374,u42,m2,OLEG,Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
1406,L3373,u30,m2,EMIL,Credit?
1407,L3372,u42,m2,OLEG,I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
1408,L3370,u30,m2,EMIL,Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
1409,L3369,u42,m2,OLEG,"Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now."
1410,L3368,u30,m2,EMIL,Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
1411,L3366,u42,m2,OLEG,Be quiet.  Watch.
1412,L3365,u30,m2,EMIL,I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
1413,L3364,u30,m2,EMIL,Bad last moment - I cut it out.
1414,L3363,u42,m2,OLEG,This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
1415,L3362,u30,m2,EMIL,Shut up.  Look!
1416,L3361,u42,m2,OLEG,I'm serious.
1417,L3360,u30,m2,EMIL,The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
1418,L3359,u42,m2,OLEG,"In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?"
1419,L3357,u30,m2,EMIL,"Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!"
1420,L3356,u42,m2,OLEG,You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
1421,L3251,u42,m2,OLEG,Cut!
1422,L3250,u30,m2,EMIL,Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
1423,L3247,u42,m2,OLEG,Good idea!
1424,L3246,u30,m2,EMIL,"No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!"
1425,L3193,u42,m2,OLEG,This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
1426,L3192,u30,m2,EMIL,Sit down!
1427,L3191,u42,m2,OLEG,Let me get a shot of it.
1428,L3190,u30,m2,EMIL,What does it look like?  It's an address book!
1429,L3189,u42,m2,OLEG,What is that?
1430,L3188,u30,m2,EMIL,"Put the camera down, Oleg."
1431,L3187,u42,m2,OLEG,Why not?
1432,L3186,u30,m2,EMIL,"And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry."
1433,L3185,u42,m2,OLEG,I did.
1434,L3184,u30,m2,EMIL,The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
1435,L3183,u42,m2,OLEG,What is it?
1436,L3088,u30,m2,EMIL,Don't want to film this?
1437,L3087,u42,m2,OLEG,"Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!"
1438,L3085,u42,m2,OLEG,Does it hurt?
1439,L3084,u30,m2,EMIL,Shut up.
1440,L3083,u42,m2,OLEG,Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
1441,L2844,u30,m2,EMIL,"Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!"
1442,L2843,u42,m2,OLEG,"Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?"
1443,L2842,u30,m2,EMIL,Get in the bathroom!
1444,L2790,u30,m2,EMIL,I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
1445,L2789,u42,m2,OLEG,Whore?
1446,L2783,u42,m2,OLEG,I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
1447,L2782,u30,m2,EMIL,How you erase this?
1448,L2781,u42,m2,OLEG,You said speak Czech!
1449,L2780,u30,m2,EMIL,Speak English!
1450,L2779,u42,m2,OLEG,I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
1451,L2778,u30,m2,EMIL,Turn that fucking thing off!
1452,L2671,u30,m2,EMIL,Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
1453,L2670,u42,m2,OLEG,What?
1454,L2668,u30,m2,EMIL,"For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg."
1455,L2667,u42,m2,OLEG,Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
1456,L2666,u30,m2,EMIL,Turn that off!  Get the bags.
1457,L2640,u30,m2,EMIL,We have no money.  Come on.
1458,L2639,u42,m2,OLEG,Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
1459,L2638,u30,m2,EMIL,Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
1460,L2637,u42,m2,OLEG,Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
1461,L2636,u30,m2,EMIL,Don't speak Russian!
1462,L2635,u42,m2,OLEG,Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
1463,L2562,u42,m2,OLEG,I want to document my trip to America.
1464,L2561,u30,m2,EMIL,Did you hear what I said?
1465,L2560,u42,m2,OLEG,Okay.
1466,L2559,u30,m2,EMIL,Don't fool around.
1467,L2558,u42,m2,OLEG,Okay.
1468,L2557,u30,m2,EMIL,Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
1469,L2692,u30,m2,EMIL,You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
1470,L2691,u39,m2,MILOS,"We started over, you can too."
1471,L2690,u30,m2,EMIL,A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
1472,L2689,u39,m2,MILOS,It's easy to learn.
1473,L2688,u30,m2,EMIL,As a plumber?!
1474,L2687,u39,m2,MILOS,"Yes, the money is good."
1475,L2686,u30,m2,EMIL,A job?
1476,L2685,u39,m2,MILOS,I can get you a job.
1477,L2682,u39,m2,MILOS,Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
1478,L2681,u30,m2,EMIL,Ha. Ha.
1479,L2680,u39,m2,MILOS,We spent it!
1480,L2679,u30,m2,EMIL,Milos.  Get my money!
1481,L2678,u39,m2,MILOS,"Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!"
1482,L2676,u30,m2,EMIL,You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
1483,L2675,u39,m2,MILOS,Did you hurt her?
1484,L2674,u30,m2,EMIL,Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
1485,L2673,u30,m2,EMIL,Surprise!  Surprise!
1486,L2672,u39,m2,MILOS,Emil???!
1487,L3353,u37,m2,MAGGIE,You want the tape?  There it is!
1488,L3352,u31,m2,HAWKINS,Viewer discretion advised!
1489,L3275,u37,m2,MAGGIE,"Trust me, you'll want to take this call."
1490,L3274,u31,m2,HAWKINS,"I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey."
1491,L3273,u37,m2,MAGGIE,You've got a call.
1492,L3272,u31,m2,HAWKINS,What are you doing here?
1493,L3271,u37,m2,MAGGIE,Robert...?
1494,L3413,u36,m2,LEON,Don't give me that fucking shit.
1495,L3412,u31,m2,HAWKINS,If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
1496,L3411,u36,m2,LEON,You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
1497,L3410,u31,m2,HAWKINS,"This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him."
1498,L3409,u36,m2,LEON,"And you, you'll pay for what you did!"
1499,L2615,u31,m2,HAWKINS,"Paulie, you've got kids, right?"
1500,L2614,u36,m2,LEON,Yeah?
1501,L2610,u31,m2,HAWKINS,In love?  With who?
1502,L2609,u36,m2,LEON,Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
1503,L2608,u31,m2,HAWKINS,Isn't he a little moody?
1504,L3269,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
1505,L3268,u31,m2,HAWKINS,That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
1506,L3267,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,Alright.  Go ahead.
1507,L3266,u31,m2,HAWKINS,I'm trying to tell you.
1508,L3265,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,I want to hear everything he said.
1509,L3264,u31,m2,HAWKINS,"Well, he..."
1510,L3263,u41,m2,NICOLETTE,What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
1511,L3262,u31,m2,HAWKINS,I know.
1512,L2591,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,Excuse me?
1513,L2590,u42,m2,OLEG,"Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called ""It's a Wonderful Life"" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white."
1514,L2589,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
1515,L2588,u42,m2,OLEG,I'm here for movies.
1516,L2587,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,What are you coming here to do?
1517,L2586,u42,m2,OLEG,A cheap hotel.
1518,L2585,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,"Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?"
1519,L2584,u42,m2,OLEG,New York.
1520,L2583,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
1521,L2582,u42,m2,OLEG,I speak English.
1522,L2576,u33,m2,IMMIGRATION OFFICER,Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
1523,L2575,u42,m2,OLEG,Yes...he's my friend.
1524,L3403,u34,m2,JORDY,"He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in."
1525,L3402,u36,m2,LEON,"Well, he killed my partner!"
1526,L3401,u34,m2,JORDY,He's my collar!
1527,L3400,u36,m2,LEON,We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
1528,L3399,u34,m2,JORDY,No way!  He's mine!
1529,L3398,u36,m2,LEON,I'll take him.
1530,L2745,u34,m2,JORDY,Evidence.  Of a homicide.
1531,L2744,u36,m2,LEON,What was that?
1532,L2743,u36,m2,LEON,"Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight."
1533,L2742,u34,m2,JORDY,"And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them."
1534,L2741,u36,m2,LEON,That's what it looks like to me.
1535,L2740,u34,m2,JORDY,"So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?"
1536,L2733,u34,m2,JORDY,Thanks.  Appreciate it.
1537,L2732,u36,m2,LEON,No.  Go ahead.
1538,L2773,u34,m2,JORDY,Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
1539,L2772,u40,m2,MUGGER,A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
1540,L2771,u34,m2,JORDY,You okay?
1541,L2707,u40,m2,MUGGER,"Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!"
1542,L2706,u34,m2,JORDY,I'll send a cop back for you.
1543,L2703,u34,m2,JORDY,Oh yeah?  Guess again.
1544,L2702,u40,m2,MUGGER,Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
1545,L2701,u34,m2,JORDY,"Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?"
1546,L2700,u40,m2,MUGGER,"Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?"
1547,L2699,u34,m2,JORDY,"Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!"
1548,L2698,u40,m2,MUGGER,Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
1549,L2813,u38,m2,MAX,"Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you."
1550,L2812,u34,m2,JORDY,Yeah?  What kind?
1551,L2811,u38,m2,MAX,I used an accelerant.
1552,L2810,u34,m2,JORDY,How did you start the fire this time?
1553,L2809,u38,m2,MAX,"Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?"
1554,L2808,u34,m2,JORDY,"What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter."
1555,L3344,u34,m2,JORDY,They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
1556,L3343,u35,m2,KORFIN,What the hell happened?
1557,L3342,u34,m2,JORDY,Get outta here!
1558,L3288,u34,m2,JORDY,Not good.
1559,L3287,u35,m2,KORFIN,How was it?
1560,L3026,u34,m2,JORDY,"Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby."
1561,L3025,u35,m2,KORFIN,"It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!"
1562,L3024,u34,m2,JORDY,"Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!"
1563,L2872,u34,m2,JORDY,If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
1564,L2871,u35,m2,KORFIN,Aren't you tired?
1565,L2870,u34,m2,JORDY,You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
1566,L2865,u35,m2,KORFIN,"You hear that question, Garcia?"
1567,L2864,u34,m2,JORDY,How long they been livin' here?
1568,L2863,u35,m2,KORFIN,"-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is."
1569,L2795,u34,m2,JORDY,Maybe you can be his stand-in.
1570,L2794,u35,m2,KORFIN,Yeah?
1571,L2793,u34,m2,JORDY,"Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him."
1572,L2768,u34,m2,JORDY,There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
1573,L2767,u35,m2,KORFIN,What?
1574,L2757,u34,m2,JORDY,That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
1575,L2756,u35,m2,KORFIN,What??
1576,L2755,u34,m2,JORDY,He knew all along.
1577,L2754,u35,m2,KORFIN,You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
1578,L2739,u35,m2,KORFIN,"But you knew that, right?"
1579,L2738,u34,m2,JORDY,The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
1580,L2737,u34,m2,JORDY,Don't blow your nose!
1581,L2736,u35,m2,KORFIN,Clean?
1582,L2735,u34,m2,JORDY,"Mouth's clean, too."
1583,L2725,u34,m2,JORDY,Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
1584,L2724,u35,m2,KORFIN,"Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie."
1585,L2721,u35,m2,KORFIN,'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
1586,L2720,u34,m2,JORDY,"Oh yeah, why?"
1587,L2719,u35,m2,KORFIN,Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
1588,L2718,u34,m2,JORDY,You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
1589,L2717,u35,m2,KORFIN,"I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?"
1590,L2716,u34,m2,JORDY,I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
1591,L2715,u35,m2,KORFIN,"Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!"
1592,L3427,u34,m2,JORDY,"GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!"
1593,L3426,u47,m2,TOMMY,"Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood."
1594,L3425,u34,m2,JORDY,"Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy."
1595,L3424,u47,m2,TOMMY,Don't stoop to his level!
1596,L3423,u34,m2,JORDY,Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
1597,L3422,u47,m2,TOMMY,What are you gonna do?
1598,L2930,u47,m2,TOMMY,The clerk?
1599,L2929,u34,m2,JORDY,Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
1600,L2928,u47,m2,TOMMY,Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
1601,L2840,u46,m2,STEPHEN GELLER,That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
1602,L2839,u43,m2,ROBERT HAWKINS,But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
1603,L2838,u46,m2,STEPHEN GELLER,"We're in negotiations, that's correct."
1604,L2837,u43,m2,ROBERT HAWKINS,And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
1605,L2836,u46,m2,STEPHEN GELLER,"Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?"
1606,L2835,u43,m2,ROBERT HAWKINS,"Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?"
1607,L2834,u46,m2,STEPHEN GELLER,"Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted."
1608,L2833,u43,m2,ROBERT HAWKINS,You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
1609,L2832,u46,m2,STEPHEN GELLER,"It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor."
1610,L2831,u43,m2,ROBERT HAWKINS,...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
1611,L2830,u46,m2,STEPHEN GELLER,Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
1612,L2829,u43,m2,ROBERT HAWKINS,Your doctor?
1613,L2828,u46,m2,STEPHEN GELLER,"This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor."
1614,L3778,u55,m3,FLOYD,We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
1615,L3777,u49,m3,B20,CONTINUED
1616,L3771,u55,m3,FLOYD,"I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this."
1617,L3770,u49,m3,B20,CONTINUED
1618,L3757,u55,m3,FLOYD,How did they manage to do that without any communication?
1619,L3756,u49,m3,B20,CONTINUED
1620,L3750,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment."
1621,L3749,u49,m3,B20,CONTINUED
1622,L3729,u55,m3,FLOYD,She's wonderful.
1623,L3728,u49,m3,B20,CONTINUED
1624,L3721,u55,m3,FLOYD,"I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to."

1626,L3713,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful."

1628,L4300,u50,m3,BOWMAN,Roger.
1629,L4299,u60,m3,POOLE,I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
1630,L4298,u50,m3,BOWMAN,I guess not.
1631,L4297,u60,m3,POOLE,"I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy."
1632,L4296,u50,m3,BOWMAN,I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
1633,L4283,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it."
1634,L4282,u60,m3,POOLE,It's the last one.
1635,L4209,u50,m3,BOWMAN,Yes.
1636,L4208,u60,m3,POOLE,Hal?
1637,L4199,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business."
1638,L4198,u60,m3,POOLE,Two more.
1639,L4197,u50,m3,BOWMAN,Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
1640,L4196,u60,m3,POOLE,I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
1641,L4193,u60,m3,POOLE,No.
1642,L4192,u50,m3,BOWMAN,You're kidding.
1643,L4191,u60,m3,POOLE,Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
1644,L4190,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?"
1645,L4189,u60,m3,POOLE,Are you reasonably awake?
1646,L4188,u50,m3,BOWMAN,Good morning. How's it going?
1647,L4163,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry."
1648,L4162,u60,m3,POOLE,"Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low."
1649,L4161,u50,m3,BOWMAN,I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
1650,L4160,u60,m3,POOLE,"Yes, I don't know what to make of it."
1651,L4159,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Well, that's something."
1652,L4017,u60,m3,POOLE,"Still, all we have to do is ask Hal."
1653,L4016,u50,m3,BOWMAN,I guess it isn't.
1654,L4015,u60,m3,POOLE,I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
1655,L4014,u50,m3,BOWMAN,But not completely inconceivable?
1656,L4013,u60,m3,POOLE,I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
1657,L4012,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us."
1658,L4011,u60,m3,POOLE,"Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training."
1659,L4001,u60,m3,POOLE,That's true.
1660,L4000,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal."
1661,L3999,u60,m3,POOLE,How?
1662,L3998,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now."
1663,L3997,u60,m3,POOLE,"Yes, I thought so."
1664,L3996,u50,m3,BOWMAN,That seems very unlikely.
1665,L3995,u60,m3,POOLE,I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
1666,L3992,u60,m3,POOLE,"Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard."
1667,L3991,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"No, as a matter of fact, I didn't."
1668,L3990,u60,m3,POOLE,Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
1669,L3989,u50,m3,BOWMAN,Oh?
1670,L3988,u60,m3,POOLE,"I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation."
1671,L3987,u50,m3,BOWMAN,I suppose the idea was specialized training.
1672,L3984,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"No. I never did, either."
1673,L3983,u60,m3,POOLE,"I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training."
1674,L3982,u50,m3,BOWMAN,I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
1675,L3981,u60,m3,POOLE,"Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?"
1676,L3980,u50,m3,BOWMAN,It's possible.
1677,L3979,u60,m3,POOLE,"Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices."
1678,L3976,u60,m3,POOLE,"Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either."
1679,L3975,u50,m3,BOWMAN,Yes.
1680,L3974,u60,m3,POOLE,Really.
1681,L3973,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem."
1682,L3972,u60,m3,POOLE,"That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18."
1683,L3969,u60,m3,POOLE,Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
1684,L3968,u50,m3,BOWMAN,Yes?
1685,L3967,u60,m3,POOLE,It's about my salary cheques.
1686,L3966,u50,m3,BOWMAN,What's up?
1687,L3965,u60,m3,POOLE,"Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying."
1688,L3964,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Sure, what is it?"
1689,L3963,u60,m3,POOLE,"Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something."
1690,L3945,u60,m3,POOLE,"Okay, come on down."
1691,L3944,u50,m3,BOWMAN,Okay.
1692,L3943,u60,m3,POOLE,Right. Just a sec.
1693,L3942,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Hi. Frank... coming in, please."
1694,L4368,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection."
1695,L4367,u56,m3,HAL,"I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission."
1696,L4366,u50,m3,BOWMAN,I am prepared to do that anyway.
1697,L4363,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you."
1698,L4362,u56,m3,HAL,"I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it."
1699,L4361,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control."
1700,L4360,u56,m3,HAL,"I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest."
1701,L4357,u56,m3,HAL,"I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation."
1702,L4356,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Hal, switch to manual hibernation control."
1703,L4355,u56,m3,HAL,"Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me."
1704,L4354,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please."
1705,L4353,u56,m3,HAL,"If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble."
1706,L4350,u56,m3,HAL,"I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements."
1707,L4349,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please."
1708,L4348,u56,m3,HAL,Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
1709,L4347,u50,m3,BOWMAN,The antenna has to be replaced.
1710,L4346,u56,m3,HAL,"I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months."
1711,L4335,u56,m3,HAL,I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
1712,L4334,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Yes, it is."
1713,L4333,u56,m3,HAL,"Too bad about Frank, isn't it?"
1714,L4271,u56,m3,HAL,"Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission."
1715,L4270,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Yes, it is, Hal."
1716,L4269,u56,m3,HAL,Is your confidence in me fully restored?
1717,L4268,u50,m3,BOWMAN,And don't you worry about it.
1718,L4267,u56,m3,HAL,"Well, don't worry about it."
1719,L4266,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal."
1720,L4265,u56,m3,HAL,"Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history."
1721,L4230,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on."
1722,L4229,u56,m3,HAL,"Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear."
1723,L4228,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?"
1724,L4227,u56,m3,HAL,"I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong."
1725,L4224,u56,m3,HAL,"Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail."
1726,L4223,u50,m3,BOWMAN,You probably also know that we found them okay.
1727,L4222,u56,m3,HAL,"Yes, I know."
1728,L4221,u50,m3,BOWMAN,You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
1729,L4220,u56,m3,HAL,"Sure, Dave, what's up?"
1730,L4219,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something."
1731,L4080,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy."
1732,L4079,u56,m3,HAL,"The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours."
1733,L4070,u56,m3,HAL,MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
1734,L4069,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"What is it, Hal?"
1735,L4068,u56,m3,HAL,"Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem."
1736,L4007,u50,m3,BOWMAN,He's got a point.
1737,L4006,u56,m3,HAL,"I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know."
1738,L4019,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?"
1739,L4018,u51,m3,C12,CONTINUED
1740,L4010,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Still, you really don't believe it, do you?"

1742,L4003,u50,m3,BOWMAN,"Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?"

1757,L3684,u52,m3,CHILD,How many days until you come home?
1758,L3683,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called."
1759,L3682,u52,m3,CHILD,She's in the bathroom.
1760,L3681,u55,m3,FLOYD,Where is Mrs. Brown?
1761,L3680,u52,m3,CHILD,Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.

1764,L3676,u52,m3,CHILD,When are you coming home?

1771,L3810,u59,m3,PILOT,I'll bet it's a fortune.
1772,L3809,u53,m3,CO-PILOT,"I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty."
1773,L3808,u59,m3,PILOT,"Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week."
1774,L3807,u53,m3,CO-PILOT,Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
1775,L3806,u59,m3,PILOT,I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
1776,L3805,u53,m3,CO-PILOT,"Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic."
1777,L3799,u59,m3,PILOT,"Well, how's it going back there?"
1778,L3798,u53,m3,CO-PILOT,Thank you.
1779,L3797,u59,m3,PILOT,"Oh, thank you very much."
1780,L3780,u55,m3,FLOYD,Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
1781,L3779,u54,m3,ELENA,"Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you."
1782,L3776,u54,m3,ELENA,"Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June."
1783,L3775,u55,m3,FLOYD,"No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going."
1784,L3774,u54,m3,ELENA,Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
1785,L3759,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Well, that does sound very odd."
1786,L3758,u54,m3,ELENA,Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
1787,L3735,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Well, where are all of you off to?"
1788,L3734,u54,m3,ELENA,He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.

1790,L3732,u54,m3,ELENA,"Oh, that's such a delightful age."
1791,L3731,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow."
1792,L3730,u54,m3,ELENA,And your charming little daughter?
1793,L3653,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Yes, it's coming along very well."
1794,L3652,u58,m3,MILLER,I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
1795,L3651,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Yes, I think so. Just about then."
1796,L3631,u55,m3,FLOYD,Fine.
1797,L3630,u58,m3,MILLER,"Well, shall we go through Documentation?"
1798,L3629,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Yes, very pleasant."
1799,L3628,u58,m3,MILLER,Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
1800,L3627,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Please, it really doesn't matter."
1801,L3626,u58,m3,MILLER,"Well, thank you very much for being so understanding."
1802,L3623,u58,m3,MILLER,"I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang."
1803,L3622,u55,m3,FLOYD,"How do you do, Mr. Miller?"
1804,L3773,u55,m3,FLOYD,Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
1805,L3772,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,"This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts."
1806,L3768,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,"Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?"
1807,L3767,u55,m3,FLOYD,Certainly.
1808,L3766,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,"Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?"
1809,L3763,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Well, I'm glad about that."
1810,L3762,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,"Fortunately, they did."
1811,L3761,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely."
1812,L3760,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,"Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention."
1813,L3754,u55,m3,FLOYD,I see.
1814,L3753,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,That's right.
1815,L3752,u55,m3,FLOYD,You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
1816,L3751,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,"Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days."
1817,L3748,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,"Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order."
1818,L3747,u55,m3,FLOYD,Really?
1819,L3746,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,"Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius."
1820,L3745,u55,m3,FLOYD,"I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean."
1821,L3740,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Yes,as a matter of fact, I am."
1822,L3739,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,"Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?"
1823,L3738,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon"
1824,L3726,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Yes, really, thank you very much."
1825,L3725,u61,m3,SMYSLOV,Are you quite sure?
1826,L3724,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off."
1827,L3907,u57,m3,MICHAELS,"I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?"
1828,L3906,u55,m3,FLOYD,Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
1829,L3905,u57,m3,MICHAELS,"Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?"
1830,L3904,u55,m3,FLOYD,Any ideas about the colour?
1831,L3897,u57,m3,MICHAELS,"Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice."
1832,L3896,u55,m3,FLOYD,But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
1833,L3893,u57,m3,MICHAELS,Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
1834,L3892,u55,m3,FLOYD,Any clue as to what it is?
1835,L3891,u57,m3,MICHAELS,By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
1836,L3890,u55,m3,FLOYD,How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
1837,L3889,u57,m3,MICHAELS,"Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago."
1838,L3869,u55,m3,FLOYD,I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
1839,L3868,u57,m3,MICHAELS,"Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?"
1840,L3839,u59,m3,PILOT,"Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable."
1841,L3838,u55,m3,FLOYD,"No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern."
1842,L3837,u59,m3,PILOT,"Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?"
1843,L3834,u59,m3,PILOT,"Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already."
1844,L3833,u55,m3,FLOYD,"I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm."
1845,L3832,u59,m3,PILOT,"Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her."
1846,L3829,u59,m3,PILOT,I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
1847,L3828,u55,m3,FLOYD,I see.
1848,L3827,u59,m3,PILOT,Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
1849,L3826,u55,m3,FLOYD,What do you mean?
1850,L3825,u59,m3,PILOT,"Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?"
1851,L3824,u55,m3,FLOYD,Thank you.
1852,L3821,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine."
1853,L3820,u59,m3,PILOT,We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
1854,L3819,u55,m3,FLOYD,When do we arrive at Clavius?
1855,L3818,u59,m3,PILOT,There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
1856,L3817,u55,m3,FLOYD,"Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days."
1857,L4183,u60,m3,POOLE,"All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please."
1858,L4182,u56,m3,HAL,"Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure."
1859,L4181,u60,m3,POOLE,Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
1860,L4175,u60,m3,POOLE,Let me see the tracking alignment display.
1861,L4174,u56,m3,HAL,"I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure."
1862,L4170,u56,m3,HAL,It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
1863,L4169,u60,m3,POOLE,"Yes, Hal, what's up?"
1864,L4119,u60,m3,POOLE,Opening pod bay doors.
1865,L4118,u56,m3,HAL,Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
1866,L4113,u60,m3,POOLE,"Hal, check all airlock doors secure."
1867,L4112,u56,m3,HAL,Roger.
1868,L4111,u60,m3,POOLE,"Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition."
1869,L4110,u56,m3,HAL,I understand.
1870,L4109,u60,m3,POOLE,"Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit."
1871,L4108,u56,m3,HAL,"Five by five, Frank."
1872,L4097,u56,m3,HAL,Roger.
1873,L4096,u60,m3,POOLE,"Hal, have pod arms secure the component."
1874,L4033,u60,m3,POOLE,"Thank you very much, Hal."
1875,L4032,u56,m3,HAL,That's true.
1876,L4031,u60,m3,POOLE,"There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?"
1877,L4030,u56,m3,HAL,That's true
1878,L4029,u60,m3,POOLE,"Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?"
1879,L4028,u56,m3,HAL,That's true.
1880,L4025,u56,m3,HAL,That's true.
1881,L4024,u60,m3,POOLE,Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
1882,L4023,u56,m3,HAL,True.
1883,L4022,u60,m3,POOLE,Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
1884,L4021,u56,m3,HAL,"I will if I can, Frank."
1885,L4020,u60,m3,POOLE,"Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false."
1886,L5048,u75,m4,LUTHER,"Great, just great."
1887,L5047,u62,m4,ATTENDANT,That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
1888,L5046,u75,m4,LUTHER,How about chargin' the battery?
1889,L5045,u62,m4,ATTENDANT,"We don't wash 'em, ya know."
1890,L5044,u75,m4,LUTHER,"Yeah, I've been busy."
1891,L5043,u62,m4,ATTENDANT,This is three years old.
1892,L5042,u75,m4,LUTHER,Hammond.
1893,L5041,u62,m4,ATTENDANT,Name?
1894,L5040,u75,m4,LUTHER,I want to pick up my car.
1895,L5039,u62,m4,ATTENDANT,Yeah?
1896,L4925,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you..."
1897,L4924,u63,m4,BARTENDER,"I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know."
1898,L4923,u63,m4,BARTENDER,"Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know."
1899,L4922,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I don't give a damn about his girl...
1900,L4906,u63,m4,BARTENDER,I don't give a shit who you ask.
1901,L4905,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think."
1902,L4904,u63,m4,BARTENDER,Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
1903,L4903,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Now how's your memory doin'?
1904,L4900,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"No, man, I think I'll have a vodka."
1905,L4899,u63,m4,BARTENDER,Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
1906,L4898,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Vodka.
1907,L4897,u63,m4,BARTENDER,Yeah.
1908,L4568,u69,m4,GANZ,"And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw."
1909,L4567,u64,m4,BILLY,"Hey, what about me?"
1910,L4563,u64,m4,BILLY,"He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay."
1911,L4562,u69,m4,GANZ,Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
1912,L4511,u69,m4,GANZ,"Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?"
1913,L4510,u64,m4,BILLY,They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
1914,L4509,u69,m4,GANZ,It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
1915,L4508,u64,m4,BILLY,I never paid for it in my life.
1916,L4507,u69,m4,GANZ,"Yeah, dummy.  Money."
1917,L4506,u64,m4,BILLY,Pay money?
1918,L4505,u69,m4,GANZ,Pros.
1919,L4504,u64,m4,BILLY,"Whaddya mean, buy?"
1920,L4503,u69,m4,GANZ,Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
1921,L4502,u64,m4,BILLY,I ain't tired yet.
1922,L4501,u69,m4,GANZ,I want to drive awhile.
1923,L4454,u64,m4,BILLY,"You got a real big mouth, convict."
1924,L4453,u69,m4,GANZ,"Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto."
1925,L5371,u65,m4,CANDY,Now you're talkin'. See ya...
1926,L5370,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?"
1927,L5368,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me..."
1928,L5367,u65,m4,CANDY,"Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?"
1929,L5366,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Here you go, baby."
1930,L5216,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party."
1931,L5215,u65,m4,CANDY,"Hello, again."
1932,L5194,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Here's hoping, baby..."
1933,L5193,u65,m4,CANDY,"Well, maybe I'll see you later ..."
1934,L5188,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room..."
1935,L5187,u65,m4,CANDY,What's the matter with my place?
1936,L5186,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there..."
1937,L5185,u65,m4,CANDY,You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
1938,L5184,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Yeah, i been waiting three years."
1939,L5183,u65,m4,CANDY,You're in a hurry.
1940,L5182,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way."
1941,L5181,u65,m4,CANDY,"Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?"
1942,L5180,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Goodbye.
1943,L5179,u65,m4,CANDY,"No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'."
1944,L5178,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
1945,L5177,u65,m4,CANDY,"Hey, what kind of talk is that?"
1946,L5176,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?"
1947,L5175,u65,m4,CANDY,I'm candy...
1948,L5329,u66,m4,CASEY,In the back.  Down the other corridor.
1949,L5328,u67,m4,CATES,Where's ganz?
1950,L5325,u67,m4,CATES,"He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated."
1951,L5324,u66,m4,CASEY,No chance.
1952,L5323,u67,m4,CATES,You're gonna help us take him.
1953,L5322,u66,m4,CASEY,"Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be..."
1954,L5321,u67,m4,CATES,"You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls..."
1955,L5318,u67,m4,CATES,"No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast."
1956,L5317,u66,m4,CASEY,Would you guys...
1957,L5316,u67,m4,CATES,I hear you've got visitors.
1958,L4960,u66,m4,CASEY,I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
1959,L4959,u67,m4,CATES,How about it?
1960,L4945,u66,m4,CASEY,Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
1961,L4944,u67,m4,CATES,I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
1962,L5348,u69,m4,GANZ,I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
1963,L5347,u67,m4,CATES,You're done.  End of story.
1964,L5346,u69,m4,GANZ,I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
1965,L5340,u69,m4,GANZ,Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
1966,L5339,u67,m4,CATES,I don't think you're gonna make it.
1967,L5338,u69,m4,GANZ,"After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever..."
1968,L4629,u69,m4,GANZ,What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
1969,L4628,u67,m4,CATES,You lying son of a bitch...
1970,L5384,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?"
1971,L5383,u67,m4,CATES,Thanks.
1972,L5382,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
1973,L5381,u67,m4,CATES,"No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours."
1974,L5380,u71,m4,HAMMOND,You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
1975,L5379,u67,m4,CATES,"That's right. Not my style, Reggie.."
1976,L5378,u71,m4,HAMMOND,And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
1977,L5377,u67,m4,CATES,It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
1978,L5376,u67,m4,CATES,There's nothin' to talk about.
1979,L5375,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand."
1980,L5373,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic."
1981,L5372,u67,m4,CATES,"Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick."
1982,L5353,u67,m4,CATES,You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
1983,L5352,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
1984,L5351,u67,m4,CATES,You okay?
1985,L5314,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Well, you got to admit we come a long way."
1986,L5313,u67,m4,CATES,Partnership?
1987,L5312,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started."
1988,L5311,u67,m4,CATES,"Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps..."
1989,L5310,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in."
1990,L5309,u67,m4,CATES,Whatever play I maker just back me up.
1991,L5308,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Hey, there she is..."
1992,L5307,u67,m4,CATES,"I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it."
1993,L5306,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro."
1994,L5305,u67,m4,CATES,"If she's right, and if you don't screw up."
1995,L5304,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Do I get to kiss her too?
1996,L5291,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV..."
1997,L5290,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him..."
1998,L5257,u67,m4,CATES,Don't worry about it.
1999,L5256,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"It's late, they're closing..."
2000,L5255,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Yeah, but we didn't get 'em."
2001,L5254,u67,m4,CATES,"Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it."
2002,L5253,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down."
2003,L5252,u67,m4,CATES,"I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present."
2004,L5251,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
2005,L5250,u67,m4,CATES,"I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam."
2006,L5249,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Hey, how'd my car get here?"
2007,L5237,u67,m4,CATES,Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
2008,L5236,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Notice something funny about that bus?
2009,L5227,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Luther's on the move...
2010,L5226,u67,m4,CATES,Why?
2011,L5225,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go."
2012,L5224,u67,m4,CATES,That was quick.
2013,L5213,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
2014,L5212,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, I see her."
2015,L5210,u67,m4,CATES,Yeah. Guess not.
2016,L5209,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ..."
2017,L5208,u67,m4,CATES,"Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job."
2018,L5207,u71,m4,HAMMOND,You sure that's the reason?
2019,L5206,u67,m4,CATES,"I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue..."
2020,L5205,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
2021,L5204,u67,m4,CATES,Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
2022,L5202,u67,m4,CATES,So you took the rest of the night off...
2023,L5201,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the ""Don't Disturb"" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind."
2024,L5200,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
2025,L5199,u67,m4,CATES,Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
2026,L5198,u71,m4,HAMMOND,You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
2027,L5197,u67,m4,CATES,We missed.
2028,L5196,u71,m4,HAMMOND,What about Ganz?
2029,L5195,u67,m4,CATES,What about Luther?
2030,L5192,u67,m4,CATES,Hello. And goodbye.
2031,L5191,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
2032,L5190,u67,m4,CATES,Where's luther?
2033,L5172,u67,m4,CATES,"I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?"
2034,L5171,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers."
2035,L5085,u71,m4,HAMMOND,No way...
2036,L5084,u67,m4,CATES,You stay with me...
2037,L5083,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
2038,L5077,u67,m4,CATES,"Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set."
2039,L5076,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"That was in style a couple years back, man."
2040,L5074,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?"
2041,L5073,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?"
2042,L5072,u67,m4,CATES,"Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife."
2043,L5071,u71,m4,HAMMOND,No class...
2044,L5070,u67,m4,CATES,"What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks."
2045,L5069,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job."
2046,L5068,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy..."
2047,L5067,u71,m4,HAMMOND,A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
2048,L5066,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb."
2049,L5065,u67,m4,CATES,Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
2050,L5064,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile..."
2051,L5063,u67,m4,CATES,I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
2052,L5062,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Doesn't it get... Tiring?
2053,L5061,u67,m4,CATES,If they don't tell me what I need to know...
2054,L5060,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?"
2055,L5059,u67,m4,CATES,That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
2056,L5058,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it."
2057,L5057,u67,m4,CATES,I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
2058,L5056,u67,m4,CATES,"Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?"
2059,L5055,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
2060,L5054,u67,m4,CATES,"If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town."
2061,L5053,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world."
2062,L5052,u67,m4,CATES,You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
2063,L5051,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
2064,L5050,u67,m4,CATES,Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
2065,L5049,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?"
2066,L5038,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
2067,L5037,u67,m4,CATES,Musta got some primo bondsman.
2068,L5036,u71,m4,HAMMOND,What?
2069,L5035,u67,m4,CATES,Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
2070,L5034,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
2071,L5033,u67,m4,CATES,"You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time."
2072,L5030,u67,m4,CATES,Shit.
2073,L5029,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack."
2074,L5028,u67,m4,CATES,You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
2075,L5025,u71,m4,HAMMOND,You just drove by it.
2076,L5024,u67,m4,CATES,...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
2077,L5023,u71,m4,HAMMOND,This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
2078,L5022,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"You're a real case, you know that, Jack?"
2079,L5021,u67,m4,CATES,Where's the goddamn car?
2080,L5020,u67,m4,CATES,Yeah.  Right.
2081,L5019,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met."
2082,L5018,u67,m4,CATES,"Right, partner."
2083,L5017,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?"
2084,L5016,u67,m4,CATES,Where's the money?
2085,L5014,u67,m4,CATES,Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
2086,L5013,u71,m4,HAMMOND,You gonna let me keep any of it?
2087,L5012,u67,m4,CATES,"Not likely, convict."
2088,L5011,u71,m4,HAMMOND,We split 50-50?
2089,L5010,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?"
2090,L5009,u67,m4,CATES,He's after your money.
2091,L5008,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun."
2092,L5007,u67,m4,CATES,Just tell me about the money.
2093,L5005,u67,m4,CATES,Jesus.
2094,L5004,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Half a million.
2095,L5003,u67,m4,CATES,How much?
2096,L5002,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I been waiting a long time for some money.
2097,L4997,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story."
2098,L4996,u67,m4,CATES,"They saved your ass, convict."
2099,L4995,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time."
2100,L4994,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, right.  You want to try again?"
2101,L4975,u67,m4,CATES,Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
2102,L4974,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
2103,L4973,u67,m4,CATES,Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
2104,L4972,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night."
2105,L4971,u67,m4,CATES,"You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'..."
2106,L4970,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself."
2107,L4969,u67,m4,CATES,"This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you."
2108,L4965,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
2109,L4964,u67,m4,CATES,Let's go.
2110,L4939,u67,m4,CATES,Come on.
2111,L4938,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Must be billy's girl.
2112,L4937,u67,m4,CATES,There.
2113,L4930,u67,m4,CATES,"While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too."
2114,L4929,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"You made that move, huh?"
2115,L4912,u67,m4,CATES,"Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer."
2116,L4911,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control."
2117,L4896,u67,m4,CATES,My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
2118,L4895,u71,m4,HAMMOND,This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
2119,L4894,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
2120,L4893,u67,m4,CATES,"I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge."
2121,L4891,u67,m4,CATES,The bet's off.
2122,L4890,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
2123,L4889,u67,m4,CATES,"You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it."
2124,L4888,u71,m4,HAMMOND,What are you talkin' about?
2125,L4887,u67,m4,CATES,I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
2126,L4886,u71,m4,HAMMOND,That's never been one of my problems.
2127,L4885,u67,m4,CATES,Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
2128,L4884,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid..."
2129,L4883,u67,m4,CATES,"I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with."
2130,L4882,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Hey, you wanna bet?"
2131,L4881,u67,m4,CATES,You need five years training to handle a joint like...
2132,L4880,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
2133,L4879,u67,m4,CATES,Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
2134,L4878,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats..."
2135,L4877,u67,m4,CATES,"If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up..."
2136,L4876,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
2137,L4875,u67,m4,CATES,"This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece..."
2138,L4874,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it."
2139,L4873,u67,m4,CATES,Well?
2140,L4871,u71,m4,HAMMOND,At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
2141,L4870,u67,m4,CATES,Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
2142,L4869,u71,m4,HAMMOND,You have a good time?
2143,L4868,u67,m4,CATES,Last night.
2144,L4867,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Last night, two nights ago, three?"
2145,L4866,u67,m4,CATES,I don't give out the details.
2146,L4864,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
2147,L4863,u67,m4,CATES,"Now, where we goin', convict?"
2148,L4861,u67,m4,CATES,"She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?"
2149,L4860,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?"
2150,L4858,u67,m4,CATES,Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
2151,L4857,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
2152,L4855,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor."
2153,L4854,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat."
2154,L4853,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music..."
2155,L4852,u67,m4,CATES,We eat when I say we eat.
2156,L4851,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
2157,L4850,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning."
2158,L4849,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
2159,L4848,u67,m4,CATES,We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
2160,L4828,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?"
2161,L4827,u67,m4,CATES,He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
2162,L4826,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"I think you better put him on ice, man."
2163,L4825,u67,m4,CATES,What do you think?
2164,L4816,u67,m4,CATES,Want to try it again?
2165,L4815,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Thank you.
2166,L4814,u67,m4,CATES,"Hey, this works pretty good."
2167,L4803,u67,m4,CATES,Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
2168,L4802,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
2169,L4801,u67,m4,CATES,I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
2170,L4800,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man."
2171,L4792,u67,m4,CATES,"I'm helpin' you, huh?"
2172,L4791,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me."
2173,L4790,u67,m4,CATES,Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
2174,L4789,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company."
2175,L4788,u67,m4,CATES,I may call you worse than that.
2176,L4787,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
2177,L4786,u67,m4,CATES,I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
2178,L4785,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'."
2179,L4784,u67,m4,CATES,"I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack."
2180,L4783,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"What gang you talkin' about, Jack?"
2181,L4782,u67,m4,CATES,Luther was part of the gang?
2182,L4781,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away."
2183,L4780,u67,m4,CATES,"Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?"
2184,L4779,u71,m4,HAMMOND,It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
2185,L4778,u67,m4,CATES,Yeah.
2186,L4775,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Shit.  I'm already sorry.
2187,L4774,u67,m4,CATES,"Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met."
2188,L4773,u71,m4,HAMMOND,No way to start a partnership.
2189,L4772,u67,m4,CATES,"You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass."
2190,L4771,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal."
2191,L4770,u71,m4,HAMMOND,You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
2192,L4769,u67,m4,CATES,I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
2193,L4766,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies..."
2194,L4765,u67,m4,CATES,"We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers..."
2195,L4764,u71,m4,HAMMOND,What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
2196,L4763,u67,m4,CATES,This prison gives out $400 suits?
2197,L4751,u67,m4,CATES,I'll think about it.
2198,L4750,u71,m4,HAMMOND,It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
2199,L4749,u67,m4,CATES,Bullshit.
2200,L4748,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I got a lot to protect.
2201,L4747,u67,m4,CATES,What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
2202,L4746,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here."
2203,L4745,u67,m4,CATES,You're crazy.
2204,L4744,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
2205,L4743,u67,m4,CATES,Yeah?
2206,L4741,u67,m4,CATES,Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
2207,L4740,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
2208,L4739,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, I noticed..."
2209,L4732,u67,m4,CATES,"Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help."
2210,L4731,u71,m4,HAMMOND,You here to write my life story?
2211,L4729,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Sure, anything you want."
2212,L4728,u67,m4,CATES,"Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?"
2213,L4727,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"You got a name, cop?"
2214,L5245,u67,m4,CATES,I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
2215,L5244,u70,m4,HADEN,Where the Christ do you think you're going?
2216,L5243,u70,m4,HADEN,"Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?."
2217,L5242,u67,m4,CATES,He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
2218,L5104,u70,m4,HADEN,"Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike."
2219,L5103,u67,m4,CATES,I didn't have the time.
2220,L5102,u70,m4,HADEN,Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
2221,L5101,u67,m4,CATES,"Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds."
2222,L5100,u70,m4,HADEN,What a screw-up.
2223,L5099,u70,m4,HADEN,You couldn't get to him?
2224,L5098,u67,m4,CATES,The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
2225,L5097,u70,m4,HADEN,Which one pulled the trigger?
2226,L5096,u67,m4,CATES,They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
2227,L5095,u70,m4,HADEN,How did they get away?
2228,L5094,u67,m4,CATES,"I lost them, that's what happened."
2229,L5093,u70,m4,HADEN,What the bell happened?
2230,L4703,u67,m4,CATES,I'll keep it in mind.
2231,L4702,u70,m4,HADEN,Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
2232,L4701,u67,m4,CATES,Yeah?
2233,L4700,u70,m4,HADEN,Jack?
2234,L4699,u67,m4,CATES,You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
2235,L4698,u70,m4,HADEN,"Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down."
2236,L4697,u67,m4,CATES,"Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead..."
2237,L4696,u70,m4,HADEN,"You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack."
2238,L4695,u67,m4,CATES,Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
2239,L4694,u70,m4,HADEN,Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
2240,L4693,u67,m4,CATES,Yeah...
2241,L4692,u70,m4,HADEN,"Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different."
2242,L4691,u67,m4,CATES,"Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back."
2243,L4690,u70,m4,HADEN,"Yeah, I read the report..."
2244,L4689,u67,m4,CATES,I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
2245,L4644,u77,m4,YOUNG COP,I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
2246,L4643,u67,m4,CATES,"Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap."
2247,L4642,u77,m4,YOUNG COP,"Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report."
2248,L4639,u67,m4,CATES,"The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?"
2249,L4638,u77,m4,YOUNG COP,But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
2250,L4637,u67,m4,CATES,Yeah.
2251,L4636,u77,m4,YOUNG COP,"That's what you say, Cates..."
2252,L5163,u73,m4,KEHOE,I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
2253,L5162,u67,m4,CATES,Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
2254,L5159,u67,m4,CATES,What?
2255,L5158,u73,m4,KEHOE,I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
2256,L5145,u73,m4,KEHOE,"Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest..."
2257,L5144,u67,m4,CATES,I got to wait for a call.
2258,L5143,u73,m4,KEHOE,I'm heading out. How about you?
2259,L5142,u67,m4,CATES,Bullshit red tape.
2260,L5138,u73,m4,KEHOE,Nothing.
2261,L5137,u67,m4,CATES,Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
2262,L5136,u73,m4,KEHOE,Doesn't look like it.
2263,L5135,u67,m4,CATES,"Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong."
2264,L5134,u73,m4,KEHOE,"Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you."
2265,L5133,u67,m4,CATES,So do you...been a long day.
2266,L5132,u73,m4,KEHOE,You look awful.
2267,L4687,u67,m4,CATES,One of  em's in the slam.
2268,L4686,u73,m4,KEHOE,Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
2269,L4685,u67,m4,CATES,I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
2270,L4682,u73,m4,KEHOE,Hey ... Dick Tracy.
2271,L4681,u67,m4,CATES,Tell me that's not the same guy.
2272,L4680,u73,m4,KEHOE,"Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job."
2273,L4679,u67,m4,CATES,"Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?"
2274,L4678,u73,m4,KEHOE,They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
2275,L4677,u67,m4,CATES,Who are all these?
2276,L4676,u73,m4,KEHOE,Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
2277,L4675,u67,m4,CATES,Billy Bear...
2278,L4673,u67,m4,CATES,Shit.
2279,L4672,u73,m4,KEHOE,"This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours."
2280,L4671,u67,m4,CATES,I'll help you out.
2281,L4670,u73,m4,KEHOE,Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
2282,L4669,u67,m4,CATES,Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
2283,L4823,u75,m4,LUTHER,I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
2284,L4822,u67,m4,CATES,When? How?
2285,L4821,u75,m4,LUTHER,He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
2286,L4819,u75,m4,LUTHER,I don't know.
2287,L4818,u67,m4,CATES,"I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her."
2288,L4817,u75,m4,LUTHER,"Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie."
2289,L4813,u75,m4,LUTHER,Who gives a fuck what you think?
2290,L4812,u67,m4,CATES,"You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is."
2291,L4811,u75,m4,LUTHER,Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
2292,L4810,u67,m4,CATES,I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
2293,L4809,u75,m4,LUTHER,A cop...
2294,L5365,u67,m4,CATES,That's what I always say.
2295,L5364,u68,m4,ELAINE,You're impossible...
2296,L5363,u67,m4,CATES,He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
2297,L5362,u68,m4,ELAINE,Tell me.
2298,L5361,u67,m4,CATES,"Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind..."
2299,L5360,u68,m4,ELAINE,Where is he?
2300,L5359,u67,m4,CATES,Three more hours...
2301,L5358,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works."
2302,L5357,u68,m4,ELAINE,I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
2303,L5356,u67,m4,CATES,"Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this."
2304,L5355,u68,m4,ELAINE,How'd they take it back at headquarters?
2305,L5303,u67,m4,CATES,"Let's go, Reggie."
2306,L5302,u68,m4,ELAINE,What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
2307,L5301,u67,m4,CATES,Whaddya think?
2308,L5298,u68,m4,ELAINE,"Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out."
2309,L5297,u67,m4,CATES,"Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend."
2310,L5296,u68,m4,ELAINE,"When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible."
2311,L5295,u67,m4,CATES,So what?
2312,L5294,u68,m4,ELAINE,"It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him."
2313,L5293,u67,m4,CATES,"Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party."
2314,L5292,u68,m4,ELAINE,"What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?"
2315,L5287,u68,m4,ELAINE,"Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian..."
2316,L5286,u67,m4,CATES,How do you know?
2317,L5285,u68,m4,ELAINE,Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
2318,L5284,u67,m4,CATES,Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
2319,L5276,u67,m4,CATES,"I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian."
2320,L5275,u68,m4,ELAINE,You real down?
2321,L5263,u67,m4,CATES,We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
2322,L5262,u68,m4,ELAINE,"I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?"
2323,L5261,u67,m4,CATES,Don't.  We've had a hard night.
2324,L5260,u68,m4,ELAINE,I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
2325,L5259,u67,m4,CATES,"Hiya, kid."
2326,L5258,u68,m4,ELAINE,"Hey, I don't believe it."
2327,L5221,u68,m4,ELAINE,Fuck you.
2328,L5220,u67,m4,CATES,"Hi, it's me..."
2329,L5219,u68,m4,ELAINE,Hello.
2330,L5169,u67,m4,CATES,"Just a second, that's all!"
2331,L5168,u68,m4,ELAINE,"Jack, wait..."
2332,L5167,u67,m4,CATES,"Elaine, I gotta put you on hold..."
2333,L5165,u68,m4,ELAINE,Jack?  What was that?
2334,L5164,u67,m4,CATES,The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
2335,L5153,u68,m4,ELAINE,So am I.
2336,L5152,u67,m4,CATES,"No, it's I'm just surprised you called."
2337,L5151,u68,m4,ELAINE,No wonder you're so popular.
2338,L5150,u67,m4,CATES,Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
2339,L5149,u68,m4,ELAINE,"I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?"
2340,L4840,u68,m4,ELAINE,This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
2341,L4839,u67,m4,CATES,"Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?"
2342,L4837,u67,m4,CATES,"Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there."
2343,L4836,u68,m4,ELAINE,Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
2344,L4718,u68,m4,ELAINE,"I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it."
2345,L4717,u67,m4,CATES,That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
2346,L4716,u68,m4,ELAINE,Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
2347,L4715,u67,m4,CATES,"I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit."
2348,L4714,u68,m4,ELAINE,"Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function..."
2349,L4713,u67,m4,CATES,"Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ..."
2350,L4712,u68,m4,ELAINE,"Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun..."
2351,L4709,u67,m4,CATES,"Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ..."
2352,L4708,u68,m4,ELAINE,"Jack, are you okay?"
2353,L4707,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day..."
2354,L4706,u68,m4,ELAINE,You made the front page.
2355,L4705,u67,m4,CATES,"Yeah, one of my favorites."
2356,L4704,u68,m4,ELAINE,Great place for lunch.
2357,L4535,u67,m4,CATES,Guess people ought to know who I am...
2358,L4534,u68,m4,ELAINE,I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
2359,L4533,u67,m4,CATES,Thanks for the coffee.
2360,L4532,u68,m4,ELAINE,"Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure..."
2361,L4531,u67,m4,CATES,You sure you want me to?
2362,L4530,u68,m4,ELAINE,Call me later.
2363,L4529,u67,m4,CATES,"That's the way I see it, too."
2364,L4528,u68,m4,ELAINE,"You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless."
2365,L4525,u68,m4,ELAINE,I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
2366,L4524,u67,m4,CATES,What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
2367,L4523,u68,m4,ELAINE,When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
2368,L4522,u67,m4,CATES,Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
2369,L4521,u68,m4,ELAINE,Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
2370,L4520,u67,m4,CATES,Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
2371,L4519,u68,m4,ELAINE,That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
2372,L4517,u68,m4,ELAINE,Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
2373,L4516,u67,m4,CATES,Maybe you ought to buy me one.
2374,L4514,u67,m4,CATES,What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
2375,L4513,u68,m4,ELAINE,"You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning."
2376,L4488,u67,m4,CATES,"I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em."
2377,L4487,u68,m4,ELAINE,Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
2378,L4486,u67,m4,CATES,"Hey, you know what I really think?"
2379,L4485,u68,m4,ELAINE,"If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference."
2380,L4484,u67,m4,CATES,I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
2381,L4483,u68,m4,ELAINE,Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
2382,L4482,u67,m4,CATES,Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
2383,L4481,u68,m4,ELAINE,"Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do..."
2384,L4480,u67,m4,CATES,I guess he got the message...
2385,L4479,u68,m4,ELAINE,Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
2386,L4478,u67,m4,CATES,What'd you do?
2387,L4477,u68,m4,ELAINE,A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
2388,L4476,u67,m4,CATES,What's wrong with that?
2389,L4475,u68,m4,ELAINE,I'm all wet.
2390,L4474,u67,m4,CATES,"That's the way I see it, too."
2391,L4473,u68,m4,ELAINE,You're hopeless.
2392,L4472,u67,m4,CATES,"Hey, you're right."
2393,L4471,u68,m4,ELAINE,I still don't think it's loaded.
2394,L4470,u67,m4,CATES,"This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?"
2395,L4469,u68,m4,ELAINE,I don't think your gun's loaded...
2396,L4468,u67,m4,CATES,"I don't answer questions, I ask 'em..."
2397,L4467,u68,m4,ELAINE,What am I wanted for?
2398,L5289,u68,m4,ELAINE,"In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?"
2399,L5288,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you..."
2400,L5282,u68,m4,ELAINE,That's no bull.
2401,L5281,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Hey, two days with him is enough."
2402,L5280,u68,m4,ELAINE,How would you know?
2403,L5279,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Hard man to live with.
2404,L5268,u68,m4,ELAINE,"Shrink major, not a shrink."
2405,L5267,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress..."
2406,L5266,u68,m4,ELAINE,I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
2407,L5265,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine."
2408,L5264,u68,m4,ELAINE,Who the hell are you?
2409,L4613,u74,m4,LISA,"Alright, I'm coming...hold on."
2410,L4612,u69,m4,GANZ,Keep stallin'.
2411,L4610,u74,m4,LISA,What do you want?
2412,L4609,u69,m4,GANZ,Stall.
2413,L4604,u69,m4,GANZ,Shut up.
2414,L4603,u74,m4,LISA,What do you want?  What's goin' on?
2415,L4602,u74,m4,LISA,What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
2416,L4601,u69,m4,GANZ,Shut up.
2417,L4600,u74,m4,LISA,Hey...
2418,L4500,u72,m4,HENRY,"Sure, right."
2419,L4499,u69,m4,GANZ,"We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?"
2420,L4498,u72,m4,HENRY,"Yeah, old times."
2421,L4497,u69,m4,GANZ,We got a lot to talk about.
2422,L4496,u72,m4,HENRY,Can't complain.
2423,L4495,u69,m4,GANZ,How ya doin'?
2424,L4494,u72,m4,HENRY,"Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature."
2425,L4493,u69,m4,GANZ,How hot are they?
2426,L5234,u69,m4,GANZ,What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
2427,L5233,u75,m4,LUTHER,"Rosalie, you okay?"
2428,L5231,u69,m4,GANZ,"First, the money."
2429,L5230,u75,m4,LUTHER,Let her go.
2430,L4559,u69,m4,GANZ,"You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe."
2431,L4558,u75,m4,LUTHER,"Come on, you can trust me. Please."
2432,L4555,u75,m4,LUTHER,"Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away..."
2433,L4554,u69,m4,GANZ,You chickenshit punk...
2434,L4553,u75,m4,LUTHER,I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
2435,L4552,u69,m4,GANZ,When?
2436,L4551,u75,m4,LUTHER,No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
2437,L4550,u69,m4,GANZ,"Billy, go ahead, break it..."
2438,L4549,u75,m4,LUTHER,"Don't give me this, we were partners."
2439,L4548,u69,m4,GANZ,"Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me..."
2440,L4547,u69,m4,GANZ,You want that Indian to snap her neck?
2441,L4546,u75,m4,LUTHER,I don't know what you're talkin' about.
2442,L4545,u69,m4,GANZ,"I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid..."
2443,L4544,u75,m4,LUTHER,Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
2444,L4543,u69,m4,GANZ,"Surprise, Luther."
2445,L5125,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
2446,L5124,u76,m4,SOSNA,Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
2447,L5123,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Try and take it.
2448,L5122,u76,m4,SOSNA,Give it back.
2449,L5121,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?"
2450,L5120,u76,m4,SOSNA,This ain't a credit business.
2451,L5119,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Five.  On credit.
2452,L5118,u76,m4,SOSNA,Five bills.
2453,L5117,u71,m4,HAMMOND,Don't mess with me. How much?
2454,L5116,u76,m4,SOSNA,This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
2455,L5115,u71,m4,HAMMOND,How much?
2456,L5114,u76,m4,SOSNA,It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
2457,L5113,u71,m4,HAMMOND,How about some ammo?
2458,L5110,u71,m4,HAMMOND,I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
2459,L5109,u76,m4,SOSNA,You sure?
2460,L5108,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"Naw, right here's okay."
2461,L5107,u76,m4,SOSNA,You want to go outside?
2462,L5106,u76,m4,SOSNA,"Not bad, not bad."
2463,L5105,u71,m4,HAMMOND,"How you doing, man?"
2464,L5890,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
2465,L5889,u85,m5,LEELOO,Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
2466,L5876,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice."
2467,L5875,u85,m5,LEELOO,"Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!"
2468,L5693,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,You know exactly where they are!
2469,L5692,u85,m5,LEELOO,Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
2470,L5680,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,The case was stolen?
2471,L5679,u85,m5,LEELOO,San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
2472,L5678,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,The case..with the stones... Where is it?
2473,L5674,u85,m5,LEELOO,Napoleon... small.
2474,L5673,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,What're you laughing about?
2475,L5645,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,At your service.
2476,L5644,u85,m5,LEELOO,Corn-i-Lius?
2477,L5643,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
2478,L5761,u99,m5,ZORG,I know...
2479,L5760,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"You are a monster, Zorg!"
2480,L5756,u99,m5,ZORG,Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
2481,L5755,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
2482,L5754,u99,m5,ZORG,"Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!"
2483,L5752,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,They are robots!
2484,L5751,u99,m5,ZORG,"...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!"
2485,L5748,u99,m5,ZORG,"Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass."
2486,L5747,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,No thank you.
2487,L5746,u99,m5,ZORG,...would you like a drink?
2488,L5745,u99,m5,ZORG,"Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain..."
2489,L5744,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it."
2490,L5743,u99,m5,ZORG,Why?  What's wrong with me?
2491,L5742,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
2492,L5741,u99,m5,ZORG,"Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me..."
2493,L5740,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
2494,L5739,u99,m5,ZORG,"I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?"
2495,L5738,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
2496,L5737,u99,m5,ZORG,Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
2497,L5711,u99,m5,ZORG,I'm fucked!
2498,L5710,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,...We're saved!
2499,L6266,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,That's what I'm saying.
2500,L6265,u84,m5,KORBEN,"And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?"
2501,L6264,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work."
2502,L6263,u84,m5,KORBEN,There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
2503,L6259,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!"
2504,L6258,u84,m5,KORBEN,Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
2505,L6172,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
2506,L6171,u84,m5,KORBEN,When is she not in trouble?
2507,L6170,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Leeloo's in trouble?
2508,L6169,u84,m5,KORBEN,"Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo."
2509,L6168,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
2510,L5840,u84,m5,KORBEN,Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
2511,L5839,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,What are you doing?
2512,L5833,u84,m5,KORBEN,"Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks."
2513,L5832,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Of course.
2514,L5831,u84,m5,KORBEN,Good luck..
2515,L5830,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,We have to save the world.
2516,L5829,u84,m5,KORBEN,What kind of mission?
2517,L5828,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
2518,L5827,u84,m5,KORBEN,Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
2519,L5826,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston."
2520,L5658,u84,m5,KORBEN,That's what I thought.
2521,L5657,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"It means, ""Never without my permission""."
2522,L5656,u84,m5,KORBEN,Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
2523,L5655,u84,m5,KORBEN,I know. I was there when she arrived.
2524,L5654,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip."
2525,L5653,u84,m5,KORBEN,"I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?"
2526,L5652,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
2527,L5651,u84,m5,KORBEN,Dallas. Korben Dallas.
2528,L5650,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
2529,L5649,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,She's an exception..
2530,L5648,u84,m5,KORBEN,"They all like this in your family, father?"
2531,L5628,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins.."
2532,L5627,u84,m5,KORBEN,So you do know her.
2533,L5626,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!"
2534,L5625,u84,m5,KORBEN,You noticed...
2535,L5624,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,He's a she!
2536,L5622,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,The girl?
2537,L5621,u84,m5,KORBEN,I brought the girl remember?
2538,L5620,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Who are you?
2539,L5617,u84,m5,KORBEN,She dropped in on me... holding this.
2540,L5616,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
2541,L5615,u84,m5,KORBEN,"She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here."
2542,L5614,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
2543,L5613,u84,m5,KORBEN,"Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest."
2544,L5557,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,"This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father."
2545,L5556,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,What are we going to do?
2546,L5522,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"Thank you, Mr. President."
2547,L5521,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
2548,L5516,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
2549,L5515,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
2550,L5512,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Yes..thank God..
2551,L5511,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,Is there anything that can stop it?
2552,L5510,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
2553,L5509,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,And then?
2554,L5508,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions."
2555,L5470,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
2556,L5469,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important."
2557,L5468,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
2558,L5464,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,One more reason to shoot first eh?
2559,L5463,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL."
2560,L6252,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!"
2561,L6251,u79,m5,DAVID,You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
2562,L5913,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
2563,L5912,u79,m5,DAVID,On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
2564,L5911,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Where's Leeloo?
2565,L5731,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there."
2566,L5730,u79,m5,DAVID,I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
2567,L5689,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Perfect.
2568,L5688,u79,m5,DAVID,They really made her...
2569,L5687,u79,m5,DAVID,I didn't know your size.
2570,L5686,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
2571,L5676,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Yes. Of course..
2572,L5675,u79,m5,DAVID,"Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time.."
2573,L5672,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know."
2574,L5671,u79,m5,DAVID,What's she doing?
2575,L5647,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
2576,L5646,u79,m5,DAVID,Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
2577,L5637,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,"The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!"
2578,L5636,u79,m5,DAVID,"Father, will you please explain what's going on?"
2579,L5632,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
2580,L5631,u79,m5,DAVID,What is?
2581,L5630,u78,m5,CORNELIUS,It's a miracle!!!
2582,L6124,u80,m5,DIVA,They are... with me...
2583,L6123,u84,m5,KORBEN,"I'm sorry, but... the Stones..."
2584,L6120,u80,m5,DIVA,I would like to have died in peace...
2585,L6119,u84,m5,KORBEN,"Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again."
2586,L6118,u80,m5,DIVA,I don't have time... I need to know.
2587,L6117,u84,m5,KORBEN,I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
2588,L6116,u80,m5,DIVA,Do you love her?
2589,L6115,u84,m5,KORBEN,"I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!"
2590,L6114,u80,m5,DIVA,She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
2591,L6110,u84,m5,KORBEN,...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
2592,L6109,u80,m5,DIVA,"Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them."
2593,L6108,u84,m5,KORBEN,Leeloo... is... she's...
2594,L6107,u80,m5,DIVA,The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
2595,L6106,u84,m5,KORBEN,Who?
2596,L6105,u80,m5,DIVA,You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
2597,L5670,u84,m5,KORBEN,Leeloo..
2598,L5669,u81,m5,FINGER,Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
2599,L5668,u84,m5,KORBEN,"5'7"", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect.."
2600,L5667,u81,m5,FINGER,"So, just how big was this fare?"
2601,L5666,u84,m5,KORBEN,Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
2602,L5665,u81,m5,FINGER,Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

2766,L6059,u84,m5,KORBEN,"No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!"
2767,L6058,u85,m5,LEELOO,I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
2768,L6057,u84,m5,KORBEN,Where you going?
2769,L6056,u85,m5,LEELOO,"OK, you can turn around!"

2782,L5958,u84,m5,KORBEN,You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
2783,L5957,u85,m5,LEELOO,All 900.

2789,L5947,u84,m5,KORBEN,"Yes! But ""love"" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!"
2790,L5946,u85,m5,LEELOO,Love...

2827,L5568,u87,m5,MACTILBURGH,"The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless.."
2828,L5567,u87,m5,MACTILBURGH,Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
2829,L5566,u90,m5,MUNRO,Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
2830,L5565,u87,m5,MACTILBURGH,This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
2831,L5564,u90,m5,MUNRO,Talk English Doc.
2832,L5563,u87,m5,MACTILBURGH,"It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000."
2833,L5562,u90,m5,MUNRO,Have you identified it?
2834,L5561,u87,m5,MACTILBURGH,Actually only one cell survived..
2835,L5560,u90,m5,MUNRO,This is all that survived?
2836,L6255,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,How much time is left?
2837,L6254,u90,m5,MUNRO,They just landed in the desert.
2838,L5774,u90,m5,MUNRO,"Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one."
2839,L5773,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,I want your best man on this!
2840,L5770,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,...What do you mean?
2841,L5769,u90,m5,MUNRO,The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
2842,L5768,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
2843,L5767,u90,m5,MUNRO,"I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies."
2844,L5480,u96,m5,STAEDERT,"I'm about to, Mr. President."
2845,L5479,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
2846,L5453,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,Gentlemen?
2847,L5452,u96,m5,STAEDERT,My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
2848,L5451,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,Recommendations.
2849,L5450,u96,m5,STAEDERT,Wait or act.
2850,L5449,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,Options.
2851,L5448,u96,m5,STAEDERT,Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
2852,L5447,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
2853,L5446,u96,m5,STAEDERT,"There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging.."
2854,L5445,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,"I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General."
2855,L5444,u96,m5,STAEDERT,"Perfect, Mr. President."
2856,L5443,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,Is that better?
2857,L5442,u96,m5,STAEDERT,"I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you ."
2858,L5441,u91,m5,PRESIDENT,"Staedert, do you read me?"
2859,L5407,u93,m5,PROFESSOR,To fame.. salud..
2860,L5406,u92,m5,PRIEST,Drink!
2861,L5405,u92,m5,PRIEST,Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
2862,L5404,u93,m5,PROFESSOR,A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
2863,L5400,u92,m5,PRIEST,Only too well... here you must be parched..
2864,L5399,u93,m5,PROFESSOR,Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
2865,L5398,u92,m5,PRIEST,Amen..
2866,L5397,u93,m5,PROFESSOR,"""..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."""
2867,L5396,u92,m5,PRIEST,"Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much.."
2868,L6225,u99,m5,ZORG,I'm not at the hotel!
2869,L6224,u94,m5,SECRETARY,"Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel."
2870,L6223,u99,m5,ZORG,Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
2871,L6222,u94,m5,SECRETARY,"Yes, Sir!"
2872,L6221,u99,m5,ZORG,Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
2873,L6220,u94,m5,SECRETARY,"Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?"
2874,L6219,u99,m5,ZORG,How's that? Can you hear me better now?
2875,L6012,u95,m5,SHADOW,...I can't wait to be among you.
2876,L6011,u99,m5,ZORG,The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
2877,L6009,u99,m5,ZORG,"Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled."
2878,L6008,u95,m5,SHADOW,How's our deal coming along?
2879,L6007,u99,m5,ZORG,Got it.
2880,L6006,u95,m5,SHADOW,Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
2881,L6005,u99,m5,ZORG,Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
2882,L6004,u95,m5,SHADOW,"...Not far, now."
2883,L6003,u99,m5,ZORG,No... not at all.  Where are you?
2884,L6002,u95,m5,SHADOW,Am I disturbing you?
2885,L7002,u114,m6,WELLES,I just talked to her.
2886,L7001,u100,m6,AMY,She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
2887,L7000,u100,m6,AMY,Tom... she's dead.
2888,L6999,u114,m6,WELLES,She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
2889,L6998,u100,m6,AMY,What?
2890,L6997,u114,m6,WELLES,Mrs. Christian.
2891,L6996,u100,m6,AMY,Who are you calling?
2892,L6993,u114,m6,WELLES,Amy...
2893,L6992,u100,m6,AMY,What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
2894,L6991,u114,m6,WELLES,Don't...
2895,L6990,u100,m6,AMY,You're killing me...
2896,L6989,u114,m6,WELLES,I don't know what to say
2897,L6988,u100,m6,AMY,"Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through..."
2898,L6987,u114,m6,WELLES,"Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us."
2899,L6986,u100,m6,AMY,You should have.
2900,L6985,u114,m6,WELLES,I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
2901,L6984,u100,m6,AMY,"No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!"
2902,L6983,u114,m6,WELLES,You don't understand...
2903,L6982,u100,m6,AMY,You couldn't?
2904,L6981,u114,m6,WELLES,I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
2905,L6980,u100,m6,AMY,You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
2906,L6979,u100,m6,AMY,You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
2907,L6978,u114,m6,WELLES,I don't know.  I'm sorry...
2908,L6977,u100,m6,AMY,Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
2909,L6976,u114,m6,WELLES,It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
2910,L6975,u100,m6,AMY,Tom...
2911,L6974,u114,m6,WELLES,"I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me..."
2912,L6973,u100,m6,AMY,"What's going on, Tom?  What happened?"
2913,L6972,u114,m6,WELLES,"I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?"
2914,L6971,u100,m6,AMY,What happened to you?
2915,L6964,u114,m6,WELLES,"Just do it, Amy, please, go."
2916,L6963,u100,m6,AMY,... What's going on?
2917,L6962,u114,m6,WELLES,"I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there"
2918,L6961,u100,m6,AMY,What's wrong?  Are you alright?
2919,L6960,u114,m6,WELLES,"Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there..."
2920,L6959,u100,m6,AMY,Tom?  Where have you been... ?
2921,L6958,u114,m6,WELLES,"Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully.."
2922,L6957,u100,m6,AMY,Hello?
2923,L6435,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
2924,L6434,u100,m6,AMY,Why the gun?
2925,L6433,u114,m6,WELLES,"It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation."
2926,L6432,u100,m6,AMY,I know.
2927,L6431,u114,m6,WELLES,Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
2928,L6430,u100,m6,AMY,I understand.
2929,L6429,u114,m6,WELLES,This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
2930,L6365,u100,m6,AMY,Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
2931,L6364,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
2932,L6363,u100,m6,AMY,You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
2933,L6362,u114,m6,WELLES,Sure.  I'll call the guy.
2934,L6361,u100,m6,AMY,You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
2935,L6352,u114,m6,WELLES,I love you.
2936,L6351,u100,m6,AMY,I love you.
2937,L6350,u114,m6,WELLES,"Honey, I'm not, please..."
2938,L6349,u100,m6,AMY,"You better not be smoking, that's all I can say."
2939,L6348,u114,m6,WELLES,"Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there."
2940,L6347,u100,m6,AMY,How's the detective business?
2941,L6344,u114,m6,WELLES,We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
2942,L6343,u100,m6,AMY,"Okay, I believe you."
2943,L6342,u114,m6,WELLES,"Well, I'm not smoking, okay?"
2944,L6341,u100,m6,AMY,I'm not accusing you...
2945,L6340,u114,m6,WELLES,"You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even ""hello,"" you accuse me... ?"
2946,L6339,u100,m6,AMY,Your clothing reeks of it.
2947,L6338,u114,m6,WELLES,Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
2948,L6337,u100,m6,AMY,What's this... have you been smoking... ?
2949,L6336,u114,m6,WELLES,Do you know how much I missed you?
2950,L6335,u100,m6,AMY,Welcome home.
2951,L6612,u101,m6,ANGRY DEALER,There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
2952,L6611,u114,m6,WELLES,You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
2953,L6610,u101,m6,ANGRY DEALER,"What you see is what I got, mister."
2954,L6609,u114,m6,WELLES,Snuff?
2955,L6608,u101,m6,ANGRY DEALER,There's nothing harder.
2956,L6607,u114,m6,WELLES,Anything harder?
2957,L6606,u101,m6,ANGRY DEALER,"Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free."
2958,L6605,u114,m6,WELLES,What are these?
2959,L6910,u102,m6,DINO,I promised him to Machine.
2960,L6909,u105,m6,EDDIE,What the fuck... !
2961,L6717,u102,m6,DINO,Nobody knows anything.
2962,L6716,u105,m6,EDDIE,Dino...
2963,L6715,u102,m6,DINO,"There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader."
2964,L6714,u105,m6,EDDIE,Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
2965,L6713,u102,m6,DINO,"Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?"
2966,L6712,u105,m6,EDDIE,I'm telling you...
2967,L6711,u102,m6,DINO,Bullshit.
2968,L6710,u105,m6,EDDIE,"The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop..."
2969,L6709,u102,m6,DINO,What are you talking about?
2970,L6708,u105,m6,EDDIE,"I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop."
2971,L6707,u102,m6,DINO,What do you want?
2972,L6864,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
2973,L6863,u114,m6,WELLES,"I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city..."
2974,L6862,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"Bring the film, or we kill him."
2975,L6861,u114,m6,WELLES,He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
2976,L6860,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
2977,L6859,u114,m6,WELLES,"Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go..."
2978,L6858,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,Friend of yours?
2979,L6853,u114,m6,WELLES,I remember him.
2980,L6852,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?"
2981,L6846,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat."
2982,L6845,u114,m6,WELLES,"Look, I don't know what this..."
2983,L6844,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully."
2984,L6842,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,Take out your gun!
2985,L6841,u114,m6,WELLES,What are you... ?
2986,L6840,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
2987,L6835,u114,m6,WELLES,Sure.
2988,L6834,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?"
2989,L6833,u114,m6,WELLES,What are these for?
2990,L6832,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,They should be here any minute.
2991,L6831,u114,m6,WELLES,Where are the women?
2992,L6830,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,Excellent.
2993,L6829,u114,m6,WELLES,Right here.
2994,L6828,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,You brought the money?
2995,L6815,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
2996,L6814,u114,m6,WELLES,Where's that?
2997,L6812,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
2998,L6811,u114,m6,WELLES,Machine's in?
2999,L6810,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
3000,L6808,u114,m6,WELLES,Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
3001,L6807,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?"
3002,L6806,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm camera shy.
3003,L6805,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,What's the problem?
3004,L6804,u114,m6,WELLES,I'd rather you didn't.
3005,L6803,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
3006,L6802,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good."
3007,L6801,u114,m6,WELLES,We can do that.
3008,L6800,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
3009,L6799,u114,m6,WELLES,"If it's not him, there's no deal."
3010,L6798,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,Machine.
3011,L6797,u114,m6,WELLES,And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
3012,L6796,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,I'll consider it.
3013,L6795,u114,m6,WELLES,I want to watch you work.
3014,L6794,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,And they are?
3015,L6793,u114,m6,WELLES,"Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations."
3016,L6792,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,Is it?
3017,L6791,u114,m6,WELLES,That's five thousand dollars.
3018,L6790,u114,m6,WELLES,Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
3019,L6789,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,You said something about money.
3020,L6784,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,Hmm.
3021,L6783,u114,m6,WELLES,A fellow investor.
3022,L6782,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?"
3023,L6781,u114,m6,WELLES,I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
3024,L6780,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,What can I do for you today?
3025,L6779,u114,m6,WELLES,It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
3026,L6936,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,You betrayed us.
3027,L6935,u105,m6,EDDIE,"You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?"
3028,L6912,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles..."
3029,L6911,u105,m6,EDDIE,... sorry...
3030,L6908,u105,m6,EDDIE,Fuck off.
3031,L6907,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,Leave him alone.
3032,L6906,u105,m6,EDDIE,You're a dead man.
3033,L6866,u105,m6,EDDIE,"Move it, dirtbag... !"
3034,L6865,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max."
3035,L6848,u103,m6,DINO VELVET,"Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed."
3036,L6847,u105,m6,EDDIE,Is that him?
3037,L6464,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,It's good what you're doing.
3038,L6463,u114,m6,WELLES,You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
3039,L6462,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,"It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after."
3040,L6461,u114,m6,WELLES,Any good?
3041,L6460,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,"Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall."
3042,L6454,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,"Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry."
3043,L6453,u114,m6,WELLES,They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
3044,L6452,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,"I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me..."
3045,L6451,u114,m6,WELLES,"They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear."
3046,L6450,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,I'm not so sure about this.
3047,L6449,u114,m6,WELLES,"This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal."
3048,L6448,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,Why don't they come to me?
3049,L6447,u114,m6,WELLES,For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
3050,L6446,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,We do.
3051,L6445,u114,m6,WELLES,I figured you share information.
3052,L6444,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
3053,L6443,u114,m6,WELLES,"Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright."
3054,L6442,u114,m6,WELLES,"Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out..."
3055,L6441,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,There are reasons for the way we do things here.
3056,L6440,u114,m6,WELLES,"What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens..."
3057,L6439,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,"Alright, Tom."
3058,L6438,u114,m6,WELLES,Call me Tom.
3059,L6437,u104,m6,DIRECTOR,"What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?"
3060,L7076,u105,m6,EDDIE,What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
3061,L7075,u114,m6,WELLES,"That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you ""felt like it.""  Almost makes you worse."
3062,L7074,u105,m6,EDDIE,I never killed anyone.
3063,L7073,u114,m6,WELLES,Easy enough for you.
3064,L7072,u105,m6,EDDIE,Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
3065,L7071,u114,m6,WELLES,Don't think I won't.
3066,L7070,u105,m6,EDDIE,Do it.
3067,L7067,u105,m6,EDDIE,I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
3068,L7066,u114,m6,WELLES,Where?  Show me where.
3069,L7065,u105,m6,EDDIE,I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
3070,L7064,u114,m6,WELLES,Show me where you buried her.
3071,L7063,u105,m6,EDDIE,You got absolute zero.
3072,L7062,u114,m6,WELLES,Stop talking.
3073,L7061,u105,m6,EDDIE,"You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing..."
3074,L7060,u105,m6,EDDIE,"Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?"
3075,L7059,u114,m6,WELLES,Keep moving.
3076,L7057,u114,m6,WELLES,Show me.
3077,L7056,u105,m6,EDDIE,Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
3078,L7055,u114,m6,WELLES,What did you do with her body?
3079,L7054,u105,m6,EDDIE,"There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work."
3080,L7053,u114,m6,WELLES,Nobody saw you bring her in?
3081,L7052,u105,m6,EDDIE,"What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop..."
3082,L7051,u114,m6,WELLES,Tell me what happened.
3083,L7050,u105,m6,EDDIE,"Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money."
3084,L7049,u114,m6,WELLES,You enjoy it?
3085,L7048,u105,m6,EDDIE,I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
3086,L7045,u114,m6,WELLES,Because we're going there.
3087,L7044,u105,m6,EDDIE,Why?
3088,L7043,u114,m6,WELLES,"Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it."
3089,L7039,u105,m6,EDDIE,"Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!"
3090,L7038,u114,m6,WELLES,I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
3091,L7037,u105,m6,EDDIE,What the fuck do you want from me?
3092,L7036,u114,m6,WELLES,"What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?"
3093,L7035,u105,m6,EDDIE,Something like that.
3094,L7034,u114,m6,WELLES,"So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out."
3095,L7033,u105,m6,EDDIE,It was a lot of fucking money.
3096,L7032,u114,m6,WELLES,That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
3097,L7031,u105,m6,EDDIE,"Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker."
3098,L7030,u114,m6,WELLES,How much did he pay you?
3099,L7029,u105,m6,EDDIE,Yeah.
3100,L7028,u114,m6,WELLES,Told him you could get him a snuff film.
3101,L7027,u105,m6,EDDIE,"Yeah, the fucking lawyer."
3102,L7026,u114,m6,WELLES,"Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up."
3103,L7025,u105,m6,EDDIE,"What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows."
3104,L7024,u114,m6,WELLES,"I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude."
3105,L7023,u105,m6,EDDIE,"I told you, I don't know."
3106,L7022,u114,m6,WELLES,I want his name.
3107,L7021,u105,m6,EDDIE,I don't know...
3108,L7020,u114,m6,WELLES,Who is Machine?
3109,L7019,u105,m6,EDDIE,What do you want?
3110,L7018,u114,m6,WELLES,Starting to recognize a pattern?
3111,L7017,u105,m6,EDDIE,Fuck you!
3112,L7016,u114,m6,WELLES,Don't ask questions.
3113,L7015,u105,m6,EDDIE,How'd you find me here?
3114,L7014,u114,m6,WELLES,Don't bore me with that bullshit.
3115,L7013,u105,m6,EDDIE,I'm gonna kill you.
3116,L6920,u114,m6,WELLES,"One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had..."
3117,L6919,u105,m6,EDDIE,What's he talking about?
3118,L6702,u114,m6,WELLES,"You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good."
3119,L6701,u105,m6,EDDIE,What the fuck are you.. ?
3120,L6700,u114,m6,WELLES,"You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago..."
3121,L6699,u105,m6,EDDIE,Who is this.
3122,L6698,u114,m6,WELLES,I know what you did.
3123,L6697,u105,m6,EDDIE,What?
3124,L6696,u114,m6,WELLES,I know what you did.
3125,L6695,u105,m6,EDDIE,"Yeah, who's this?"
3126,L6694,u114,m6,WELLES,Eddie.
3127,L6693,u105,m6,EDDIE,Celebrity Films.
3128,L6692,u105,m6,EDDIE,Fuck you!
3129,L6691,u107,m6,MALE VOICE,"Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you."
3130,L6690,u105,m6,EDDIE,"Look, you cocksucker..."
3131,L6689,u107,m6,MALE VOICE,"The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?"
3132,L6688,u105,m6,EDDIE,"Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?"
3133,L6687,u107,m6,MALE VOICE,"I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?"
3134,L6686,u105,m6,EDDIE,You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
3135,L6922,u114,m6,WELLES,"Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?"
3136,L6921,u106,m6,LONGDALE,He's lying.
3137,L6903,u114,m6,WELLES,"Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield."
3138,L6902,u106,m6,LONGDALE,Give me the film.
3139,L6901,u114,m6,WELLES,You'll get it when we get there.
3140,L6900,u106,m6,LONGDALE,Give me the film.
3141,L6899,u114,m6,WELLES,Fuck you.
3142,L6898,u106,m6,LONGDALE,You almost went over your limit.
3143,L6894,u106,m6,LONGDALE,Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
3144,L6893,u114,m6,WELLES,Enlighten me.
3145,L6892,u106,m6,LONGDALE,Isn't it incredibly obvious?
3146,L6891,u114,m6,WELLES,"Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?"
3147,L6890,u106,m6,LONGDALE,"A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain..."
3148,L6889,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm asking.
3149,L6888,u106,m6,LONGDALE,You're asking me why?
3150,L6887,u114,m6,WELLES,Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
3151,L6886,u106,m6,LONGDALE,You're making me very angry.
3152,L6885,u114,m6,WELLES,"Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?"
3153,L6884,u106,m6,LONGDALE,Shut your mouth and drive!
3154,L6883,u114,m6,WELLES,Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
3155,L6882,u106,m6,LONGDALE,Shut up.
3156,L6881,u114,m6,WELLES,"You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one..."
3157,L6880,u114,m6,WELLES,"Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her."
3158,L6879,u106,m6,LONGDALE,None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
3159,L6878,u114,m6,WELLES,"Except, you're willing commit murder with them."
3160,L6877,u106,m6,LONGDALE,They're no friends of mine.
3161,L6876,u114,m6,WELLES,Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
3162,L6875,u106,m6,LONGDALE,Never mind how I found you.
3163,L6874,u114,m6,WELLES,"That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?"
3164,L6873,u106,m6,LONGDALE,I was well compensated.
3165,L6872,u114,m6,WELLES,"Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money."
3166,L6871,u106,m6,LONGDALE,That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
3167,L6870,u114,m6,WELLES,"So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege."
3168,L6869,u106,m6,LONGDALE,Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
3169,L6868,u114,m6,WELLES,"You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself."
3170,L6380,u106,m6,LONGDALE,"Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval."
3171,L6379,u114,m6,WELLES,That's right.
3172,L6378,u106,m6,LONGDALE,You are a private investigator?
3173,L6377,u114,m6,WELLES,Of what sort?
3174,L6376,u106,m6,LONGDALE,"As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend."
3175,L6375,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm listening.
3176,L6374,u106,m6,LONGDALE,"Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you."
3177,L6824,u114,m6,WELLES,"It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever."
3178,L6823,u108,m6,MAX,Look... that's awful generous and everything...
3179,L6822,u114,m6,WELLES,It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
3180,L6821,u108,m6,MAX,What's this?
3181,L6819,u114,m6,WELLES,Nope.
3182,L6818,u108,m6,MAX,Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
3183,L6817,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
3184,L6816,u108,m6,MAX,What's next?
3185,L6788,u114,m6,WELLES,"""Devil"" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite."
3186,L6787,u108,m6,MAX,"I know if I had to pick, it'd be ""Choke,"" or ""Devil."""
3187,L6769,u108,m6,MAX,What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
3188,L6768,u114,m6,WELLES,You don't need to be here.
3189,L6765,u108,m6,MAX,"Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself ""Machine,"" that's what they call him.  Machine."
3190,L6764,u114,m6,WELLES,"Who is he, his name?"
3191,L6763,u108,m6,MAX,"I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players..."
3192,L6762,u114,m6,WELLES,Who is he?
3193,L6758,u114,m6,WELLES,"Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?"
3194,L6757,u108,m6,MAX,Wha... ?
3195,L6754,u114,m6,WELLES,"It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?"
3196,L6753,u108,m6,MAX,"Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?"
3197,L6752,u108,m6,MAX,Great.
3198,L6751,u114,m6,WELLES,It's their Presidential Suite.
3199,L6750,u108,m6,MAX,You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
3200,L6737,u108,m6,MAX,See ya.
3201,L6736,u114,m6,WELLES,"Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back."
3202,L6735,u108,m6,MAX,You want me to come out there and play private eye?
3203,L6734,u114,m6,WELLES,"Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses."
3204,L6733,u108,m6,MAX,"I'm a working stiff, pops."
3205,L6732,u114,m6,WELLES,"Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?"
3206,L6731,u108,m6,MAX,"He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art."
3207,L6730,u114,m6,WELLES,"Alright, I get the picture."
3208,L6729,u108,m6,MAX,"Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a..."
3209,L6728,u108,m6,MAX,"Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money..."
3210,L6727,u114,m6,WELLES,Where does he sell it?
3211,L6726,u108,m6,MAX,You're learning.
3212,L6725,u114,m6,WELLES,Specialty product.
3213,L6724,u108,m6,MAX,"His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish."
3214,L6723,u114,m6,WELLES,A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
3215,L6722,u108,m6,MAX,"Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo."
3216,L6637,u114,m6,WELLES,Good question.
3217,L6636,u108,m6,MAX,"So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?"
3218,L6635,u114,m6,WELLES,A daughter.
3219,L6634,u108,m6,MAX,I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
3220,L6633,u114,m6,WELLES,What about me?
3221,L6632,u108,m6,MAX,"You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?"
3222,L6631,u114,m6,WELLES,You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
3223,L6630,u108,m6,MAX,"Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers."
3224,L6629,u114,m6,WELLES,You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
3225,L6628,u108,m6,MAX,"I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?"
3226,L6627,u114,m6,WELLES,I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
3227,L6626,u108,m6,MAX,"I don't know, where are yours?"
3228,L6625,u114,m6,WELLES,Where are your parents?
3229,L6624,u108,m6,MAX,Twenty-five.
3230,L6623,u114,m6,WELLES,How old are you?
3231,L6622,u108,m6,MAX,"First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is."
3232,L6621,u114,m6,WELLES,What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
3233,L6620,u108,m6,MAX,I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
3234,L6619,u114,m6,WELLES,Snuff films.
3235,L6618,u108,m6,MAX,"There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one."
3236,L6617,u114,m6,WELLES,Child pornography.
3237,L6616,u108,m6,MAX,"What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product."
3238,L6615,u114,m6,WELLES,Interesting theory.
3239,L6614,u108,m6,MAX,"You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go."
3240,L6598,u108,m6,MAX,"Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight."
3241,L6597,u114,m6,WELLES,... Hello... ?
3242,L6596,u114,m6,WELLES,"See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me ""pops."""
3243,L6595,u108,m6,MAX,"Tomorrow night, I get off at eight."
3244,L6594,u114,m6,WELLES,Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
3245,L6593,u108,m6,MAX,"Sounds good, pops."
3246,L6592,u114,m6,WELLES,"Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days."
3247,L6591,u108,m6,MAX,"Four hundred a week, off the books."
3248,L6590,u114,m6,WELLES,How much do you make now?
3249,L6589,u108,m6,MAX,How much?
3250,L6588,u114,m6,WELLES,"Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money."
3251,L6587,u108,m6,MAX,From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
3252,L6586,u114,m6,WELLES,Not quite.
3253,L6585,u108,m6,MAX,You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
3254,L6584,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm not a cop.
3255,L6583,u108,m6,MAX,"You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me."
3256,L6582,u114,m6,WELLES,"Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now."
3257,L6581,u108,m6,MAX,There's not much illegal.
3258,L6580,u114,m6,WELLES,"Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally..."
3259,L6579,u108,m6,MAX,Max.
3260,L6578,u114,m6,WELLES,"What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?"
3261,L6577,u108,m6,MAX,"Three, four years."
3262,L6576,u114,m6,WELLES,How long you been working there?
3263,L6575,u114,m6,WELLES,Good for you.
3264,L6574,u108,m6,MAX,"I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight."
3265,L6571,u108,m6,MAX,Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
3266,L6570,u114,m6,WELLES,I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
3267,L6569,u108,m6,MAX,"Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would."
3268,L6568,u114,m6,WELLES,Remember me?
3269,L6561,u108,m6,MAX,"Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?"
3270,L6560,u114,m6,WELLES,Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
3271,L6559,u108,m6,MAX,I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
3272,L6558,u114,m6,WELLES,Truman Capote.
3273,L6557,u114,m6,WELLES,Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
3274,L6556,u108,m6,MAX,Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
3275,L6553,u114,m6,WELLES,I'll risk it.
3276,L6552,u108,m6,MAX,"It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one."
3277,L6551,u114,m6,WELLES,"Well, it's tempting, but no thanks."
3278,L6550,u108,m6,MAX,My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
3279,L6549,u114,m6,WELLES,Pardon me?
3280,L6548,u108,m6,MAX,Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
3281,L6547,u114,m6,WELLES,Yeah... guess so.
3282,L6546,u108,m6,MAX,Big date tonight?
3283,L6749,u114,m6,WELLES,"If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it."
3284,L6748,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,How will I get it to you?
3285,L6747,u114,m6,WELLES,"I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve."
3286,L6746,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,Fine...
3287,L6745,u114,m6,WELLES,"I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update."
3288,L6744,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
3289,L6743,u114,m6,WELLES,I hope it's nothing serious.
3290,L6742,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment."
3291,L6741,u114,m6,WELLES,I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
3292,L6740,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,How are you?  Having any luck?
3293,L6739,u114,m6,WELLES,"Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here."
3294,L6738,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,Hello?
3295,L6655,u114,m6,WELLES,"You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian."
3296,L6654,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"You told me to look, so I looked."
3297,L6653,u114,m6,WELLES,Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
3298,L6652,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,Okay.
3299,L6651,u114,m6,WELLES,"For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box."
3300,L6650,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,Do you think the film could have cost that much?
3301,L6649,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm here.
3302,L6648,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,Hello... ?
3303,L6647,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
3304,L6646,u114,m6,WELLES,You're joking.
3305,L6645,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars."
3306,L6644,u114,m6,WELLES,"Okay, I follow you so far..."
3307,L6643,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents..."
3308,L6642,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,The checks were for odd amounts...
3309,L6641,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm not positive this means anything.
3310,L6640,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash."
3311,L6639,u114,m6,WELLES,Okay...
3312,L6428,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her."
3313,L6427,u114,m6,WELLES,Nothing remotely like this.
3314,L6426,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,You've found missing persons before.
3315,L6425,u114,m6,WELLES,I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
3316,L6424,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her."
3317,L6423,u114,m6,WELLES,It won't work like that.
3318,L6422,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first..."
3319,L6421,u114,m6,WELLES,You don't have any other choice.
3320,L6420,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"I told you I can't, not yet."
3321,L6419,u114,m6,WELLES,You... you need to go to the police.
3322,L6418,u114,m6,WELLES,"Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about."
3323,L6417,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,Will you watch it and see for yourself?
3324,L6416,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
3325,L6415,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,I'm telling you it's not that.
3326,L6414,u114,m6,WELLES,If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
3327,L6413,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,No.
3328,L6412,u114,m6,WELLES,"Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects..."
3329,L6411,u114,m6,WELLES,"Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a ""snuff film.""  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you."
3330,L6410,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police..."
3331,L6409,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could."
3332,L6408,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm afraid I don't...
3333,L6407,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
3334,L6406,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"Cash, stock certificates, and this..."
3335,L6405,u114,m6,WELLES,Do you want to tell me what you found?
3336,L6404,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
3337,L6403,u114,m6,WELLES,You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
3338,L6402,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is."
3339,L6401,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,Just curious.
3340,L6400,u114,m6,WELLES,"I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason."
3341,L6399,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?"
3342,L6398,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply."
3343,L6397,u114,m6,WELLES,He succeeded.
3344,L6396,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary."
3345,L6395,u114,m6,WELLES,Pittsburgh?
3346,L6392,u114,m6,WELLES,I'll do whatever I can to help.
3347,L6391,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma."
3348,L6390,u114,m6,WELLES,My condolences.
3349,L6389,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now."
3350,L6388,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
3351,L6387,u114,m6,WELLES,I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
3352,L6386,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places."
3353,L6385,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here..."
3354,L6384,u114,m6,WELLES,He's odd.
3355,L6383,u114,m6,WELLES,Thank you.
3356,L6382,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,"Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?"
3357,L6373,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
3358,L6372,u114,m6,WELLES,"Uh huh, pleasure."
3359,L6369,u114,m6,WELLES,I try to be.
3360,L6368,u109,m6,MRS CHRISTIAN,Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
3361,L7098,u114,m6,WELLES,"They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time..."
3362,L7097,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
3363,L7096,u114,m6,WELLES,"They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her..."
3364,L7095,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,No... no... no...
3365,L7094,u114,m6,WELLES,He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
3366,L7093,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,No...
3367,L7092,u114,m6,WELLES,"They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her..."
3368,L7091,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,Who are you?
3369,L7090,u114,m6,WELLES,"Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her..."
3370,L7089,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,Who is this... ?
3371,L7088,u114,m6,WELLES,"Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead."
3372,L7087,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,What... ?
3373,L7086,u114,m6,WELLES,"She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress..."
3374,L7085,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,What are you talking about... ?
3375,L7084,u114,m6,WELLES,"I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true..."
3376,L7083,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,I remember.  You just left...
3377,L7082,u114,m6,WELLES,"Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter..."
3378,L7081,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,Hello... ?
3379,L6536,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,"What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know."
3380,L6535,u114,m6,WELLES,It's been six years.
3381,L6534,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,"I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her."
3382,L6532,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,Yes.
3383,L6531,u114,m6,WELLES,You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
3384,L6528,u114,m6,WELLES,"You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?"
3385,L6527,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
3386,L6526,u114,m6,WELLES,Will you let me look?
3387,L6525,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,How... how can you say that to me...?
3388,L6524,u114,m6,WELLES,"If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place."
3389,L6523,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
3390,L6522,u114,m6,WELLES,"It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something..."
3391,L6521,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,I don't know.  I think so.
3392,L6520,u114,m6,WELLES,Do you think the police did a good job?
3393,L6519,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,There wasn't one.  The police looked.
3394,L6518,u114,m6,WELLES,"It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye."
3395,L6517,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,What?
3396,L6516,u114,m6,WELLES,I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
3397,L6515,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,You should be.
3398,L6514,u114,m6,WELLES,No.
3399,L6513,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,Are you religious?
3400,L6512,u114,m6,WELLES,We're all like that.
3401,L6511,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,"Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church."
3402,L6508,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,Okay.
3403,L6507,u114,m6,WELLES,I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
3404,L6504,u114,m6,WELLES,Of course.
3405,L6503,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
3406,L6502,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
3407,L6501,u114,m6,WELLES,I had to ask.  I apologize.
3408,L6500,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,"You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either."
3409,L6499,u114,m6,WELLES,I didn't mean to...
3410,L6498,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,"There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left..."
3411,L6497,u114,m6,WELLES,"You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?"
3412,L6496,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,It got to be too much for him.
3413,L6495,u114,m6,WELLES,Why do you think he did it?
3414,L6494,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
3415,L6493,u114,m6,WELLES,"September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared."
3416,L6492,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,Yes.
3417,L6491,u114,m6,WELLES,"If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?"
3418,L6490,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,I don't know.
3419,L6489,u114,m6,WELLES,What was she running from?
3420,L6488,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
3421,L6487,u114,m6,WELLES,She just seemed... depressed... ?
3422,L6486,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,No.
3423,L6485,u114,m6,WELLES,"So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?"
3424,L6483,u114,m6,WELLES,"You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her."
3425,L6482,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,"I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV."
3426,L6481,u114,m6,WELLES,That's exactly what I am.
3427,L6480,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,"They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?"
3428,L6479,u114,m6,WELLES,"It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope."
3429,L6477,u114,m6,WELLES,"Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?"
3430,L6476,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,No.
3431,L6475,u114,m6,WELLES,"Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?"
3432,L6474,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,Neil... Neil Cole.
3433,L6473,u114,m6,WELLES,What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
3434,L6472,u114,m6,WELLES,"These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh..."
3435,L6471,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,"Yes, but..."
3436,L6470,u114,m6,WELLES,"I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?"
3437,L6469,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,"I don't understand, who are... ?"
3438,L6468,u114,m6,WELLES,"I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter."
3439,L6467,u114,m6,WELLES,"Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator..."
3440,L6466,u110,m6,MRS MATHEWS,Yes... ?
3441,L6671,u114,m6,WELLES,I'll do what I can.
3442,L6670,u111,m6,NUN,"She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?"
3443,L6669,u114,m6,WELLES,Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
3444,L6668,u111,m6,NUN,"That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture."
3445,L6667,u114,m6,WELLES,Her belongings?
3446,L6666,u111,m6,NUN,Those are her belongings.
3447,L6665,u114,m6,WELLES,What is this?
3448,L6662,u114,m6,WELLES,I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
3449,L6661,u111,m6,NUN,Do you know what happened to her?
3450,L6659,u111,m6,NUN,Yes.  I remember her.
3451,L6658,u114,m6,WELLES,"You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure..."
3452,L6657,u111,m6,NUN,Yes... I remember Mary
3453,L6360,u114,m6,WELLES,"Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance."
3454,L6359,u112,m6,POLITICIAN,"Yes, Mister Welles, thank you."
3455,L6358,u114,m6,WELLES,The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
3456,L6357,u112,m6,POLITICIAN,"He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?"
3457,L6356,u114,m6,WELLES,"No, sir, he is not."
3458,L6355,u112,m6,POLITICIAN,"None too discreet, is he?"
3459,L6354,u114,m6,WELLES,"Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize..."
3460,L6684,u113,m6,SALESPERSON,"Certainly, sir."
3461,L6683,u114,m6,WELLES,"Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you."
3462,L6682,u113,m6,SALESPERSON,"I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of..."
3463,L6681,u113,m6,SALESPERSON,Okay.  Fine.
3464,L6680,u114,m6,WELLES,"No, you may not."
3465,L6679,u113,m6,SALESPERSON,"Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?"
3466,L6678,u114,m6,WELLES,Cash.
3467,L6677,u113,m6,SALESPERSON,Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
3468,L6676,u114,m6,WELLES,"Okay, I'll take it all."
3469,L8208,u121,m7,RICK,Then we'll stay up together.
3470,L8207,u115,m7,ALICE,Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
3471,L8206,u121,m7,RICK,We'll figure it out.
3472,L8204,u121,m7,RICK,I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
3473,L8203,u115,m7,ALICE,I can't go back to sleep again.
3474,L8202,u121,m7,RICK,"Yeah, or turn you into toast."
3475,L8201,u115,m7,ALICE,"It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake."
3476,L8200,u121,m7,RICK,"Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's."
3477,L8199,u115,m7,ALICE,I can't find him.
3478,L8198,u121,m7,RICK,Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
3479,L8197,u115,m7,ALICE,It was bad.
3480,L8196,u121,m7,RICK,I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
3481,L8156,u115,m7,ALICE,Kristen...
3482,L8155,u121,m7,RICK,You alright?
3483,L8097,u115,m7,ALICE,What?
3484,L8096,u121,m7,RICK,Kincaid and Joey died last night.
3485,L8095,u115,m7,ALICE,What's wrong?
3486,L8094,u121,m7,RICK,"Alice, you think you can leave?"
3487,L8037,u121,m7,RICK,Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
3488,L8036,u115,m7,ALICE,Rick...I can't.
3489,L8035,u121,m7,RICK,"Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back."
3490,L8034,u115,m7,ALICE,But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
3491,L8033,u121,m7,RICK,Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
3492,L8032,u115,m7,ALICE,I don't want to.
3493,L8031,u121,m7,RICK,The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
3494,L8030,u115,m7,ALICE,What?
3495,L8029,u121,m7,RICK,Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
3496,L8101,u119,m7,KRISTEN,"You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't."
3497,L8100,u115,m7,ALICE,"Kristen, what happened?"
3498,L8063,u119,m7,KRISTEN,When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
3499,L8062,u115,m7,ALICE,You what?
3500,L8060,u115,m7,ALICE,"When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert."
3501,L8059,u119,m7,KRISTEN,How'd you learn so much about dreams?
3502,L8058,u115,m7,ALICE,I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
3503,L8057,u119,m7,KRISTEN,"Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?"
3504,L8056,u115,m7,ALICE,"No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up."
3505,L8055,u119,m7,KRISTEN,Sounds like a game show host to me.
3506,L8054,u115,m7,ALICE,My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
3507,L8053,u119,m7,KRISTEN,You could do worse.
3508,L8052,u115,m7,ALICE,"I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad."
3509,L8051,u119,m7,KRISTEN,"Yeah, I'm not so sure."
3510,L8050,u115,m7,ALICE,I'm sure they're around.
3511,L8049,u119,m7,KRISTEN,"Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere."
3512,L8048,u115,m7,ALICE,Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
3513,L8179,u122,m7,SHEILA,"Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look..."
3514,L8178,u115,m7,ALICE,"Then you saw him, too?"
3515,L8177,u122,m7,SHEILA,"That obvious, huh?"
3516,L8176,u115,m7,ALICE,You've been up all night?
3517,L8175,u122,m7,SHEILA,What?
3518,L8174,u115,m7,ALICE,We have matching luggage.
3519,L8173,u122,m7,SHEILA,"Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet."
3520,L8087,u115,m7,ALICE,I know.
3521,L8086,u122,m7,SHEILA,Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
3522,L8085,u115,m7,ALICE,I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
3523,L8084,u122,m7,SHEILA,I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
3524,L8083,u115,m7,ALICE,You in a hurry?
3525,L8324,u115,m7,ALICE,Save it for later.  Come on!
3526,L8323,u116,m7,DAN,You look great!
3527,L8295,u115,m7,ALICE,"Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others."
3528,L8294,u116,m7,DAN,What the hell was that?
3529,L8290,u116,m7,DAN,Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
3530,L8289,u115,m7,ALICE,Here we are.
3531,L8288,u116,m7,DAN,"You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before."
3532,L8287,u115,m7,ALICE,He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
3533,L8278,u115,m7,ALICE,"It's okay, we're just about there."
3534,L8277,u116,m7,DAN,As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
3535,L8276,u116,m7,DAN,"Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side."
3536,L8275,u115,m7,ALICE,You just feel sorry for me.
3537,L8274,u116,m7,DAN,"Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you."
3538,L8273,u115,m7,ALICE,"He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him."
3539,L8255,u116,m7,DAN,Who?
3540,L8254,u115,m7,ALICE,Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
3541,L8253,u116,m7,DAN,Then what else can we do?
3542,L8252,u115,m7,ALICE,"Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't."
3543,L8251,u116,m7,DAN,Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
3544,L8250,u115,m7,ALICE,You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
3545,L8248,u115,m7,ALICE,I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
3546,L8247,u116,m7,DAN,Is there something we can do?
3547,L8246,u115,m7,ALICE,Not really.
3548,L8218,u115,m7,ALICE,Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
3549,L8217,u116,m7,DAN,"Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?"
3550,L8216,u115,m7,ALICE,Three days.
3551,L8215,u116,m7,DAN,How long have you been awake?
3552,L8214,u115,m7,ALICE,"The story is, the deaths you can't argue with."
3553,L8213,u116,m7,DAN,"No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow."
3554,L8212,u115,m7,ALICE,"Look, you know why, you just don't believe me."
3555,L8211,u116,m7,DAN,"Extra money, huh?"
3556,L8210,u115,m7,ALICE,I've been working double shifts.
3557,L8190,u116,m7,DAN,Kristen's story really got to her.
3558,L8189,u115,m7,ALICE,"No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!"
3559,L8166,u116,m7,DAN,"""In her dream""?"
3560,L8165,u115,m7,ALICE,I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
3561,L8162,u115,m7,ALICE,"It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths."
3562,L8161,u116,m7,DAN,I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
3563,L8080,u115,m7,ALICE,I know.  Uh...Alice.
3564,L8079,u116,m7,DAN,"Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan."
3565,L8078,u115,m7,ALICE,Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
3566,L8077,u116,m7,DAN,"You're his sister, right?"
3567,L8076,u115,m7,ALICE,No...
3568,L8187,u115,m7,ALICE,I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
3569,L8186,u117,m7,DEBBIE,Enough of that crap.
3570,L8185,u115,m7,ALICE,It was Freddy.
3571,L8184,u117,m7,DEBBIE,Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
3572,L8092,u117,m7,DEBBIE,Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
3573,L8091,u115,m7,ALICE,I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
3574,L7996,u117,m7,DEBBIE,"Alright, I think I see salvation..."
3575,L7995,u115,m7,ALICE,"Rick, please."
3576,L8229,u121,m7,RICK,"What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back."
3577,L8228,u116,m7,DAN,About Freddy?
3578,L8227,u121,m7,RICK,"She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened."
3579,L8226,u116,m7,DAN,How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
3580,L8225,u121,m7,RICK,Been up with Alice.
3581,L8159,u121,m7,RICK,She knew she was gonna die.
3582,L8158,u116,m7,DAN,"Hey man, we're all sorry..."
3583,L8126,u121,m7,RICK,"Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real."
3584,L8125,u116,m7,DAN,Nice neighborhood.
3585,L8124,u121,m7,RICK,"It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive."
3586,L8123,u116,m7,DAN,So?
3587,L8122,u121,m7,RICK,She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
3588,L8121,u116,m7,DAN,So what's up?  What'd I miss?
3589,L8120,u121,m7,RICK,Let me talk to you.
3590,L8119,u116,m7,DAN,I don't get it.
3591,L8099,u121,m7,RICK,"Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment."
3592,L8098,u116,m7,DAN,"Hey, Rick!"
3593,L7994,u121,m7,RICK,Earth to Alice...
3594,L7993,u116,m7,DAN,T-T-Thanks Alice...
3595,L8143,u119,m7,KRISTEN,"Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy..."
3596,L8142,u118,m7,ELAINE,"Honey, we went over this in therapy."
3597,L8141,u119,m7,KRISTEN,"Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!"
3598,L8140,u118,m7,ELAINE,"I'm sorry honey, but..."
3599,L8138,u118,m7,ELAINE,Your distraught.  It'll help...
3600,L8137,u119,m7,KRISTEN,What's wrong with me?
3601,L8136,u118,m7,ELAINE,"You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey."
3602,L8135,u119,m7,KRISTEN,"Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite."
3603,L8134,u118,m7,ELAINE,Something the matter with the cuisine?
3604,L8118,u119,m7,KRISTEN,I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
3605,L8117,u121,m7,RICK,"It's okay, babe.  We're with you."
3606,L8116,u119,m7,KRISTEN,It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
3607,L8115,u121,m7,RICK,I'll tell you later.
3608,L8106,u119,m7,KRISTEN,It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
3609,L8105,u121,m7,RICK,I though Freddy was just an old town story.
3610,L8104,u119,m7,KRISTEN,Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
3611,L8065,u119,m7,KRISTEN,Oh God!  He killed them!
3612,L8064,u121,m7,RICK,What is it?
3613,L7984,u121,m7,RICK,"When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day."
3614,L7983,u119,m7,KRISTEN,What?
3615,L7982,u121,m7,RICK,Avoid-all-contact-day.
3616,L7981,u119,m7,KRISTEN,Something wrong with the stairs?
3617,L8072,u120,m7,NURSE,"Don't worry, honey"
3618,L8071,u119,m7,KRISTEN,"You don't get it, he's after me..."
3619,L8070,u120,m7,NURSE,You just stay put.  You need rest.
3620,L8069,u119,m7,KRISTEN,I gotta get out of here.
3621,L8068,u120,m7,NURSE,You had a nasty bump.
3622,L8067,u119,m7,KRISTEN,Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
3623,L8066,u120,m7,NURSE,Feeling better now?
3624,L8729,u123,m8,ALICE,You're not taking my baby!
3625,L8728,u129,m8,MRS. JORDAN,We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
3626,L8725,u123,m8,ALICE,"What are you talking about?  My ""condition""?..."
3627,L8724,u129,m8,MRS. JORDAN,"In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --"
3628,L8722,u129,m8,MRS. JORDAN,And ours.  It's our grandchild.
3629,L8721,u123,m8,ALICE,"Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility."
3630,L8718,u123,m8,ALICE,"What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him."
3631,L8717,u129,m8,MRS. JORDAN,"Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?"
3632,L8420,u123,m8,ALICE,"It's okay, Dan"
3633,L8419,u129,m8,MRS. JORDAN,"Excuse us, dear."
3634,L8806,u127,m8,JACOB,He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
3635,L8805,u123,m8,ALICE,But how...?
3636,L8804,u127,m8,JACOB,It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
3637,L8803,u123,m8,ALICE,What do you mean?
3638,L8802,u127,m8,JACOB,"He's inside you, where he hides."
3639,L8801,u123,m8,ALICE,Where is he?
3640,L8793,u123,m8,ALICE,Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
3641,L8792,u127,m8,JACOB,Mommy...?
3642,L8657,u127,m8,JACOB,"My friend, with the funny hand."
3643,L8656,u123,m8,ALICE,Who says I don't like you?
3644,L8654,u123,m8,ALICE,"Who said I...wait, what?"
3645,L8653,u127,m8,JACOB,No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
3646,L8652,u123,m8,ALICE,Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
3647,L8651,u127,m8,JACOB,She doesn't want me around
3648,L8650,u123,m8,ALICE,I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
3649,L8649,u127,m8,JACOB,No...
3650,L8648,u123,m8,ALICE,Is that who you're waiting for?
3651,L8645,u127,m8,JACOB,Been having bad dreams.
3652,L8644,u123,m8,ALICE,"Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?"
3653,L8543,u127,m8,JACOB,I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
3654,L8542,u123,m8,ALICE,How did you know that?
3655,L8541,u127,m8,JACOB,I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
3656,L8540,u123,m8,ALICE,My name is...
3657,L8539,u127,m8,JACOB,"It's lonely in there, in my room."
3658,L8538,u123,m8,ALICE,"Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?"
3659,L8536,u123,m8,ALICE,Huh?
3660,L8535,u127,m8,JACOB,Hey...wake up.
3661,L8414,u123,m8,ALICE,Me too.
3662,L8413,u125,m8,DAN,There you go.  Love you.
3663,L8412,u123,m8,ALICE,You're right.
3664,L8411,u125,m8,DAN,"You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember..."
3665,L8410,u123,m8,ALICE,Yeah...I guess.
3666,L8409,u125,m8,DAN,You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
3667,L8408,u123,m8,ALICE,"No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared."
3668,L8407,u125,m8,DAN,About him?
3669,L8405,u125,m8,DAN,"He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?"
3670,L8404,u123,m8,ALICE,Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
3671,L8403,u125,m8,DAN,"Okay, babe.  What's the matter?"
3672,L8402,u123,m8,ALICE,I know.
3673,L8401,u125,m8,DAN,"They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!"
3674,L8400,u123,m8,ALICE,The tickets.
3675,L8397,u125,m8,DAN,"Sorry, babe."
3676,L8396,u123,m8,ALICE,Jesus!  Don't do that!
3677,L8395,u125,m8,DAN,"Hi, beautiful."
3678,L8783,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,Now.
3679,L8782,u123,m8,ALICE,But Dad --
3680,L8781,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
3681,L8780,u123,m8,ALICE,I've got to go.
3682,L8779,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,Alice!
3683,L8580,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,"No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again."
3684,L8579,u123,m8,ALICE,You disappointed in me?
3685,L8578,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,Since my little girl became a mom...
3686,L8577,u123,m8,ALICE,Since when are you such a smart shopper?
3687,L8576,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,Alice...
3688,L8575,u123,m8,ALICE,Very funny.
3689,L8574,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,Sobering...
3690,L8573,u123,m8,ALICE,How was the meeting?
3691,L8525,u123,m8,ALICE,"Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand."
3692,L8524,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,"I'm so sorry, honey..."
3693,L8451,u123,m8,ALICE,It's just across the park.
3694,L8450,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,You sure you don't want a ride to work?
3695,L8449,u123,m8,ALICE,"Thanks for everything, Dad."
3696,L8447,u123,m8,ALICE,To take a picture.
3697,L8446,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,Where are we going?
3698,L8444,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
3699,L8443,u123,m8,ALICE,Dad!
3700,L8442,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,No.  A deal's a deal.
3701,L8441,u123,m8,ALICE,That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
3702,L8440,u124,m8,ALICE'S DAD,"I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing..."
3703,L8439,u123,m8,ALICE,I was afraid you weren't coming.
3704,L8819,u123,m8,ALICE,That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
3705,L8818,u130,m8,YVONNE,He sure loves to stay awake.
3706,L8817,u123,m8,ALICE,So did Dan.
3707,L8816,u130,m8,YVONNE,"You do good work, Alice."
3708,L8778,u123,m8,ALICE,We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
3709,L8777,u130,m8,YVONNE,But how are we gonna --
3710,L8776,u123,m8,ALICE,Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
3711,L8775,u130,m8,YVONNE,What?
3712,L8770,u123,m8,ALICE,If they actually bothered to bury her.
3713,L8769,u130,m8,YVONNE,You think that's the place she's buried?
3714,L8760,u130,m8,YVONNE,Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
3715,L8759,u123,m8,ALICE,Are you alright?
3716,L8705,u123,m8,ALICE,That's the only reason you're alive...
3717,L8704,u130,m8,YVONNE,Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
3718,L8700,u123,m8,ALICE,"Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams."
3719,L8699,u130,m8,YVONNE,All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
3720,L8698,u123,m8,ALICE,"What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??"
3721,L8697,u130,m8,YVONNE,And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
3722,L8696,u123,m8,ALICE,Krueger is reality.
3723,L8695,u130,m8,YVONNE,"I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality."
3724,L8677,u123,m8,ALICE,I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
3725,L8676,u130,m8,YVONNE,"I really think you need to calm down now, okay?"
3726,L8675,u123,m8,ALICE,Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
3727,L8674,u130,m8,YVONNE,"Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself..."
3728,L8673,u123,m8,ALICE,I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
3729,L8672,u130,m8,YVONNE,You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
3730,L8621,u130,m8,YVONNE,Why don't you two stick to reality.
3731,L8620,u123,m8,ALICE,"I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?"
3732,L8614,u123,m8,ALICE,No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
3733,L8613,u130,m8,YVONNE,It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
3734,L8565,u130,m8,YVONNE,When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
3735,L8564,u123,m8,ALICE,What's that got to do with it?
3736,L8552,u130,m8,YVONNE,They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
3737,L8551,u123,m8,ALICE,Did everyone call everyone?
3738,L8547,u123,m8,ALICE,He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
3739,L8546,u130,m8,YVONNE,There aren't any little boys on your floor.
3740,L8545,u123,m8,ALICE,"Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?"
3741,L8523,u130,m8,YVONNE,"Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead."
3742,L8522,u123,m8,ALICE,"It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way."
3743,L8394,u130,m8,YVONNE,"Yeah, before they revoke his diploma."
3744,L8393,u123,m8,ALICE,"Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan."
3745,L8365,u123,m8,ALICE,"No, the Dan part was nice..."
3746,L8364,u130,m8,YVONNE,"Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl."
3747,L8363,u123,m8,ALICE,Had kind of a long night.
3748,L8362,u130,m8,YVONNE,"Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile."
3749,L8743,u128,m8,MARK,She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
3750,L8742,u123,m8,ALICE,I don't understand.
3751,L8741,u128,m8,MARK,No shit.
3752,L8740,u123,m8,ALICE,Poor woman...
3753,L8739,u128,m8,MARK,"Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?"
3754,L8738,u123,m8,ALICE,But I've seen her grave.
3755,L8737,u128,m8,MARK,They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
3756,L8736,u123,m8,ALICE,Meaning?
3757,L8735,u128,m8,MARK,"That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought."
3758,L8734,u123,m8,ALICE,"No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?"
3759,L8733,u128,m8,MARK,That's their problem.
3760,L8732,u123,m8,ALICE,They think I'm nuts.
3761,L8711,u128,m8,MARK,Then we'll find another way.
3762,L8710,u123,m8,ALICE,"I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him."
3763,L8671,u128,m8,MARK,I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
3764,L8670,u123,m8,ALICE,Where are you going?
3765,L8668,u123,m8,ALICE,I don't know!
3766,L8667,u128,m8,MARK,"Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?"
3767,L8665,u128,m8,MARK,"What, you named it already?"
3768,L8664,u123,m8,ALICE,My baby!
3769,L8663,u128,m8,MARK,Who's Jacob?
3770,L8640,u123,m8,ALICE,Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
3771,L8639,u128,m8,MARK,Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
3772,L8638,u123,m8,ALICE,It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
3773,L8637,u128,m8,MARK,"Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit."
3774,L8634,u123,m8,ALICE,Nobody thinks that.
3775,L8633,u128,m8,MARK,Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
3776,L8627,u123,m8,ALICE,Mark!
3777,L8626,u128,m8,MARK,Then get out!
3778,L8617,u123,m8,ALICE,She must've fallen asleep at the table...
3779,L8616,u128,m8,MARK,I thought about that.
3780,L8612,u128,m8,MARK,"I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?"
3781,L8611,u123,m8,ALICE,I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
3782,L8610,u128,m8,MARK,Yeah.  I'm just aces.
3783,L8609,u123,m8,ALICE,"Mark, are you okay?"
3784,L8557,u123,m8,ALICE,That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
3785,L8556,u128,m8,MARK,I've got to write some of this down.
3786,L8424,u128,m8,MARK,Well we gotta do something!
3787,L8423,u123,m8,ALICE,My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
3788,L8383,u128,m8,MARK,"Greta, come on.  One burger with me?"
3789,L8382,u123,m8,ALICE,Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
3790,L8377,u128,m8,MARK,I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
3791,L8376,u123,m8,ALICE,"Give up, Mark, it's hopeless."
3792,L8495,u126,m8,GRETA,I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
3793,L8494,u128,m8,MARK,Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
3794,L8490,u128,m8,MARK,"Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should."
3795,L8489,u126,m8,GRETA,Who?
3796,L8488,u128,m8,MARK,He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
3797,L8422,u126,m8,GRETA,You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
3798,L8421,u128,m8,MARK,"That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place."
3799,L8381,u126,m8,GRETA,"Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career."
3800,L8380,u128,m8,MARK,Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
3801,L8375,u128,m8,MARK,My undying love.  Have some.
3802,L8374,u126,m8,GRETA,"Next life.  Oh, what's that?"
3803,L8373,u128,m8,MARK,"Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?"
3804,L8571,u130,m8,YVONNE,All of us.  Right?
3805,L8570,u126,m8,GRETA,"Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first."
3806,L8563,u126,m8,GRETA,Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
3807,L8562,u130,m8,YVONNE,Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
3808,L8559,u126,m8,GRETA,I want to talk about the baby.
3809,L8558,u130,m8,YVONNE,"Stop saying that, it's bullshit."
3810,L8484,u126,m8,GRETA,"Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night."
3811,L8483,u130,m8,YVONNE,"Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?"
3812,L8482,u126,m8,GRETA,"Have another one, sounds like you need it."
3813,L8427,u130,m8,YVONNE,That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
3814,L8426,u126,m8,GRETA,Yeah...
3815,L8425,u130,m8,YVONNE,"All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today..."
3816,L8367,u130,m8,YVONNE,Makes you look like a nun--
3817,L8366,u126,m8,GRETA,These things are wild...  What do you think?
3818,L8703,u128,m8,MARK,He invited me to his house last night.
3819,L8702,u130,m8,YVONNE,"You, too?"
3820,L8630,u128,m8,MARK,"Stick around, please?"
3821,L8629,u130,m8,YVONNE,It's okay.
3822,L8625,u130,m8,YVONNE,I can't listen to this.
3823,L8624,u128,m8,MARK,"I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!"
3824,L8623,u130,m8,YVONNE,Mark...
3825,L8622,u128,m8,MARK,"Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!"
3826,L8499,u128,m8,MARK,Faint.
3827,L8498,u130,m8,YVONNE,Vomit?
3828,L8481,u130,m8,YVONNE,"Two hours a day, six days a week."
3829,L8480,u128,m8,MARK,Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
3830,L55857,u135,m9,REEF,"And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?"
3831,L55856,u131,m9,CARL,"I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -"
3832,L55855,u135,m9,REEF,I don't know.
3833,L55854,u131,m9,CARL,But if they <u>do</u>?
3834,L55853,u135,m9,REEF,"Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all."
3835,L55852,u131,m9,CARL,Which is the one - we have to worry about?
3836,L55851,u135,m9,REEF,Yes?
3837,L55850,u131,m9,CARL,"They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -"
3838,L55668,u135,m9,REEF,I'd sooner swim!
3839,L55667,u131,m9,CARL,"However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -"
3840,L55666,u135,m9,REEF,- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
3841,L55665,u131,m9,CARL,"That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !"
3842,L55538,u135,m9,REEF,Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
3843,L55537,u131,m9,CARL,Unidentified Flying Objects.
3844,L55458,u135,m9,REEF,"You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!"
3845,L55457,u131,m9,CARL,"Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!"
3846,L55456,u135,m9,REEF,You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
3847,L55455,u131,m9,CARL,Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
3848,L55454,u135,m9,REEF,"You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?"
3849,L55453,u131,m9,CARL,"That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!"
3850,L55452,u135,m9,REEF,We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
3851,L55451,u131,m9,CARL,"Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life..."
3852,L55450,u135,m9,REEF,<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
3853,L55449,u131,m9,CARL,"You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!"
3854,L55448,u135,m9,REEF,"Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome..."
3855,L55447,u131,m9,CARL,What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
3856,L55446,u135,m9,REEF,"Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital."
3857,L55445,u131,m9,CARL,My father!  He's not - ?
3858,L55444,u135,m9,REEF,Your 'out.'  This came for you.
3859,L55443,u131,m9,CARL,What is it?
3860,L55390,u131,m9,CARL,Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
3861,L55389,u135,m9,REEF,You could train someone else.
3862,L55387,u135,m9,REEF,And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
3863,L55386,u131,m9,CARL,"It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along."
3864,L55385,u135,m9,REEF,How is he - ?
3865,L55384,u131,m9,CARL,"It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago."
3866,L55383,u135,m9,REEF,"I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father."
3867,L55792,u132,m9,DAVE,"What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?"
3868,L55791,u135,m9,REEF,Dave - !
3869,L55770,u132,m9,DAVE,Oh it does???
3870,L55769,u135,m9,REEF,Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
3871,L55762,u132,m9,DAVE,I'm with <u>you!</u>
3872,L55761,u135,m9,REEF,Well?
3873,L55759,u135,m9,REEF,We'll have to look for them later.
3874,L55758,u132,m9,DAVE,Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
3875,L55757,u135,m9,REEF,Somewhere down there?
3876,L55756,u132,m9,DAVE,Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
3877,L55749,u132,m9,DAVE,The sound again?
3878,L55748,u135,m9,REEF,You hear that?
3879,L55735,u135,m9,REEF,"Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon."
3880,L55734,u132,m9,DAVE,And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
3881,L55733,u135,m9,REEF,You know - it <u>is</u>?
3882,L55732,u132,m9,DAVE,Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
3883,L55729,u135,m9,REEF,Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
3884,L55728,u132,m9,DAVE,I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
3885,L55727,u135,m9,REEF,Listen!  Hear that?
3886,L55726,u132,m9,DAVE,Yeah?
3887,L55699,u135,m9,REEF,Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
3888,L55698,u132,m9,DAVE,I think you're right.
3889,L55697,u135,m9,REEF,"What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!"
3890,L55696,u132,m9,DAVE,"How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up."
3891,L55689,u132,m9,DAVE,"Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!"
3892,L55688,u135,m9,REEF,"You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look."
3893,L55662,u132,m9,DAVE,"Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---"
3894,L55661,u135,m9,REEF,'Us?'
3895,L55660,u132,m9,DAVE,"You've got to let us try, Skipper --"
3896,L55644,u132,m9,DAVE,Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
3897,L55643,u135,m9,REEF,We're stuck tight!
3898,L55571,u132,m9,DAVE,"Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing."
3899,L55570,u135,m9,REEF,Cyclops?
3900,L55436,u135,m9,REEF,"'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!"
3901,L55435,u132,m9,DAVE,Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
3902,L55434,u135,m9,REEF,"But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same."
3903,L55433,u132,m9,DAVE,A lot of people think like that.
3904,L55432,u135,m9,REEF,"So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'"
3905,L55431,u132,m9,DAVE,So?
3906,L55430,u135,m9,REEF,"One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs."
3907,L55429,u132,m9,DAVE,I guess.
3908,L55428,u135,m9,REEF,"I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?"
3909,L55426,u135,m9,REEF,I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
3910,L55425,u132,m9,DAVE,Huh?
3911,L55424,u135,m9,REEF,You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
3912,L55355,u135,m9,REEF,Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
3913,L55354,u132,m9,DAVE,What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
3914,L55353,u135,m9,REEF,<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
3915,L55352,u132,m9,DAVE,At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
3916,L55351,u135,m9,REEF,"So they caught up with you, too?"
3917,L55350,u132,m9,DAVE,Reef!
3918,L55323,u135,m9,REEF,Helen.  I appeal to you -
3919,L55322,u132,m9,DAVE,"But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!"
3920,L55321,u135,m9,REEF,"Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -"
3921,L55674,u138,m9,WENDOVER,We hope!
3922,L55673,u132,m9,DAVE,Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
3923,L55672,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --"
3924,L55671,u132,m9,DAVE,The frogmen?
3925,L55670,u138,m9,WENDOVER,You better take Powell and Carney with you --
3926,L55627,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Right at our one-eyed friend!
3927,L55626,u132,m9,DAVE,"What course, Skipper?"
3928,L55622,u138,m9,WENDOVER,What???
3929,L55621,u132,m9,DAVE,"A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!"
3930,L55522,u132,m9,DAVE,Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
3931,L55521,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Course and speed?
3932,L55471,u132,m9,DAVE,I...don't know!
3933,L55470,u138,m9,WENDOVER,What about down?
3934,L55469,u132,m9,DAVE,Seems to be all around...
3935,L55468,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Is there any way out of it?
3936,L55380,u132,m9,DAVE,"Right, Skipper."
3937,L55379,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
3938,L55714,u138,m9,WENDOVER,What????
3939,L55713,u133,m9,GRIFF,We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
3940,L55712,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Why do you say that?
3941,L55711,u133,m9,GRIFF,The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
3942,L55710,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Something wrong?
3943,L55709,u133,m9,GRIFF,Skipper - could you take a look here...?
3944,L55546,u133,m9,GRIFF,"All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor."
3945,L55545,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"Yes, Griff?"
3946,L55544,u133,m9,GRIFF,"Excuse me, Skipper---"
3947,L55827,u138,m9,WENDOVER,What about time...?
3948,L55826,u134,m9,KENT,It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
3949,L55825,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Anything ---
3950,L55824,u134,m9,KENT,"Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot..."
3951,L55741,u134,m9,KENT,Radiation level...constantly rising...
3952,L55740,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Now they feel it...down below.
3953,L55705,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!"
3954,L55704,u134,m9,KENT,Wonderful!
3955,L55703,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!"
3956,L55833,u134,m9,KENT,As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
3957,L55832,u137,m9,SIR IAN,All ready?
3958,L55744,u137,m9,SIR IAN,There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
3959,L55743,u134,m9,KENT,There's got to be an explanation!
3960,L55742,u137,m9,SIR IAN,As we near the Pole...
3961,L55717,u137,m9,SIR IAN,What direction does the system indicate?
3962,L55716,u134,m9,KENT,The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
3963,L55564,u134,m9,KENT,If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
3964,L55563,u137,m9,SIR IAN,"....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?"
3965,L55559,u134,m9,KENT,The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
3966,L55558,u137,m9,SIR IAN,<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
3967,L55557,u134,m9,KENT,We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
3968,L55496,u137,m9,SIR IAN,What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
3969,L55495,u134,m9,KENT,Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
3970,L55494,u137,m9,SIR IAN,"...above Murmansk, and Finland."
3971,L55467,u134,m9,KENT,"High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions..."
3972,L55466,u137,m9,SIR IAN,Under <u>water</u>?
3973,L55465,u134,m9,KENT,"It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?"
3974,L55838,u135,m9,REEF,Minus three.
3975,L55837,u138,m9,WENDOVER,What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
3976,L55823,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"Nothing we can do, now."
3977,L55822,u135,m9,REEF,Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
3978,L55654,u135,m9,REEF,If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
3979,L55653,u138,m9,WENDOVER,What?
3980,L55652,u135,m9,REEF,"Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?"
3981,L55647,u138,m9,WENDOVER,And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
3982,L55646,u135,m9,REEF,"It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom."
3983,L55645,u138,m9,WENDOVER,A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
3984,L55631,u138,m9,WENDOVER,We can <u>ram</u> him!
3985,L55630,u135,m9,REEF,But - what can we accomplish?
3986,L55629,u138,m9,WENDOVER,That's what I said!
3987,L55628,u135,m9,REEF,Right <u>at</u> him?
3988,L55615,u135,m9,REEF,Thirty-four seconds!
3989,L55614,u138,m9,WENDOVER,What's the running time?
3990,L55597,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Take a look.
3991,L55596,u135,m9,REEF,You're sure it's Cyclops?
3992,L55514,u135,m9,REEF,After torpedo room:  Report!
3993,L55513,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"Determine extent of damage, immediately."
3994,L55418,u135,m9,REEF,I think I should have joined the Air Force!
3995,L55417,u138,m9,WENDOVER,What do you think?
3996,L55378,u135,m9,REEF,It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
3997,L55377,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Huh?
3998,L55376,u135,m9,REEF,'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
3999,L55375,u138,m9,WENDOVER,Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
4000,L55374,u135,m9,REEF,Who with?
4001,L55373,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip."
4002,L55361,u135,m9,REEF,"I met Dr. Kent, once."
4003,L55360,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway."
4004,L55359,u135,m9,REEF,"Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper."
4005,L55808,u135,m9,REEF,<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
4006,L55807,u136,m9,SAUCER VOICE,Obviously.
4007,L55806,u135,m9,REEF,"To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?"
4008,L55805,u136,m9,SAUCER VOICE,Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
4009,L55804,u135,m9,REEF,That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
4010,L55803,u136,m9,SAUCER VOICE,It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
4011,L55799,u136,m9,SAUCER VOICE,"I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'"
4012,L55798,u135,m9,REEF,Why?
4013,L55797,u136,m9,SAUCER VOICE,On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
4014,L55796,u135,m9,REEF,Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
4015,L55790,u136,m9,SAUCER VOICE,I am afraid not.  Therefore -
4016,L55789,u135,m9,REEF,He did!
4017,L55788,u136,m9,SAUCER VOICE,Your friend was to remain where he was!
4018,L55787,u135,m9,REEF,Swell!
4019,L55785,u135,m9,REEF,- for horrors like yourself?
4020,L55784,u136,m9,SAUCER VOICE,"My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -"
4021,L55777,u135,m9,REEF,"Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?"
4022,L55776,u136,m9,SAUCER VOICE,"Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you."
4023,L55775,u135,m9,REEF,That's a <u>face</u>???
4024,L55765,u135,m9,REEF,Come where?
4025,L55764,u136,m9,SAUCER VOICE,"Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!"
4026,L55829,u138,m9,WENDOVER,All right - go to it.
4027,L55828,u137,m9,SIR IAN,Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
4028,L55719,u137,m9,SIR IAN,Toward the Pole!
4029,L55718,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"Due north.  At five knots...no, six!"
4030,L55555,u138,m9,WENDOVER,But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
4031,L55554,u137,m9,SIR IAN,We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
4032,L55549,u137,m9,SIR IAN,"Or, perhaps, until he gets us?"
4033,L55548,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!"
4034,L55532,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!"
4035,L55531,u137,m9,SIR IAN,"Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus."
4036,L55519,u137,m9,SIR IAN,I'll be another!
4037,L55518,u138,m9,WENDOVER,"Well, I'll be - !"
4038,L55482,u137,m9,SIR IAN,The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
4039,L55481,u138,m9,WENDOVER,See what?
4040,L55367,u137,m9,SIR IAN,Thank you.
4041,L55366,u138,m9,WENDOVER,My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
4042,L12762,u139,m10,ALMA,"All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town."
4043,L12761,u154,m10,WADE,He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
4044,L12760,u139,m10,ALMA,No.
4045,L12759,u154,m10,WADE,Twombley involved?
4046,L12758,u139,m10,ALMA,"I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league."
4047,L12757,u154,m10,WADE,What is the Northcountry Development Association?
4048,L12756,u139,m10,ALMA,"This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?"
4049,L12754,u154,m10,WADE,"As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere."
4050,L12753,u139,m10,ALMA,Has anybody offered to buy it?
4051,L12752,u154,m10,WADE,I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
4052,L12751,u139,m10,ALMA,About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
4053,L12750,u154,m10,WADE,You don't believe me?
4054,L12749,u139,m10,ALMA,Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
4055,L12748,u154,m10,WADE,"...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age."
4056,L12747,u154,m10,WADE,"You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?"
4057,L12746,u139,m10,ALMA,Who?
4058,L12745,u154,m10,WADE,"Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him."
4059,L12744,u139,m10,ALMA,Who?
4060,L12743,u154,m10,WADE,"This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things."
4061,L12742,u139,m10,ALMA,Always has been.
4062,L12741,u154,m10,WADE,"Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town."
4063,L12740,u139,m10,ALMA,"Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral."
4064,L12739,u154,m10,WADE,"Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay."
4065,L12738,u139,m10,ALMA,"Are you alright, Wade?"
4066,L12737,u154,m10,WADE,No. Black.
4067,L12736,u139,m10,ALMA,Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
4068,L12735,u154,m10,WADE,"You got yourself a computer, Alma."
4069,L12780,u140,m10,CHICK,He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
4070,L12779,u154,m10,WADE,He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
4071,L12778,u140,m10,CHICK,Chub says you're fired.
4072,L12777,u154,m10,WADE,Tell me.
4073,L12776,u140,m10,CHICK,LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
4074,L12775,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah. I know about that.
4075,L12774,u140,m10,CHICK,"-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade."
4076,L12773,u154,m10,WADE,Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
4077,L12772,u140,m10,CHICK,The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
4078,L12141,u140,m10,CHICK,Same old shit.
4079,L12140,u154,m10,WADE,What are you boys up to?
4080,L12680,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
4081,L12679,u141,m10,HAND,You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
4082,L12678,u154,m10,WADE,Oh.
4083,L12677,u141,m10,HAND,"Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred."
4084,L12676,u154,m10,WADE,Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
4085,L12675,u141,m10,HAND,Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
4086,L12674,u154,m10,WADE,Yes.
4087,L12673,u141,m10,HAND,"No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?"
4088,L12672,u154,m10,WADE,"It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?"
4089,L12671,u141,m10,HAND,Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
4090,L12670,u154,m10,WADE,This spring.
4091,L12669,u141,m10,HAND,How soon?
4092,L12668,u154,m10,WADE,I plan to. Soon.
4093,L12667,u141,m10,HAND,"It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work."
4094,L12666,u154,m10,WADE,I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
4095,L12733,u142,m10,JACK,That was me.
4096,L12732,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,We bought you.
4097,L12731,u142,m10,JACK,You can't buy Wade off.
4098,L12730,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
4099,L12729,u142,m10,JACK,Shit! What are we gonna do?
4100,L12728,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,He's on to us!
4101,L12402,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"No, of course not. Just say it, that's all."
4102,L12401,u142,m10,JACK,"Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?"
4103,L12400,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment."
4104,L12399,u142,m10,JACK,"Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me."
4105,L12398,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?"
4106,L12390,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?"
4107,L12389,u142,m10,JACK,"Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in."
4108,L12388,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,You see it?
4109,L12381,u142,m10,JACK,Yeah.
4110,L12380,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,I hear Twombley got shot.
4111,L12379,u142,m10,JACK,You heard the news.
4112,L12300,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
4113,L12299,u142,m10,JACK,"Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around."
4114,L12284,u142,m10,JACK,Deers have ears too.
4115,L12283,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,Sun's gettin high.
4116,L12282,u142,m10,JACK,This way.
4117,L12281,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,Yeah.
4118,L12280,u142,m10,JACK,Safety on?
4119,L12278,u142,m10,JACK,"Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm."
4120,L12277,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,What happened?
4121,L12276,u142,m10,JACK,"The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck."
4122,L12275,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,Hmm.
4123,L12274,u142,m10,JACK,They said.
4124,L12273,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,Really.
4125,L12272,u142,m10,JACK,"Pitcher. ""Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."""
4126,L12271,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,Oh.
4127,L12270,u142,m10,JACK,Double A. New Britain.
4128,L12269,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,You played for the Sox?
4129,L12268,u142,m10,JACK,Drafted by the Red Sox.
4130,L12267,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,Yeah?
4131,L12266,u142,m10,JACK,I used to play ball.
4132,L12265,u142,m10,JACK,Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
4133,L12264,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,I'm okay.
4134,L12254,u142,m10,JACK,Wonderful!
4135,L12253,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
4136,L12252,u142,m10,JACK,I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
4137,L12251,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,"You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck."
4138,L12250,u142,m10,JACK,Mmm.
4139,L12249,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,"You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine."
4140,L12248,u142,m10,JACK,"You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it."
4141,L12247,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,You think so.
4142,L12246,u142,m10,JACK,You might not kill it.
4143,L12245,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,Yeah.
4144,L12244,u142,m10,JACK,If you get it?
4145,L12243,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,"Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it."
4146,L12242,u142,m10,JACK,Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
4147,L12241,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,Damn straight!
4148,L12240,u142,m10,JACK,"Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?"
4149,L12239,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,"Guaranteed, eh?"
4150,L12238,u142,m10,JACK,"Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten."
4151,L12237,u153,m10,TWOMBLEY,"It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid."
4152,L12661,u142,m10,JACK,What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
4153,L12660,u154,m10,WADE,"I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow."
4154,L12659,u142,m10,JACK,Open the door. We're late.
4155,L12658,u154,m10,WADE,"Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?"
4156,L12657,u142,m10,JACK,"Open the door, will ya?"
4157,L12656,u142,m10,JACK,Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
4158,L12655,u154,m10,WADE,Lawford?
4159,L12654,u142,m10,JACK,I'm fucking out of here.
4160,L12428,u142,m10,JACK,He sure as hell won't.
4161,L12427,u154,m10,WADE,Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
4162,L12426,u142,m10,JACK,Yeah.
4163,L12425,u154,m10,WADE,"There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right."
4164,L12424,u142,m10,JACK,"Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man."
4165,L12423,u154,m10,WADE,You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
4166,L12422,u142,m10,JACK,"What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that."
4167,L12421,u154,m10,WADE,Saw him do it?
4168,L12420,u142,m10,JACK,What?
4169,L12419,u154,m10,WADE,Sure you did.
4170,L12418,u142,m10,JACK,"Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said."
4171,L12417,u154,m10,WADE,I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
4172,L12416,u142,m10,JACK,Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
4173,L12415,u154,m10,WADE,"I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?"
4174,L12414,u142,m10,JACK,"Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?"
4175,L12413,u154,m10,WADE,On your sleeve.
4176,L12412,u142,m10,JACK,What blood?
4177,L12411,u154,m10,WADE,Where'd you get the blood?
4178,L12410,u142,m10,JACK,Yeah.
4179,L12409,u154,m10,WADE,You stayed away?
4180,L12408,u142,m10,JACK,The ambulance guys lugged him up.
4181,L12407,u154,m10,WADE,You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
4182,L12406,u142,m10,JACK,"A half mile in, along the old lumber road."
4183,L12405,u154,m10,WADE,"No, I mean whereabouts."
4184,L12404,u142,m10,JACK,In the chest.
4185,L12403,u154,m10,WADE,Where'd Twombley get shot?
4186,L12204,u142,m10,JACK,Piece of fucking cake.
4187,L12203,u154,m10,WADE,"Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?"
4188,L12198,u154,m10,WADE,Shit.
4189,L12197,u142,m10,JACK,Bastard's got his high beams on.
4190,L12196,u154,m10,WADE,Right!
4191,L12195,u142,m10,JACK,"Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him."
4192,L12194,u154,m10,WADE,Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
4193,L12193,u142,m10,JACK,Like you and Gordon?
4194,L12190,u142,m10,JACK,"Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy."
4195,L12189,u154,m10,WADE,How'd you get the job?
4196,L12188,u142,m10,JACK,"Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there."
4197,L12187,u154,m10,WADE,Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
4198,L12186,u142,m10,JACK,"Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --"
4199,L12184,u154,m10,WADE,Not here.
4200,L12183,u142,m10,JACK,"Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems."
4201,L12182,u154,m10,WADE,You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
4202,L12181,u142,m10,JACK,"Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?"
4203,L12180,u154,m10,WADE,I thought I told you to move that truck!
4204,L12150,u154,m10,WADE,"Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?"
4205,L12149,u142,m10,JACK,No brag. Just fact.
4206,L12148,u154,m10,WADE,Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
4207,L12147,u142,m10,JACK,LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
4208,L12146,u154,m10,WADE,Don't mind if I do.
4209,L12835,u154,m10,WADE,"Okay, let's go home, then."
4210,L12834,u143,m10,JILL,I want to go home.
4211,L12833,u154,m10,WADE,"Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened."
4212,L12830,u143,m10,JILL,Oh.
4213,L12829,u154,m10,WADE,Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
4214,L12828,u143,m10,JILL,You're a policeman.
4215,L12827,u154,m10,WADE,I know.
4216,L12826,u143,m10,JILL,"That's illegal, you know."
4217,L12825,u154,m10,WADE,You can't.
4218,L12824,u143,m10,JILL,I want to go home.
4219,L12823,u154,m10,WADE,"I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to."
4220,L12822,u143,m10,JILL,What are you sorry for?
4221,L12821,u154,m10,WADE,"Please don't cry. Please, honey."
4222,L12819,u154,m10,WADE,Fine.
4223,L12818,u143,m10,JILL,Okay.
4224,L12817,u154,m10,WADE,"Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's."
4225,L12816,u143,m10,JILL,Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
4226,L12815,u154,m10,WADE,"I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though."
4227,L12814,u143,m10,JILL,"Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --"
4228,L12813,u154,m10,WADE,"You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?"
4229,L12812,u143,m10,JILL,Nothing.
4230,L12811,u154,m10,WADE,"What do you want, then?"
4231,L12810,u143,m10,JILL,No.
4232,L12809,u154,m10,WADE,"C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?"
4233,L12808,u143,m10,JILL,Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
4234,L12807,u154,m10,WADE,How about a Big Mac?
4235,L12806,u143,m10,JILL,Oh.
4236,L12805,u154,m10,WADE,Grandpa. My father. It's his.
4237,L12804,u143,m10,JILL,Pop?
4238,L12803,u154,m10,WADE,It belongs to Pop.
4239,L12802,u143,m10,JILL,It's pretty old.
4240,L12801,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
4241,L12800,u143,m10,JILL,Are we going in this?
4242,L12598,u154,m10,WADE,I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
4243,L12597,u143,m10,JILL,Dad.
4244,L12179,u143,m10,JILL,"That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here."
4245,L12178,u154,m10,WADE,Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
4246,L12177,u154,m10,WADE,Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
4247,L12176,u143,m10,JILL,Yes.
4248,L12175,u154,m10,WADE,She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
4249,L12174,u143,m10,JILL,Yes.
4250,L12173,u154,m10,WADE,"That's all you got to say? ""Yes""."
4251,L12172,u143,m10,JILL,Yes.
4252,L12171,u154,m10,WADE,She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
4253,L12170,u154,m10,WADE,"Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves."
4254,L12169,u143,m10,JILL,"I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me."
4255,L12168,u154,m10,WADE,"Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?"
4256,L12167,u143,m10,JILL,"See, I knew you'd be mad."
4257,L12166,u154,m10,WADE,Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
4258,L12165,u143,m10,JILL,I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
4259,L12164,u154,m10,WADE,"Jesus, why?"
4260,L12163,u143,m10,JILL,Yes.
4261,L12162,u154,m10,WADE,What? You called Mommy? Just now?
4262,L12161,u143,m10,JILL,I called Mommy.
4263,L12160,u154,m10,WADE,"Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something."
4264,L12159,u143,m10,JILL,"I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home."
4265,L12158,u154,m10,WADE,You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
4266,L12157,u143,m10,JILL,No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
4267,L12156,u154,m10,WADE,No what?
4268,L12155,u143,m10,JILL,No.
4269,L12154,u154,m10,WADE,"Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day."
4270,L12138,u154,m10,WADE,"Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam."
4271,L12137,u143,m10,JILL,I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
4272,L12136,u154,m10,WADE,It's fun.
4273,L12135,u143,m10,JILL,It's stupid.
4274,L12134,u154,m10,WADE,What then?
4275,L12133,u143,m10,JILL,It's not that.
4276,L12132,u154,m10,WADE,Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
4277,L12131,u143,m10,JILL,I don't want to.
4278,L12130,u154,m10,WADE,"Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know."
4279,L12127,u143,m10,JILL,No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
4280,L12126,u154,m10,WADE,No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
4281,L12125,u143,m10,JILL,I just think you used to be bad.
4282,L12124,u154,m10,WADE,What are you talking about?
4283,L12123,u143,m10,JILL,I bet you did lots of bad things.
4284,L12122,u154,m10,WADE,It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
4285,L12121,u143,m10,JILL,But it's not funny now.
4286,L12120,u154,m10,WADE,To us it was.
4287,L12119,u143,m10,JILL,Was it funny?
4288,L12118,u154,m10,WADE,"Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that."
4289,L12117,u143,m10,JILL,Did you do that when you were a kid?
4290,L12116,u154,m10,WADE,I guess they're stupid.
4291,L12115,u143,m10,JILL,Yeah. It's stupid.
4292,L12114,u154,m10,WADE,Break stuff?
4293,L12113,u143,m10,JILL,You know.
4294,L12112,u154,m10,WADE,Do what?
4295,L12111,u143,m10,JILL,Why do they do that?
4296,L12110,u154,m10,WADE,"Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ."
4297,L12109,u143,m10,JILL,I don't care. They're out.
4298,L12108,u154,m10,WADE,Those are the Hoyts.
4299,L12107,u143,m10,JILL,Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
4300,L12106,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah.
4301,L12105,u143,m10,JILL,"Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy."
4302,L12104,u154,m10,WADE,"I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember."
4303,L12767,u154,m10,WADE,"Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother."
4304,L12766,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"The key, Wade."
4305,L12765,u154,m10,WADE,"You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?"
4306,L12764,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys."
4307,L12703,u154,m10,WADE,"Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right."
4308,L12702,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Could be.
4309,L12701,u154,m10,WADE,You and Mel Gordon?
4310,L12700,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Maybe.
4311,L12699,u154,m10,WADE,I won't. You interested?
4312,L12698,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
4313,L12697,u154,m10,WADE,Want to buy?
4314,L12696,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?"
4315,L12695,u154,m10,WADE,That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
4316,L12694,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
4317,L12693,u154,m10,WADE,You? Why?
4318,L12692,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me."
4319,L12691,u154,m10,WADE,He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
4320,L12690,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,So?
4321,L12689,u154,m10,WADE,I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
4322,L12688,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little."
4323,L12687,u154,m10,WADE,What do I have to do for it?
4324,L12684,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch."
4325,L12683,u154,m10,WADE,On what you pay me?
4326,L12682,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?"
4327,L12681,u154,m10,WADE,Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
4328,L12576,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
4329,L12575,u154,m10,WADE,"I'm fine, fine."
4330,L12574,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"How you holding up, Wade?"
4331,L12397,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time."
4332,L12396,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah. A few things.
4333,L12395,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Something bugging you?
4334,L12394,u154,m10,WADE,"It ain't done, if that's what you mean."
4335,L12393,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
4336,L12378,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling."
4337,L12377,u154,m10,WADE,You want me to follow them to Littleton?
4338,L12376,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
4339,L12375,u154,m10,WADE,Like hell.
4340,L12374,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
4341,L12373,u154,m10,WADE,I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
4342,L12372,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
4343,L12371,u154,m10,WADE,He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
4344,L12370,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck."
4345,L12369,u154,m10,WADE,You mean Twombley?
4346,L12368,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
4347,L12367,u154,m10,WADE,"Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume."
4348,L12366,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
4349,L12365,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,"Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck."
4350,L12364,u154,m10,WADE,I figured you already heard.
4351,L12363,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Huh?
4352,L12362,u154,m10,WADE,A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
4353,L12361,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,What's the hurry?
4354,L12297,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
4355,L12296,u154,m10,WADE,Fuck you.
4356,L12295,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
4357,L12294,u154,m10,WADE,I'm not saying that.
4358,L12293,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,You don't want the extra police pay?
4359,L12292,u154,m10,WADE,"What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends."
4360,L12291,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Don't go playing policeman.
4361,L12290,u154,m10,WADE,At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
4362,L12289,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Huh?
4363,L12288,u154,m10,WADE,His son-in-law damn near killed me.
4364,L12287,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
4365,L12286,u154,m10,WADE,Where's the plow?
4366,L12285,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
4367,L12235,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
4368,L12234,u154,m10,WADE,"Tomorrow, Gordon."
4369,L12129,u154,m10,WADE,Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
4370,L12128,u144,m10,LARIVIERE,We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
4371,L12798,u145,m10,LILLIAN,You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
4372,L12797,u154,m10,WADE,Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
4373,L12796,u145,m10,LILLIAN,You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
4374,L12795,u154,m10,WADE,"No problem. Look, I..."
4375,L12792,u154,m10,WADE,Hi honey.
4376,L12791,u145,m10,LILLIAN,See. Get your boots.
4377,L12790,u154,m10,WADE,"Yeah, lots."
4378,L12789,u145,m10,LILLIAN,Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
4379,L12604,u145,m10,LILLIAN,Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
4380,L12603,u154,m10,WADE,It's just...
4381,L12602,u145,m10,LILLIAN,"We've done all our talking, Wade."
4382,L12601,u154,m10,WADE,We should talk.
4383,L12600,u145,m10,LILLIAN,"No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far."
4384,L12599,u154,m10,WADE,You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
4385,L12218,u154,m10,WADE,"I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?"
4386,L12217,u145,m10,LILLIAN,Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
4387,L12216,u154,m10,WADE,"I don't want her to go, Lillian."
4388,L12213,u154,m10,WADE,"Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake."
4389,L12212,u145,m10,LILLIAN,"She's grown up some, hasn't she?"
4390,L12211,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah.
4391,L12210,u145,m10,LILLIAN,"While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?"
4392,L12208,u145,m10,LILLIAN,Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
4393,L12207,u154,m10,WADE,"Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --"
4394,L12206,u145,m10,LILLIAN,Where's Jill?
4395,L12205,u154,m10,WADE,Lillian!
4396,L12262,u154,m10,WADE,"From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned."
4397,L12261,u146,m10,LUGENE,I still don't understand --
4398,L12260,u154,m10,WADE,Mel Gordon.
4399,L12259,u146,m10,LUGENE,Good. Who?
4400,L12258,u154,m10,WADE,I know who it is.
4401,L12257,u146,m10,LUGENE,Did you get his number?
4402,L12256,u154,m10,WADE,Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
4403,L12255,u146,m10,LUGENE,"Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?"
4404,L12844,u147,m10,MARGIE,"Don't be silly. Hi, Jill."
4405,L12843,u154,m10,WADE,"Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that."
4406,L12842,u147,m10,MARGIE,I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
4407,L12841,u154,m10,WADE,"Going somewhere, Margie?"
4408,L12785,u154,m10,WADE,"Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit."
4409,L12784,u147,m10,MARGIE,"I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?"
4410,L12783,u154,m10,WADE,It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
4411,L12782,u147,m10,MARGIE,What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
4412,L12713,u154,m10,WADE,"Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry."
4413,L12712,u147,m10,MARGIE,What happened?
4414,L12582,u147,m10,MARGIE,Wade.
4415,L12581,u154,m10,WADE,This is nuts.
4416,L12534,u154,m10,WADE,I don't know for Christ's sake!
4417,L12533,u147,m10,MARGIE,How?
4418,L12532,u154,m10,WADE,Of course! I would've heard.
4419,L12531,u147,m10,MARGIE,Think they're alright?
4420,L12530,u154,m10,WADE,Strange.
4421,L12529,u154,m10,WADE,The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
4422,L12528,u147,m10,MARGIE,Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
4423,L12527,u154,m10,WADE,I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
4424,L12526,u147,m10,MARGIE,I know your parents.
4425,L12525,u154,m10,WADE,Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
4426,L12524,u147,m10,MARGIE,Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
4427,L12516,u154,m10,WADE,Good.
4428,L12515,u147,m10,MARGIE,Alright. I'll think about it.
4429,L12514,u154,m10,WADE,"It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?"
4430,L12513,u147,m10,MARGIE,You've been married twice --
4431,L12512,u154,m10,WADE,"I've been thinking about it, that's all."
4432,L12511,u147,m10,MARGIE,"Oh, Wade."
4433,L12510,u154,m10,WADE,"There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me."
4434,L12509,u147,m10,MARGIE,Then... I guess you have to.
4435,L12508,u154,m10,WADE,"I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight."
4436,L12507,u147,m10,MARGIE,"Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?"
4437,L12506,u147,m10,MARGIE,It's nice.
4438,L12505,u154,m10,WADE,After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
4439,L12504,u147,m10,MARGIE,What way?
4440,L12503,u154,m10,WADE,"Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way."
4441,L12502,u147,m10,MARGIE,You knew me as a kid.
4442,L12501,u154,m10,WADE,I can see what you looked like as a kid.
4443,L12499,u147,m10,MARGIE,But not now.
4444,L12498,u154,m10,WADE,"No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know."
4445,L12497,u147,m10,MARGIE,"You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money."
4446,L12496,u154,m10,WADE,"No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age."
4447,L12495,u147,m10,MARGIE,The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
4448,L12494,u154,m10,WADE,"Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia."
4449,L12493,u147,m10,MARGIE,"Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?"
4450,L12492,u154,m10,WADE,Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
4451,L12491,u147,m10,MARGIE,Jack doesn't need money.
4452,L12490,u154,m10,WADE,Money.
4453,L12489,u147,m10,MARGIE,"Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?"
4454,L12488,u154,m10,WADE,"I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose."
4455,L12487,u147,m10,MARGIE,"...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else."
4456,L12486,u154,m10,WADE,"I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did."
4457,L12485,u147,m10,MARGIE,I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
4458,L12484,u154,m10,WADE,"There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually."
4459,L12483,u147,m10,MARGIE,"Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks."
4460,L12350,u147,m10,MARGIE,Okay.
4461,L12349,u154,m10,WADE,Tonight. Let's get together.
4462,L12348,u147,m10,MARGIE,Call me.
4463,L12344,u154,m10,WADE,"The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her."
4464,L12343,u147,m10,MARGIE,"No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you."
4465,L12342,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah. I mean that.
4466,L12341,u147,m10,MARGIE,You don't mean that.
4467,L12340,u154,m10,WADE,I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
4468,L12339,u147,m10,MARGIE,I'm sorry.
4469,L12338,u154,m10,WADE,Forget it.
4470,L12337,u147,m10,MARGIE,About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
4471,L12336,u154,m10,WADE,Said what?
4472,L12335,u147,m10,MARGIE,I'm sorry about what I said.
4473,L12334,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah.
4474,L12333,u147,m10,MARGIE,You okay?
4475,L12233,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah.
4476,L12232,u147,m10,MARGIE,You okay?
4477,L12231,u154,m10,WADE,"See you tomorrow, maybe."
4478,L12230,u147,m10,MARGIE,"Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break."
4479,L12225,u147,m10,MARGIE,"You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off."
4480,L12224,u154,m10,WADE,Okay. She's fine.
4481,L12223,u147,m10,MARGIE,How's she doing?
4482,L12222,u154,m10,WADE,For a while.
4483,L12221,u147,m10,MARGIE,"New hat?  Jill's up, I see."
4484,L12564,u151,m10,POP,Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
4485,L12563,u147,m10,MARGIE,Can --?
4486,L12562,u151,m10,POP,It makes me sad.
4487,L12555,u151,m10,POP,Is...? She's dead then?
4488,L12554,u147,m10,MARGIE,When did she die?
4489,L12553,u151,m10,POP,Coffee's perked.
4490,L12550,u147,m10,MARGIE,"Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?"
4491,L12549,u151,m10,POP,It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
4492,L12548,u147,m10,MARGIE,You're not using it today?
4493,L12547,u151,m10,POP,There's a furnace.
4494,L12546,u147,m10,MARGIE,Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
4495,L12482,u148,m10,MEL GORDON,"You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!"
4496,L12481,u154,m10,WADE,Yes. Here's your ticket.
4497,L12480,u148,m10,MEL GORDON,Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
4498,L12479,u154,m10,WADE,"Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --"
4499,L12478,u148,m10,MEL GORDON,"You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?"
4500,L12477,u154,m10,WADE,"Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon."
4501,L12476,u148,m10,MEL GORDON,Hold on!
4502,L12475,u154,m10,WADE,"Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--"
4503,L12474,u148,m10,MEL GORDON,"Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?"
4504,L12473,u154,m10,WADE,I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
4505,L12472,u148,m10,MEL GORDON,What the hell are you talking about?
4506,L12471,u154,m10,WADE,"Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment."
4507,L12470,u148,m10,MEL GORDON,"I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'"
4508,L12469,u154,m10,WADE,How's that?
4509,L12468,u148,m10,MEL GORDON,"Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead."
4510,L12467,u149,m10,MRS. GORDON,"Can't it wait, then?"
4511,L12466,u154,m10,WADE,"Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal."
4512,L12465,u149,m10,MRS. GORDON,Something about my father?
4513,L12464,u154,m10,WADE,"Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer."
4514,L12463,u149,m10,MRS. GORDON,Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
4515,L12462,u154,m10,WADE,"Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley."
4516,L12461,u149,m10,MRS. GORDON,He's asleep. We were up very late.
4517,L12460,u154,m10,WADE,"I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?"
4518,L12459,u149,m10,MRS. GORDON,Who are you?
4519,L12840,u150,m10,NICK,"No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed."
4520,L12839,u154,m10,WADE,He got his deer yet?
4521,L12838,u150,m10,NICK,"Well, I guess -- that's what he said."
4522,L12837,u154,m10,WADE,His office. You mean my old office.
4523,L12836,u150,m10,NICK,"Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall."
4524,L12832,u150,m10,NICK,"It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub."
4525,L12831,u154,m10,WADE,"Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?"
4526,L12358,u154,m10,WADE,"No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go."
4527,L12357,u150,m10,NICK,"CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?"
4528,L12356,u154,m10,WADE,Where... how'd you hear that?
4529,L12355,u150,m10,NICK,The other guy.
4530,L12354,u154,m10,WADE,Jack?
4531,L12353,u150,m10,NICK,The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
4532,L12352,u154,m10,WADE,Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
4533,L12351,u150,m10,NICK,You talked to Jack?
4534,L12347,u150,m10,NICK,Marg! You got orders!
4535,L12346,u154,m10,WADE,"That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different."
4536,L12345,u150,m10,NICK,Marg!
4537,L12331,u154,m10,WADE,"Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with ""Home Made Cooking"", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong."
4538,L12330,u150,m10,NICK,This town sucks.
4539,L12329,u154,m10,WADE,"I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too."
4540,L12328,u150,m10,NICK,"Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it."
4541,L12327,u154,m10,WADE,The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
4542,L12326,u150,m10,NICK,What?
4543,L12325,u154,m10,WADE,It don't look right.
4544,L12229,u154,m10,WADE,"You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know."
4545,L12228,u150,m10,NICK,"Take care, Wade."
4546,L12864,u154,m10,WADE,I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
4547,L12863,u151,m10,POP,"Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!"
4548,L12862,u154,m10,WADE,Crawl!
4549,L12861,u151,m10,POP,"Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!"
4550,L12860,u154,m10,WADE,You and me.
4551,L12859,u151,m10,POP,Bang!
4552,L12858,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah.
4553,L12857,u151,m10,POP,Everything you know is from me.
4554,L12856,u154,m10,WADE,Call it what you want.
4555,L12855,u151,m10,POP,Love! I'm made of love!
4556,L12854,u154,m10,WADE,Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
4557,L12853,u151,m10,POP,"Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!"
4558,L12852,u154,m10,WADE,You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
4559,L12851,u151,m10,POP,"You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!"
4560,L12719,u151,m10,POP,"You think you can take me now? Come on, try."
4561,L12718,u154,m10,WADE,"Pop, for Christ's sake!"
4562,L12590,u151,m10,POP,"Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head."
4563,L12589,u154,m10,WADE,"Listen, it's no big deal, Pop."
4564,L12561,u151,m10,POP,Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
4565,L12560,u154,m10,WADE,Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
4566,L12559,u151,m10,POP,In the living room.
4567,L12558,u154,m10,WADE,Is there something wrong with the phone?
4568,L12557,u151,m10,POP,I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
4569,L12556,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah.
4570,L12545,u151,m10,POP,She's coming.
4571,L12544,u154,m10,WADE,Where's Ma?
4572,L12542,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah.
4573,L12541,u151,m10,POP,We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
4574,L12540,u154,m10,WADE,How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
4575,L12539,u151,m10,POP,From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
4576,L12538,u154,m10,WADE,You remember Margie Fogg?
4577,L12537,u151,m10,POP,Sleeping.
4578,L12536,u154,m10,WADE,"Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?"
4579,L12324,u151,m10,POP,You no-good pup!
4580,L12323,u154,m10,WADE,Nothing.
4581,L12322,u151,m10,POP,"What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!"
4582,L12312,u151,m10,POP,Atta-go.
4583,L12311,u154,m10,WADE,Just do it.
4584,L12310,u151,m10,POP,"A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!"
4585,L12309,u154,m10,WADE,Rolfe.
4586,L12771,u152,m10,ROLFE,"Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this."
4587,L12770,u154,m10,WADE,"To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?"
4588,L12769,u152,m10,ROLFE,For what?
4589,L12768,u154,m10,WADE,I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
4590,L12727,u154,m10,WADE,But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
4591,L12726,u152,m10,ROLFE,"Wade, are you alright?"
4592,L12725,u154,m10,WADE,"Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another."
4593,L12649,u154,m10,WADE,That's what you think.
4594,L12648,u152,m10,ROLFE,"I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence."
4595,L12647,u154,m10,WADE,"Well, I never heard that one."
4596,L12646,u152,m10,ROLFE,And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
4597,L12645,u154,m10,WADE,We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
4598,L12644,u152,m10,ROLFE,"It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne."
4599,L12643,u154,m10,WADE,You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
4600,L12642,u152,m10,ROLFE,"It may have happened, but not the way you said."
4601,L12641,u154,m10,WADE,Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
4602,L12640,u152,m10,ROLFE,"I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened."
4603,L12639,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah.
4604,L12638,u152,m10,ROLFE,"I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after."
4605,L12637,u152,m10,ROLFE,"I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?"
4606,L12636,u154,m10,WADE,"Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?"
4607,L12635,u152,m10,ROLFE,Not particularly.
4608,L12634,u154,m10,WADE,"It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?"
4609,L12633,u154,m10,WADE,"Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled."
4610,L12632,u152,m10,ROLFE,A hunting accident is perfect.
4611,L12631,u154,m10,WADE,So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
4612,L12630,u152,m10,ROLFE,"Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved."
4613,L12629,u154,m10,WADE,"Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?"
4614,L12628,u152,m10,ROLFE,"Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?"
4615,L12627,u154,m10,WADE,I don't know. You tell me.
4616,L12626,u152,m10,ROLFE,They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
4617,L12625,u154,m10,WADE,Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
4618,L12624,u152,m10,ROLFE,Money.
4619,L12623,u154,m10,WADE,Motive. You gotta have a motive.
4620,L12622,u152,m10,ROLFE,"Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt."
4621,L12621,u154,m10,WADE,Then who shot him?
4622,L12620,u152,m10,ROLFE,That it wasn't an accident.
4623,L12619,u154,m10,WADE,Which is?
4624,L12618,u152,m10,ROLFE,I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
4625,L12617,u154,m10,WADE,Find them everywhere.
4626,L12616,u152,m10,ROLFE,Want to know what I think happened?
4627,L12615,u154,m10,WADE,"I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks."
4628,L12614,u152,m10,ROLFE,Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
4629,L12613,u154,m10,WADE,"I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys."
4630,L12612,u154,m10,WADE,"Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it."
4631,L12611,u152,m10,ROLFE,"Well, do you still plan to get married?"
4632,L12610,u154,m10,WADE,What about her?
4633,L12609,u152,m10,ROLFE,What about Margie?
4634,L12573,u154,m10,WADE,Yeah. I forgot.
4635,L12572,u152,m10,ROLFE,No thanks. I don't drink.
4636,L12571,u154,m10,WADE,Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
4637,L12569,u152,m10,ROLFE,What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
4638,L12568,u154,m10,WADE,"Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess."
4639,L12458,u154,m10,WADE,"No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit."
4640,L12457,u152,m10,ROLFE,Haven't you already done a bit of that?
4641,L12456,u154,m10,WADE,"I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it."
4642,L12455,u152,m10,ROLFE,Get some sleep.
4643,L12454,u154,m10,WADE,"Yeah, I guess."
4644,L12453,u152,m10,ROLFE,Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
4645,L12452,u154,m10,WADE,"A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill."
4646,L12451,u152,m10,ROLFE,What happened?
4647,L12450,u154,m10,WADE,Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
4648,L12449,u152,m10,ROLFE,Who?
4649,L12448,u154,m10,WADE,Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
4650,L12447,u152,m10,ROLFE,How was she?
4651,L12446,u154,m10,WADE,The night before the shooting.
4652,L12445,u152,m10,ROLFE,Huh?
4653,L12444,u154,m10,WADE,Lillian was here. In Lawford.
4654,L12443,u152,m10,ROLFE,"They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body."
4655,L12442,u154,m10,WADE,"Well, it was an accident."
4656,L12441,u152,m10,ROLFE,You think Jack shot him?
4657,L12440,u154,m10,WADE,No shit.
4658,L12439,u152,m10,ROLFE,Twombley.
4659,L12438,u154,m10,WADE,Who?
4660,L12437,u152,m10,ROLFE,He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
4661,L12436,u154,m10,WADE,It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
4662,L12435,u154,m10,WADE,"No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did."
4663,L12434,u152,m10,ROLFE,"Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits."
4664,L12433,u154,m10,WADE,"Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend."
4665,L12432,u152,m10,ROLFE,There was something. It happened up your way.
4666,L12431,u154,m10,WADE,"Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?"
4667,L12430,u152,m10,ROLFE,Wade?
4668,L12429,u154,m10,WADE,Rolfe.
4669,L17221,u171,m11,ROSE,Jim... for godsake!
4670,L17220,u155,m11,ALICE,"Daddy. Daddy, please..."
4671,L17000,u155,m11,ALICE,I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
4672,L16999,u171,m11,ROSE,Yes dear?
4673,L16998,u155,m11,ALICE,Mom?
4674,L16676,u155,m11,ALICE,Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
4675,L16675,u171,m11,ROSE,You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
4676,L16674,u155,m11,ALICE,That's not really the point.
4677,L16673,u171,m11,ROSE,Some kids were teasing you?
4678,L16672,u155,m11,ALICE,I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
4679,L16671,u171,m11,ROSE,Your father never means to be so...
4680,L16670,u155,m11,ALICE,When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
4681,L16669,u155,m11,ALICE,"No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?"
4682,L16668,u171,m11,ROSE,"I'm sorry, honey."
4683,L16667,u155,m11,ALICE,He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
4684,L16666,u155,m11,ALICE,"I know, Mom.  It was great... really."
4685,L16665,u171,m11,ROSE,"We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime."
4686,L16664,u155,m11,ALICE,Back at The Fishbowl?
4687,L16663,u171,m11,ROSE,You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
4688,L16662,u155,m11,ALICE,"Mom, just this once, give it a rest."
4689,L16661,u171,m11,ROSE,Alice...
4690,L16660,u155,m11,ALICE,"Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream."
4691,L16658,u171,m11,ROSE,Don't you even want to ask?
4692,L16657,u155,m11,ALICE,I'm sure he's busy.
4693,L16656,u171,m11,ROSE,You don't want to say hi to your father?
4694,L16653,u155,m11,ALICE,"Yeah, no duh."
4695,L16652,u171,m11,ROSE,"Well, you aren't the President, dear."
4696,L16651,u155,m11,ALICE,It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
4697,L17197,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"You are a resilient man, Mr."
4698,L17196,u155,m11,ALICE,He didn't leave us.
4699,L17107,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
4700,L17106,u155,m11,ALICE,"Fuck off, you stupid asshole."
4701,L17061,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?"
4702,L17060,u155,m11,ALICE,The woman you shot. She was my friend.
4703,L16918,u155,m11,ALICE,Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
4704,L16917,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?"
4705,L16916,u155,m11,ALICE,"Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents."
4706,L16915,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age."
4707,L16914,u155,m11,ALICE,You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
4708,L16907,u155,m11,ALICE,"No, thank you. The gunfire did that."
4709,L16906,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
4710,L16905,u155,m11,ALICE,I don't drink coffee.
4711,L17398,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Okay, I'm slowing us down."
4712,L17397,u155,m11,ALICE,There they are!
4713,L17301,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay."
4714,L17300,u155,m11,ALICE,Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
4715,L17288,u155,m11,ALICE,"Been better, Dad... You?"
4716,L17287,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"How you doing, sweetie?"
4717,L17217,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Alice... I...
4718,L17216,u155,m11,ALICE,Daddy...
4719,L16754,u155,m11,ALICE,Daddy...
4720,L16753,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Alice!
4721,L16682,u169,m11,MARSHALL,How `bout a hug for the old man.
4722,L16681,u155,m11,ALICE,It was the experience of a lifetime.
4723,L16680,u169,m11,MARSHALL,How was...  ...the ballet?
4724,L16679,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Hey, you guys back already?"
4725,L16678,u155,m11,ALICE,"Oooooh, I'm good."
4726,L17310,u156,m11,CERALLOS,Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
4727,L17309,u163,m11,IRAQI SOLDIER,The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
4728,L17308,u156,m11,CERALLOS,The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
4729,L17307,u163,m11,IRAQI SOLDIER,They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
4730,L17306,u156,m11,CERALLOS,It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
4731,L17305,u163,m11,IRAQI SOLDIER,Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
4732,L17304,u156,m11,CERALLOS,Did we warn them off?
4733,L17303,u163,m11,IRAQI SOLDIER,The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
4734,L17077,u157,m11,CHIEF MECHANIC,"cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out."
4735,L17076,u169,m11,MARSHALL,It's cut.
4736,L17071,u157,m11,CHIEF MECHANIC,"Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?"
4737,L17070,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here."
4738,L17069,u157,m11,CHIEF MECHANIC,"Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up."
4739,L17068,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Got it.
4740,L17067,u157,m11,CHIEF MECHANIC,Do you see the maintenance panel?
4741,L17379,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,"Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here."
4742,L17378,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
4743,L17377,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,"Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control."
4744,L17376,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,Lemme take a look.
4745,L17375,u169,m11,MARSHALL,No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
4746,L17374,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,"Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in."
4747,L17373,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Uh, we got a problem here."
4748,L17359,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
4749,L17358,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"How we doing, Colonel?"
4750,L17357,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,Stay cool.
4751,L17356,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Got it.
4752,L17355,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
4753,L17354,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
4754,L17350,u169,m11,MARSHALL,I'm doing what I can.
4755,L17349,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,Who's flying the fucking plane?
4756,L17348,u169,m11,MARSHALL,He's busy being dead.
4757,L17347,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,Put your pilot on.
4758,L17346,u169,m11,MARSHALL,You read my mind.
4759,L17345,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,"Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here."
4760,L17338,u158,m11,COL. CARLTON,Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
4761,L17337,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One."
4762,L17384,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,"That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice."
4763,L17383,u159,m11,DEAN,I prefered the terrorists.
4764,L17382,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,"They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel."
4765,L17279,u159,m11,DEAN,This doesn't make sense.
4766,L17278,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,They aren't answering their hails.
4767,L16849,u159,m11,DEAN,That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
4768,L16848,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,"Walter, if you have a point, make it."
4769,L16844,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
4770,L16843,u159,m11,DEAN,We don't know that.
4771,L16842,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,He's dead then. They must have killed him.
4772,L16718,u169,m11,MARSHALL,An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
4773,L16717,u160,m11,DOHERTY,The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
4774,L16591,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
4775,L16590,u160,m11,DOHERTY,Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
4776,L16581,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
4777,L16580,u160,m11,DOHERTY,"It was a good ad-lib, sir."
4778,L16579,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
4779,L16578,u160,m11,DOHERTY,"Sir, you threw out page two."
4780,L17386,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,To swear you in as President.
4781,L17385,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
4782,L17285,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,"If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage."
4783,L17284,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
4784,L17283,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,"If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission."
4785,L17195,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,"Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard."
4786,L17194,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,"They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?"
4787,L16881,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,"Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike."
4788,L16880,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,"I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff."
4789,L16879,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,But they start executing hostages in
4790,L16878,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
4791,L16877,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,Can we do that?
4792,L16801,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,"Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?"
4793,L16800,u161,m11,GENERAL NORTHWOOD,General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
4794,L17204,u162,m11,GIBBS,My loyalty was never to my country.
4795,L17203,u169,m11,MARSHALL,You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
4796,L17202,u162,m11,GIBBS,Because it is my duty.
4797,L17201,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Why?
4798,L17200,u162,m11,GIBBS,"Yes, Mr. President."
4799,L17199,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
4800,L17170,u164,m11,KC-135 PILOT,Ga get it.
4801,L17169,u162,m11,GIBBS,That's affirmative.
4802,L17166,u162,m11,GIBBS,Roger.
4803,L17165,u164,m11,KC-135 PILOT,"Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots."
4804,L17164,u162,m11,GIBBS,"Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP."
4805,L17163,u164,m11,KC-135 PILOT,Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
4806,L17162,u162,m11,GIBBS,About goddamn time.
4807,L17161,u164,m11,KC-135 PILOT,"Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane."
4808,L17095,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House."
4809,L17094,u162,m11,GIBBS,Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
4810,L17093,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Where are we now?
4811,L17092,u162,m11,GIBBS,"Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq."
4812,L17091,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,We're not going to make it.
4813,L17090,u162,m11,GIBBS,We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
4814,L17083,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
4815,L17082,u162,m11,GIBBS,"Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior."
4816,L17081,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,How?
4817,L16995,u162,m11,GIBBS,Well it worked.
4818,L16994,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
4819,L16993,u162,m11,GIBBS,why did they do that?
4820,L16992,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
4821,L16890,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,A secret service agent. It must be.
4822,L16889,u162,m11,GIBBS,We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
4823,L16888,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Who did this?
4824,L16791,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Any of us?
4825,L16790,u162,m11,GIBBS,Nine.
4826,L16789,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,How many others killed?
4827,L16788,u162,m11,GIBBS,Dead.
4828,L16787,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,The rest of the secret service?
4829,L16573,u162,m11,GIBBS,"Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States."
4830,L16572,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,We've already been inspected.
4831,L17451,u176,m11,TOWER,"Copy, Air Force One."
4832,L17450,u165,m11,KC-LO PILOT,"This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard."
4833,L17449,u176,m11,TOWER,"Tower, here."
4834,L17448,u165,m11,KC-LO PILOT,We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
4835,L17446,u176,m11,TOWER,Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
4836,L17445,u165,m11,KC-LO PILOT,Stand by.
4837,L17444,u176,m11,TOWER,"Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over."
4838,L17413,u176,m11,TOWER,"Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal."
4839,L17412,u165,m11,KC-LO PILOT,"Tower, Air Force One has been boarded."
4840,L17036,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell."
4841,L17035,u170,m11,MITCHELL,You're pointing a gun at me.
4842,L17031,u170,m11,MITCHELL,Scared. We're scared.
4843,L17030,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?"
4844,L17029,u170,m11,MITCHELL,I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
4845,L17028,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell."
4846,L17027,u170,m11,MITCHELL,Maria... Maria Mitchell.
4847,L17026,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,*                     Please tell me your name.
4848,L16617,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Thank you.
4849,L16616,u170,m11,MITCHELL,Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
4850,L16614,u170,m11,MITCHELL,"Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center."
4851,L16613,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,And all these rooms here?
4852,L16612,u170,m11,MITCHELL,I guess it depends on your perspective.
4853,L16611,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"A dubious distinction, no?"
4854,L16610,u170,m11,MITCHELL,You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
4855,L16609,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,This is a remarkable aircraft.
4856,L16608,u170,m11,MITCHELL,"Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to."
4857,L16585,u170,m11,MITCHELL,The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
4858,L16584,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
4859,L17248,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
4860,L17247,u171,m11,ROSE,You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
4861,L17225,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Three...
4862,L17224,u171,m11,ROSE,Jim...
4863,L17223,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Four...
4864,L17210,u171,m11,ROSE,Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
4865,L17209,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
4866,L17154,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
4867,L17153,u171,m11,ROSE,Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
4868,L17105,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Say something dear.
4869,L17104,u171,m11,ROSE,No.
4870,L17103,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
4871,L17059,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one."
4872,L17058,u171,m11,ROSE,That was war.
4873,L17057,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people."
4874,L17056,u171,m11,ROSE,How can you? I mean they're people.
4875,L17055,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
4876,L17054,u171,m11,ROSE,Why? Do you enjoy it?
4877,L17053,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Yes
4878,L17052,u171,m11,ROSE,Do you have to be so brutal?
4879,L16913,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
4880,L16912,u171,m11,ROSE,My husband is a very courageous man.
4881,L16911,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,I know he left you behind.
4882,L16910,u171,m11,ROSE,What do you know of my husband?
4883,L16909,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand..."
4884,L16908,u171,m11,ROSE,Leave my daughter alone.
4885,L16895,u171,m11,ROSE,"Come on, Alice."
4886,L16894,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"Now, or he dies, please."
4887,L16817,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day."
4888,L16816,u171,m11,ROSE,What do you want with us?
4889,L16815,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die."
4890,L17298,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Hold on, Alice."
4891,L17297,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
4892,L17295,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down."
4893,L17294,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
4894,L17293,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,There goes your ride.
4895,L17251,u169,m11,MARSHALL,One thing I've learned as
4896,L17250,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"The taste of defeat is bitter, no?"
4897,L17235,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to"
4898,L17234,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Someday, you'll regret my nature."
4899,L17232,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Good. Good.
4900,L17231,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone."
4901,L17230,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,You'll do it?
4902,L17229,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Stop.
4903,L17214,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
4904,L17213,u169,m11,MARSHALL,This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
4905,L17212,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
4906,L17211,u169,m11,MARSHALL,She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
4907,L17208,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs."
4908,L17207,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Over my dead body.
4909,L17206,u166,m11,KORSHUNOV,"Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind."
4910,L17100,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
4911,L17099,u167,m11,LEE,"Finally, we can bargain."
4912,L16873,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
4913,L16872,u167,m11,LEE,"Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks."
4914,L16807,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
4915,L16806,u167,m11,LEE,Twenty minutes?
4916,L16805,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,"Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes."
4917,L16804,u167,m11,LEE,Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
4918,L17174,u169,m11,MARSHALL,That isn't necessary.
4919,L17173,u168,m11,MAJOR CALDWELL,"Sir, we stay with the President."
4920,L17159,u168,m11,MAJOR CALDWELL,"Yes, sir."
4921,L17158,u169,m11,MARSHALL,I'll not going without my family.
4922,L17140,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Got it.
4923,L17139,u168,m11,MAJOR CALDWELL,"Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide."
4924,L17138,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
4925,L17132,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries."
4926,L17131,u168,m11,MAJOR CALDWELL,We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
4927,L17130,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back."
4928,L17122,u168,m11,MAJOR CALDWELL,Gravity.
4929,L17121,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?"
4930,L16720,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
4931,L16719,u168,m11,MAJOR CALDWELL,The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
4932,L16716,u169,m11,MARSHALL,They've gotta be joking.
4933,L16715,u168,m11,MAJOR CALDWELL,Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
4934,L17331,u171,m11,ROSE,You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
4935,L17330,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Flying the plane.
4936,L17329,u171,m11,ROSE,What are you doing?
4937,L17262,u171,m11,ROSE,Both of you.
4938,L17261,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
4939,L17241,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Please... don't start with me.
4940,L17240,u171,m11,ROSE,I don't know why you stayed.
4941,L16709,u171,m11,ROSE,Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
4942,L16708,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer."
4943,L16706,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign."
4944,L16705,u171,m11,ROSE,How did your speech go?
4945,L16704,u169,m11,MARSHALL,This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
4946,L16703,u171,m11,ROSE,I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
4947,L16702,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"I'll make it up to you, I promise."
4948,L16701,u169,m11,MARSHALL,I wish it were that easy...
4949,L16700,u171,m11,ROSE,"But that's the point, Jim. We're right here."
4950,L16699,u169,m11,MARSHALL,I miss you. And I miss her.
4951,L16698,u171,m11,ROSE,What?
4952,L16697,u169,m11,MARSHALL,You know what?
4953,L16694,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?"
4954,L16693,u171,m11,ROSE,"How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks."
4955,L16692,u169,m11,MARSHALL,She's a big girl.  She understands.
4956,L16691,u171,m11,ROSE,"For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person."
4957,L16690,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Rose, I don't have time for this."
4958,L16689,u171,m11,ROSE,Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
4959,L16688,u171,m11,ROSE,"No, Mr. President.  It can't."
4960,L16687,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Can't it wait?
4961,L16686,u171,m11,ROSE,May I speak to you for a moment?
4962,L17150,u173,m11,SECRETARY,"Actually, sir, you could be that someone."
4963,L17149,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Someone should give you a raise.

4965,L17147,u173,m11,SECRETARY,Where are we sending it?
4966,L17137,u173,m11,SECRETARY,"No. I thought about this, Mr."
4967,L17136,u169,m11,MARSHALL,No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
4968,L17135,u173,m11,SECRETARY,The fax machines.
4969,L17134,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Excuse me?
4970,L17133,u173,m11,SECRETARY,The fax machines.
4971,L17010,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
4972,L17009,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,"Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?"
4973,L17008,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,"But this is different, sir. You're the President."
4974,L17007,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target."
4975,L17006,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,and if that means negotiating...
4976,L17005,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
4977,L17004,u177,m11,V.P. CHANDLER,"They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes."
4978,L17003,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Did they say anything about my family?
4979,L16766,u172,m11,SECRET SERVICE AGENT,Two... THREE. GO!
4980,L16765,u169,m11,MARSHALL,But...
4981,L16764,u172,m11,SECRET SERVICE AGENT,One.
4982,L16738,u172,m11,SECRET SERVICE AGENT,"We're handling it, sir."
4983,L16737,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Where's my family?
4984,L16736,u172,m11,SECRET SERVICE AGENT,We're under attack.
4985,L16735,u169,m11,MARSHALL,What's going on?
4986,L16934,u169,m11,MARSHALL,No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
4987,L16933,u175,m11,SWITCHBOARD,Thank you for calling the white House...
4988,L16932,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the...."
4989,L16931,u175,m11,SWITCHBOARD,"Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?"
4990,L16930,u169,m11,MARSHALL,You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
4991,L16929,u175,m11,SWITCHBOARD,"Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced."
4992,L16928,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
4993,L16927,u175,m11,SWITCHBOARD,"Yeah, right."
4994,L16926,u169,m11,MARSHALL,This is the President.
4995,L16925,u175,m11,SWITCHBOARD,who can I say is calling?
4996,L16924,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?"
4997,L16923,u175,m11,SWITCHBOARD,White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
4998,L17404,u169,m11,MARSHALL,We're hooked. Hove into position.
4999,L17403,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,WE'RE HOOKED!
5000,L17400,u169,m11,MARSHALL,DO YOU SEE TEEM?
5001,L17399,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,IT'S OPEN!
5002,L17396,u169,m11,MARSHALL,They better. Fuel's almost gone.
5003,L17395,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
5004,L17325,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Twenty-five years.
5005,L17324,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,"How long's it been since you flew, sir?"
5006,L17323,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Shit.
5007,L17322,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Iraq? Shep, you're fired."
5008,L17321,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,"Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq."
5009,L17313,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,A MiG? Where the hell are we?
5010,L17312,u169,m11,MARSHALL,My god. I think that was a MiG.
5011,L17260,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,Sir...
5012,L17259,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Shepherd.
5013,L17116,u169,m11,MARSHALL,I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
5014,L17115,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,"Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?"
5015,L16684,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?"
5016,L16683,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
5017,L16648,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,"Yes, sir."
5018,L16647,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
5019,L16635,u169,m11,MARSHALL,That's my job.
5020,L16634,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,You give me ulcers.
5021,L16633,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,We'll just say it was in bad taste.
5022,L16632,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please."
5023,L16605,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Did we tape the Duke game?
5024,L16604,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,"Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging."
5025,L16603,u169,m11,MARSHALL,It's bait.  Don't take it.
5026,L16597,u169,m11,MARSHALL,Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
5027,L16596,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,"Other way around, sir."
5028,L16595,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns."
5029,L16594,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
5030,L16593,u169,m11,MARSHALL,I might still have a few chips left.
5031,L16592,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,"With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch."
5032,L16589,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,He and the NRA don't like the wording.
5033,L16588,u169,m11,MARSHALL,"No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?"
5034,L16587,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,You wanna knock of f?
5035,L16577,u169,m11,MARSHALL,I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
5036,L16576,u174,m11,SHEPHERD,*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.

5039,L19032,u184,m12,KRUGER,"I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner."
5040,L19031,u178,m12,COMMISSIONER,Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
5041,L19030,u184,m12,KRUGER,What's the story?
5042,L19029,u178,m12,COMMISSIONER,I was reading too.
5043,L19028,u184,m12,KRUGER,Forget it.  I was reading.
5044,L18588,u184,m12,KRUGER,"You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!"
5045,L18587,u178,m12,COMMISSIONER,"I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down..."
5046,L18586,u184,m12,KRUGER,I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
5047,L18585,u178,m12,COMMISSIONER,That just doesn't make any sense.
5048,L18584,u184,m12,KRUGER,"That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago."
5049,L18382,u184,m12,KRUGER,I just wish it was that simple.
5050,L18381,u178,m12,COMMISSIONER,What?
5051,L18380,u184,m12,KRUGER,Commissioner.
5052,L18379,u178,m12,COMMISSIONER,"You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board."
5053,L18375,u178,m12,COMMISSIONER,"Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown."
5054,L18374,u184,m12,KRUGER,"And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them."
5055,L18373,u178,m12,COMMISSIONER,Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
5056,L18372,u184,m12,KRUGER,"Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing."
5057,L18863,u185,m12,MARY,Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
5058,L18862,u179,m12,DUNN,"What is it, Mary?"
5059,L18861,u185,m12,MARY,"Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?"
5060,L18860,u179,m12,DUNN,Felt like a large asteroid.
5061,L18859,u185,m12,MARY,Yes I did...
5062,L18858,u179,m12,DUNN,Did you feel that?
5063,L18825,u186,m12,OVEUR,You better take this.
5064,L18824,u179,m12,DUNN,Sir?
5065,L18823,u186,m12,OVEUR,Dunn.
5066,L18822,u186,m12,OVEUR,"You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship."
5067,L18821,u179,m12,DUNN,"Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four."
5068,L18785,u186,m12,OVEUR,"You better check it, Unger."
5069,L18784,u179,m12,DUNN,"We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir."
5070,L18716,u179,m12,DUNN,Accelerators down.

5077,L19214,u193,m12,TED,Now!
5078,L19213,u180,m12,ELAINE,Set!
5079,L19212,u193,m12,TED,We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
5080,L19199,u193,m12,TED,I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
5081,L19198,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Not when I'm with you, Ted."
5082,L19197,u193,m12,TED,Are you afraid?
5083,L19196,u193,m12,TED,The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
5084,L19195,u180,m12,ELAINE,"What will happen to him, Ted?"
5085,L19194,u193,m12,TED,That's right -- premature ejection.
5086,L19193,u180,m12,ELAINE,You mean...
5087,L19192,u193,m12,TED,"Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now."
5088,L19191,u180,m12,ELAINE,Simon just ejected!
5089,L19132,u193,m12,TED,That might be the news we've been waiting for.
5090,L19131,u180,m12,ELAINE,"I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will."
5091,L19130,u193,m12,TED,"Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something."
5092,L19119,u180,m12,ELAINE,"That was very well put, Ted."
5093,L19118,u193,m12,TED,"Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program."
5094,L19113,u180,m12,ELAINE,I mean until we start to burn up.
5095,L19112,u193,m12,TED,"Not now, Elaine."
5096,L19111,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, we've only got ten minutes."
5097,L19053,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, please be careful."
5098,L19052,u193,m12,TED,"Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can."
5099,L19012,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, there's no time to explain."
5100,L19011,u193,m12,TED,"Elaine, what's going on?"
5101,L19010,u180,m12,ELAINE,Ted!
5102,L19009,u193,m12,TED,Elaine!
5103,L18801,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone."
5104,L18800,u193,m12,TED,"There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg."
5105,L18799,u180,m12,ELAINE,I'd use the word insane.
5106,L18798,u193,m12,TED,What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
5107,L18797,u180,m12,ELAINE,"The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick."
5108,L18796,u193,m12,TED,"What word would you use, Elaine?"
5109,L18795,u180,m12,ELAINE,"I've never used the word insane, Ted."
5110,L18794,u193,m12,TED,Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
5111,L18793,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital."
5112,L18792,u193,m12,TED,"Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum."
5113,L18791,u180,m12,ELAINE,"We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over."
5114,L18790,u193,m12,TED,"Elaine, we have to go back."
5115,L18789,u180,m12,ELAINE,Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
5116,L18788,u193,m12,TED,Elaine.
5117,L18698,u180,m12,ELAINE,Ted!
5118,L18697,u193,m12,TED,"Not now, Elaine!"
5119,L18696,u180,m12,ELAINE,Ted.
5120,L18695,u193,m12,TED,"I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!"
5121,L18694,u180,m12,ELAINE,"What are you doing, Ted?"
5122,L18677,u193,m12,TED,"Let me by, Elaine."
5123,L18676,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, we're taking off!"
5124,L18675,u193,m12,TED,I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
5125,L18674,u180,m12,ELAINE,Ted!  What are you...?
5126,L18569,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you."
5127,L18568,u193,m12,TED,That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
5128,L18567,u180,m12,ELAINE,If that's the way you want it.
5129,L18566,u193,m12,TED,"No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go."
5130,L18564,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon."
5131,L18563,u193,m12,TED,"His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says."
5132,L18559,u180,m12,ELAINE,"And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now."
5133,L18558,u193,m12,TED,"Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way."
5134,L18557,u193,m12,TED,Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
5135,L18556,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Who's that, Ted?"
5136,L18555,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better."
5137,L18548,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man."
5138,L18547,u193,m12,TED,"Elaine, what happened to us?"
5139,L18546,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself."
5140,L18545,u193,m12,TED,Elaine.
5141,L18529,u193,m12,TED,"You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!"
5142,L18528,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti."
5143,L18527,u193,m12,TED,There's nothing wrong with me!
5144,L18526,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground."
5145,L18525,u193,m12,TED,Ask Simon.
5146,L18524,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted, what's wrong?"
5147,L18512,u193,m12,TED,"I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why."
5148,L18511,u180,m12,ELAINE,"But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out."
5149,L18510,u193,m12,TED,It's got to be stopped!
5150,L18506,u193,m12,TED,"That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk."
5151,L18505,u180,m12,ELAINE,Te...!
5152,L18504,u193,m12,TED,Elaine.
5153,L18701,u190,m12,RUMACK,Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
5154,L18700,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Is he making any progress, Doctor?"
5155,L18699,u190,m12,RUMACK,"The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine."
5156,L18690,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Is that a good sign, Doctor?"
5157,L18689,u190,m12,RUMACK,"You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden."
5158,L18688,u180,m12,ELAINE,I mean for Ted.
5159,L18687,u190,m12,RUMACK,"You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol."
5160,L18686,u180,m12,ELAINE,"What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?"
5161,L18685,u190,m12,RUMACK,"So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick."
5162,L18684,u190,m12,RUMACK,"The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here..."
5163,L18683,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor."
5164,L19179,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Simon, what are you saying?!"
5165,L19178,u191,m12,SIMON,Maybe.
5166,L19177,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there."
5167,L18907,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?"
5168,L18906,u191,m12,SIMON,My career is shot.
5169,L18904,u191,m12,SIMON,We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
5170,L18903,u180,m12,ELAINE,Can't we change course?
5171,L18902,u191,m12,SIMON,He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
5172,L18901,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Simon, what's happening?!"
5173,L18757,u191,m12,SIMON,Roger.
5174,L18756,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit."
5175,L18750,u191,m12,SIMON,That's my girl.
5176,L18749,u180,m12,ELAINE,I think so.
5177,L18748,u191,m12,SIMON,Have you got it straightened out now?
5178,L18543,u180,m12,ELAINE,Don't be too long.
5179,L18542,u191,m12,SIMON,"Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore."
5180,L18533,u191,m12,SIMON,So mentally ill?
5181,L18532,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Simon, why has he become so... so..."
5182,L18531,u191,m12,SIMON,"Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East."
5183,L18503,u180,m12,ELAINE,"No, I've been excited before."
5184,L18502,u191,m12,SIMON,I guess this is a first for you.
5185,L18501,u180,m12,ELAINE,"I'm so excited, Simon."
5186,L18500,u191,m12,SIMON,Frank's the best pilot in the program.
5187,L18397,u191,m12,SIMON,You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
5188,L18396,u180,m12,ELAINE,"But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe."
5189,L18395,u191,m12,SIMON,"Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl."
5190,L18394,u180,m12,ELAINE,"And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman."
5191,L18393,u191,m12,SIMON,Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
5192,L18392,u180,m12,ELAINE,Simon.
5193,L18391,u191,m12,SIMON,For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
5194,L18873,u186,m12,OVEUR,Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
5195,L18872,u180,m12,ELAINE,"No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit."
5196,L18871,u186,m12,OVEUR,"I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine."
5197,L18870,u180,m12,ELAINE,"You can do it from up here, Captain."
5198,L18869,u186,m12,OVEUR,Roger.
5199,L18868,u180,m12,ELAINE,We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
5200,L18867,u186,m12,OVEUR,I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
5201,L18866,u180,m12,ELAINE,"I don't think we have any alternative, Captain."
5202,L18718,u180,m12,ELAINE,"Yes, sir."
5203,L18717,u186,m12,OVEUR,"Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications."
5204,L18856,u189,m12,ROK,"There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>."
5205,L18855,u180,m12,ELAINE,Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
5206,L18854,u189,m12,ROK,"Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that."
5207,L18853,u180,m12,ELAINE,Request; life support systems check.
5208,L18852,u189,m12,ROK,"Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I..."
5209,L18851,u180,m12,ELAINE,Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
5210,L18755,u189,m12,ROK,You have great tits.
5211,L18754,u180,m12,ELAINE,Go ahead.
5212,L18753,u189,m12,ROK,Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
5213,L18752,u180,m12,ELAINE,"That's okay, ROK."
5214,L18751,u189,m12,ROK,"Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago."
5215,L18725,u189,m12,ROK,"Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this."
5216,L18724,u180,m12,ELAINE,That's not possible.
5217,L18723,u189,m12,ROK,Negative.
5218,L18722,u180,m12,ELAINE,That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
5219,L18721,u189,m12,ROK,Negative.

5225,L18775,u181,m12,JIMMY,"Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?"
5226,L18774,u183,m12,JOHN,I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
5227,L18773,u181,m12,JIMMY,I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
5228,L18409,u183,m12,JOHN,"We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury."
5229,L18408,u181,m12,JIMMY,"Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?"
5230,L18844,u186,m12,OVEUR,"Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?"
5231,L18843,u181,m12,JIMMY,Yeah.
5232,L18842,u186,m12,OVEUR,He's a boy dog.
5233,L18841,u181,m12,JIMMY,Sure.
5234,L18840,u186,m12,OVEUR,Can I hold him?
5235,L18839,u181,m12,JIMMY,Scraps.
5236,L18838,u186,m12,OVEUR,"Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?"

5238,L18616,u182,m12,JOE,All right.  Here.
5239,L18615,u194,m12,WIFE,"Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country."
5240,L18614,u182,m12,JOE,I don't want to hear that word!
5241,L18613,u194,m12,WIFE,"Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency."
5242,L18612,u182,m12,JOE,We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
5243,L18611,u194,m12,WIFE,"Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there."
5244,L19151,u193,m12,TED,I'm sure.
5245,L19150,u182,m12,JOE,You're sure?
5246,L19149,u193,m12,TED,"That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you."
5247,L19148,u182,m12,JOE,What?
5248,L19147,u193,m12,TED,"Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance."

5252,L18874,u185,m12,MARY,"Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it."

5260,L18760,u186,m12,OVEUR,"A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over."
5261,L19141,u193,m12,TED,Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
5262,L19140,u185,m12,MARY,What should I say?
5263,L19139,u193,m12,TED,"No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge."
5264,L19138,u185,m12,MARY,A b...
5265,L19137,u193,m12,TED,He's carrying a bomb.
5266,L19136,u185,m12,MARY,"Sixteen 'C', why?"
5267,L19135,u193,m12,TED,Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
5268,L18682,u186,m12,OVEUR,"Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down."

5270,L18632,u191,m12,SIMON,"Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn."
5271,L18631,u186,m12,OVEUR,"Good to be aboard, gentlemen."
5272,L18598,u186,m12,OVEUR,Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
5273,L18597,u191,m12,SIMON,That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
5274,L18593,u191,m12,SIMON,We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
5275,L18592,u186,m12,OVEUR,"Mr. Kurtz, I presume."
5276,L18591,u191,m12,SIMON,Captain Oveur?
5277,L18475,u192,m12,STELLA,Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
5278,L18474,u187,m12,PORTER,"Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it."
5279,L18473,u192,m12,STELLA,"Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute."
5280,L18472,u187,m12,PORTER,"It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work."
5281,L18471,u192,m12,STELLA,Yes.
5282,L18470,u187,m12,PORTER,"Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?"
5283,L18469,u192,m12,STELLA,"Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays."
5284,L18468,u187,m12,PORTER,You folks need any help?
5285,L18608,u188,m12,RECEPTIONIST,But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
5286,L18607,u193,m12,TED,Don't try to stop me!
5287,L18606,u188,m12,RECEPTIONIST,You can't go in there!
5288,L18605,u188,m12,RECEPTIONIST,"Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock."
5289,L18604,u193,m12,TED,"All right, it's a matter of death."
5290,L18603,u188,m12,RECEPTIONIST,"You'll have to be more specific than that, sir."
5291,L18602,u193,m12,TED,"No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death."
5292,L18601,u188,m12,RECEPTIONIST,"Do you have an appointment, sir?"
5293,L18600,u193,m12,TED,I have to see Bud Kruger.
5294,L18989,u193,m12,TED,Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
5295,L18988,u191,m12,SIMON,Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
5296,L18987,u193,m12,TED,Then Elaine was right.
5297,L18986,u191,m12,SIMON,That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
5298,L18985,u193,m12,TED,"Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?"
5299,L18984,u191,m12,SIMON,Striker.
5300,L18519,u193,m12,TED,I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
5301,L18518,u191,m12,SIMON,"You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications."
5302,L18517,u193,m12,TED,Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
5303,L18516,u191,m12,SIMON,"You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker."
5304,L18509,u191,m12,SIMON,"That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return."
5305,L18508,u193,m12,TED,Are you on the Mercury mission?
5306,L18816,u193,m12,TED,"Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time."
5307,L18815,u192,m12,STELLA,No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
5308,L18814,u193,m12,TED,I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
5309,L18813,u192,m12,STELLA,Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
5310,L18812,u193,m12,TED,Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
5311,L18811,u192,m12,STELLA,Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
5312,L18810,u193,m12,TED,People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
5313,L18809,u192,m12,STELLA,Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
5314,L18808,u193,m12,TED,We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
5315,L18807,u192,m12,STELLA,No.  I mean your relationship.
5316,L18806,u193,m12,TED,I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
5317,L18805,u192,m12,STELLA,Do you want to talk about it.
5318,L18804,u192,m12,STELLA,"No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse."
5319,L18803,u193,m12,TED,"I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it."

5323,L18539,u192,m12,STELLA,Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
5324,L18538,u193,m12,TED,"Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?"
5325,L18537,u192,m12,STELLA,"You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington."
5326,L18536,u193,m12,TED,"Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing."
5327,L18535,u192,m12,STELLA,"Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?"
5328,L19838,u195,m13,BERNICE,"That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me."
5329,L19837,u205,m13,MILTON,"Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years."
5330,L19836,u195,m13,BERNICE,No. I'm all alone.
5331,L19835,u205,m13,MILTON,"I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?"
5332,L19714,u205,m13,MILTON,That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
5333,L19713,u195,m13,BERNICE,Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
5334,L19712,u205,m13,MILTON,"You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean."
5335,L19711,u195,m13,BERNICE,"I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me."
5336,L19710,u205,m13,MILTON,"I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage."
5337,L19709,u195,m13,BERNICE,"Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer."
5338,L19708,u205,m13,MILTON,But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
5339,L19707,u195,m13,BERNICE,"Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to."
5340,L19706,u205,m13,MILTON,"After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business."
5341,L19402,u205,m13,MILTON,"No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation."
5342,L19401,u195,m13,BERNICE,"Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?"
5343,L19400,u205,m13,MILTON,Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
5344,L19399,u195,m13,BERNICE,"No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men."
5345,L19398,u205,m13,MILTON,Thank you. Cream?
5346,L19397,u195,m13,BERNICE,"Ah, won't you sit down?"
5347,L19396,u195,m13,BERNICE,That's very nice of you. Thank you.
5348,L19395,u205,m13,MILTON,"I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee."

5350,L19610,u196,m13,CAREY,...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
5351,L19608,u207,m13,MRS. KRAMER,"Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there."
5352,L19607,u196,m13,CAREY,"Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much."
5353,L19606,u207,m13,MRS. KRAMER,Something about a plane with no pilot?
5354,L19605,u196,m13,CAREY,"Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer."
5355,L19604,u207,m13,MRS. KRAMER,"Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there."
5356,L19603,u207,m13,MRS. KRAMER,"Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out."
5357,L19602,u196,m13,CAREY,"Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer."
5358,L19789,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land."
5359,L19788,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,"And the last thing he said to me, ""Doc,"" he said, ""Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"" he said, ""but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."""
5360,L19787,u214,m13,STRIKER,George Zipp said that?
5361,L19757,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
5362,L19756,u214,m13,STRIKER,Surely there must be something you can do.
5363,L19755,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,"I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time."
5364,L19754,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?"
5365,L19753,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
5366,L19736,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?"
5367,L19735,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
5368,L19653,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights."
5369,L19652,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,"Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got."
5370,L19633,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!"
5371,L19632,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,"I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?"
5372,L19631,u214,m13,STRIKER,Surely you can't be serious.
5373,L19630,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,Can you fly this airplane and land it?
5374,L19629,u214,m13,STRIKER,Both pilots!
5375,L19554,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
5376,L19553,u209,m13,OVEUR,"What is it, Doctor? What's happening?"
5377,L19551,u209,m13,OVEUR,"No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!"
5378,L19550,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,You can't take a guess for another two hours?
5379,L19549,u209,m13,OVEUR,Well...not for another two hours.
5380,L19548,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,Can't you take a guess?
5381,L19545,u209,m13,OVEUR,I can't tell.
5382,L19544,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,"Captain, how soon can we land?"
5383,L19601,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,"I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner."
5384,L19600,u198,m13,ELAINE,No. No one that I know of.
5385,L19599,u198,m13,ELAINE,Well...
5386,L19598,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,"All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?"
5387,L19597,u198,m13,ELAINE,No.
5388,L19596,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,"Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?"
5389,L19576,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
5390,L19575,u198,m13,ELAINE,"Just how serious is it, doctor?"
5391,L19573,u198,m13,ELAINE,"He had fish, too."
5392,L19572,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
5393,L19571,u198,m13,ELAINE,"Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too."
5394,L19559,u198,m13,ELAINE,He had fish.
5395,L19558,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,What did he have?
5396,L19557,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,"Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna."
5397,L19556,u198,m13,ELAINE,"Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish."
5398,L19555,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,What was it we had for dinner tonight?
5399,L19541,u198,m13,ELAINE,Certainly.
5400,L19540,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
5401,L19539,u198,m13,ELAINE,A hospital? What is it?
5402,L19538,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
5403,L19534,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,"Yes. Yes, of course."
5404,L19533,u198,m13,ELAINE,We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
5405,L19532,u197,m13,DR. RUMACK,That's right.
5406,L19531,u198,m13,ELAINE,"Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?"
5407,L19857,u198,m13,ELAINE,Uh-huh.
5408,L19856,u214,m13,STRIKER,"See them, Elaine?"
5409,L19833,u198,m13,ELAINE,The gear is down.
5410,L19832,u214,m13,STRIKER,Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
5411,L19831,u198,m13,ELAINE,I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
5412,L19830,u214,m13,STRIKER,Yes?
5413,L19829,u198,m13,ELAINE,Ted...
5414,L19781,u214,m13,STRIKER,I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
5415,L19780,u198,m13,ELAINE,"But Ted, you're the only..."
5416,L19775,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan."
5417,L19774,u198,m13,ELAINE,"What happened, Ted? What went wrong?"
5418,L19773,u214,m13,STRIKER,Rats! I've lost number three.
5419,L19693,u198,m13,ELAINE,It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
5420,L19692,u214,m13,STRIKER,It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
5421,L19691,u198,m13,ELAINE,Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
5422,L19690,u214,m13,STRIKER,Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
5423,L19689,u198,m13,ELAINE,And a little ice!
5424,L19688,u214,m13,STRIKER,And a little ice.
5425,L19687,u198,m13,ELAINE,Rain.
5426,L19651,u214,m13,STRIKER,That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
5427,L19650,u198,m13,ELAINE,Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
5428,L19514,u214,m13,STRIKER,A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
5429,L19513,u198,m13,ELAINE,"Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war."
5430,L19512,u214,m13,STRIKER,I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
5431,L19473,u214,m13,STRIKER,That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
5432,L19472,u198,m13,ELAINE,What's his problem?
5433,L19468,u198,m13,ELAINE,"Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately."
5434,L19467,u214,m13,STRIKER,I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
5435,L19466,u198,m13,ELAINE,"Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?"
5436,L19465,u214,m13,STRIKER,Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
5437,L19464,u198,m13,ELAINE,It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
5438,L19463,u214,m13,STRIKER,Headquarters!? What is it?
5439,L19462,u198,m13,ELAINE,You got a telegram from headquarters today.
5440,L19460,u198,m13,ELAINE,But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
5441,L19459,u214,m13,STRIKER,"That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine."
5442,L19458,u198,m13,ELAINE,"Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us."
5443,L19457,u198,m13,ELAINE,I remember everything. All I have are memories.
5444,L19456,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?"
5445,L19422,u198,m13,ELAINE,I love you.
5446,L19421,u214,m13,STRIKER,"I love you, Elaine."
5447,L19420,u198,m13,ELAINE,"Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much."
5448,L19419,u214,m13,STRIKER,My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
5449,L19418,u198,m13,ELAINE,What's the matter?
5450,L19385,u198,m13,ELAINE,You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
5451,L19384,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Elaine, I've got to talk to you."
5452,L19383,u198,m13,ELAINE,"Ted, what are you doing here?"
5453,L19314,u198,m13,ELAINE,"It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry."
5454,L19313,u214,m13,STRIKER,But if you'll just give me...
5455,L19312,u198,m13,ELAINE,"It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility."
5456,L19311,u214,m13,STRIKER,You expect me to believe that?
5457,L19310,u198,m13,ELAINE,Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
5458,L19309,u214,m13,STRIKER,"You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record."
5459,L19308,u198,m13,ELAINE,Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
5460,L19307,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change."
5461,L19306,u198,m13,ELAINE,I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
5462,L19305,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over."
5463,L19297,u198,m13,ELAINE,It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
5464,L19296,u214,m13,STRIKER,Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
5465,L19295,u198,m13,ELAINE,"I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that."
5466,L19294,u214,m13,STRIKER,"I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out."
5467,L19293,u198,m13,ELAINE,I just don't want to go over it any more.
5468,L19292,u214,m13,STRIKER,"I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you."
5469,L19291,u198,m13,ELAINE,Ted!
5470,L19290,u214,m13,STRIKER,Elaine!
5471,L19526,u209,m13,OVEUR,"Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can."
5472,L19525,u198,m13,ELAINE,"I think so, but I've never seen it so acute."
5473,L19524,u209,m13,OVEUR,Airsick?
5474,L19504,u198,m13,ELAINE,Who wants to be first?
5475,L19503,u209,m13,OVEUR,"Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight."
5476,L19437,u209,m13,OVEUR,Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
5477,L19436,u198,m13,ELAINE,We'd better get back now.
5478,L19425,u209,m13,OVEUR,Hello.
5479,L19424,u198,m13,ELAINE,We have a visitor.
5480,L19368,u213,m13,SOLDIER,"Good-bye, darling."
5481,L19367,u199,m13,GIRL,"Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling."
5482,L19366,u213,m13,SOLDIER,"Good-bye, darling."
5483,L19365,u199,m13,GIRL,"Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill."
5484,L19364,u213,m13,SOLDIER,"So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself."
5485,L19363,u199,m13,GIRL,"Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time."
5486,L19362,u213,m13,SOLDIER,"Good-bye, darling."
5487,L19333,u199,m13,GIRL,Every day.
5488,L19332,u213,m13,SOLDIER,You promise you'll write.
5489,L19331,u199,m13,GIRL,"Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much."
5490,L19849,u203,m13,KRAMER,"All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner."
5491,L19848,u200,m13,GUNDERSON,He's right on the heading.
5492,L19825,u203,m13,KRAMER,"Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather."
5493,L19824,u200,m13,GUNDERSON,He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
5494,L19817,u203,m13,KRAMER,"You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet."
5495,L19816,u200,m13,GUNDERSON,Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
5496,L19809,u200,m13,GUNDERSON,"Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind."
5497,L19808,u203,m13,KRAMER,Did you decide on a runway yet?
5498,L19807,u200,m13,GUNDERSON,"Yes, Captain?"
5499,L19806,u203,m13,KRAMER,And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
5500,L19705,u201,m13,JACK,Here.
5501,L19704,u211,m13,SHIRLEY,"Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up."
5502,L19703,u201,m13,JACK,"How ya doing, honey?"
5503,L19518,u201,m13,JACK,What is it?
5504,L19517,u211,m13,SHIRLEY,"Oh, I can't stand it."
5505,L19330,u211,m13,SHIRLEY,"Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped."
5506,L19329,u201,m13,JACK,What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
5507,L19280,u201,m13,JACK,"Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!"
5508,L19279,u211,m13,SHIRLEY,"Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago."
5509,L19454,u208,m13,MURDOCK,The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
5510,L19453,u202,m13,JOEY,"...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs."
5511,L19452,u208,m13,MURDOCK,We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
5512,L19451,u202,m13,JOEY,...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
5513,L19450,u208,m13,MURDOCK,"Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner."
5514,L19449,u202,m13,JOEY,I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
5515,L19448,u208,m13,MURDOCK,"I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies."
5516,L19445,u208,m13,MURDOCK,"I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?"
5517,L19444,u202,m13,JOEY,You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
5518,L19442,u208,m13,MURDOCK,"I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot."
5519,L19441,u202,m13,JOEY,Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
5520,L19493,u210,m13,RANDY,"Okay, this is one of my favorites."
5521,L19492,u204,m13,LISA,"Oh, I'd love to."
5522,L19491,u210,m13,RANDY,I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
5523,L19490,u204,m13,LISA,"I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!"
5524,L19489,u210,m13,RANDY,I'm Randy.
5525,L19488,u204,m13,LISA,Hi!
5526,L19570,u210,m13,RANDY,"Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly."
5527,L19569,u206,m13,MRS. HAMMEN,"Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?"
5528,L19568,u210,m13,RANDY,"Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?"
5529,L19567,u206,m13,MRS. HAMMEN,"Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?"
5530,L19566,u210,m13,RANDY,Yes?
5531,L19477,u206,m13,MRS. HAMMEN,"I will, but Jim won't."
5532,L19476,u210,m13,RANDY,Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
5533,L19447,u208,m13,MURDOCK,"All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock."
5534,L19446,u209,m13,OVEUR,"No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here."
5535,L19435,u209,m13,OVEUR,"No, why don't you take care ot it?"
5536,L19434,u208,m13,MURDOCK,"Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?"
5537,L19376,u209,m13,OVEUR,"Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?"
5538,L19375,u208,m13,MURDOCK,"We have clearance, Clarence."
5539,L19372,u208,m13,MURDOCK,Huh?
5540,L19371,u209,m13,OVEUR,Roger.
5541,L19370,u208,m13,MURDOCK,Huh?
5542,L19369,u209,m13,OVEUR,Roger.
5543,L19325,u209,m13,OVEUR,"Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock."
5544,L19324,u208,m13,MURDOCK,"Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln."
5545,L19484,u212,m13,SISTER ANGELINA,Of course.
5546,L19483,u210,m13,RANDY,Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
5547,L19482,u212,m13,SISTER ANGELINA,"Oh yes, I saw. Poor child."
5548,L19481,u210,m13,RANDY,There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
5549,L19480,u212,m13,SISTER ANGELINA,Yes?
5550,L19479,u210,m13,RANDY,"Excuse me, Sister?"
5551,L19828,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here."
5552,L19827,u210,m13,RANDY,"Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready."
5553,L19625,u210,m13,RANDY,"Would you go up, please?"
5554,L19624,u214,m13,STRIKER,"Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it."
5555,L19623,u210,m13,RANDY,It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
5556,L19622,u214,m13,STRIKER,The cockpit? What is it?
5557,L19621,u210,m13,RANDY,"Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering..."
5558,L19475,u214,m13,STRIKER,No. No thank you.
5559,L19474,u210,m13,RANDY,"Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?"
5560,L19378,u214,m13,STRIKER,Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
5561,L19377,u210,m13,RANDY,"Do you feel all right, sir?"
5562,L19344,u214,m13,STRIKER,Thank you.
5563,L19343,u210,m13,RANDY,Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
5564,L24643,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,Yeah...
5565,L24642,u224,m14,SYKES,You okay?
5566,L24424,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,"Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes."
5567,L24423,u224,m14,SYKES,I like my horizons narrow.
5568,L24422,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,"I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons."
5569,L24421,u224,m14,SYKES,"There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally."
5570,L24420,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
5571,L24419,u224,m14,SYKES,Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
5572,L24418,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,"I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?"
5573,L24417,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
5574,L24416,u224,m14,SYKES,"The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows."
5575,L24415,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,"Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes."
5576,L24413,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
5577,L24412,u224,m14,SYKES,Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
5578,L24411,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
5579,L24616,u218,m14,JETSON,Show me.
5580,L24615,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,In there.
5581,L24408,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,"She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change."
5582,L24407,u218,m14,JETSON,The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
5583,L24406,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,He's not here.  Why ask me?
5584,L24404,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
5585,L24403,u218,m14,JETSON,"We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--"
5586,L24402,u215,m14,CASSANDRA,That's right.
5587,L24401,u218,m14,JETSON,You are Cassandra?
5588,L24530,u216,m14,FEDORCHUK,"I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing."
5589,L24529,u224,m14,SYKES,"Lay off, asshole."
5590,L24528,u216,m14,FEDORCHUK,"Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?"
5591,L24526,u224,m14,SYKES,"I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do."
5592,L24525,u216,m14,FEDORCHUK,"Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!"
5593,L24192,u216,m14,FEDORCHUK,You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
5594,L24191,u224,m14,SYKES,You don't have squat.
5595,L24190,u216,m14,FEDORCHUK,"Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?"
5596,L24189,u224,m14,SYKES,So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
5597,L24655,u217,m14,HARCOURT,"No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity..."
5598,L24654,u224,m14,SYKES,"Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history..."
5599,L24316,u217,m14,HARCOURT,"That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function."
5600,L24315,u224,m14,SYKES,"You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing."
5601,L24314,u217,m14,HARCOURT,"Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic."
5602,L24309,u217,m14,HARCOURT,Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
5603,L24308,u224,m14,SYKES,"I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department."
5604,L24307,u217,m14,HARCOURT,Yes...
5605,L24306,u224,m14,SYKES,William Harcourt?
5606,L24640,u217,m14,HARCOURT,Do it!
5607,L24639,u219,m14,KIPLING,Here?
5608,L24638,u217,m14,HARCOURT,Kill them both.
5609,L24464,u217,m14,HARCOURT,This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
5610,L24463,u219,m14,KIPLING,"When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley."
5611,L24326,u217,m14,HARCOURT,It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
5612,L24325,u219,m14,KIPLING,He didn't recognize me.
5613,L24324,u217,m14,HARCOURT,This is becoming a serious breach of security.
5614,L24323,u219,m14,KIPLING,"That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver."
5615,L24700,u218,m14,JETSON,You look very good.
5616,L24699,u224,m14,SYKES,How do I look?
5617,L24686,u218,m14,JETSON,You understand that.  But how many others will?
5618,L24685,u224,m14,SYKES,But there's no more drug.
5619,L24684,u218,m14,JETSON,Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
5620,L24683,u224,m14,SYKES,Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
5621,L24682,u218,m14,JETSON,We can't let him get away.
5622,L24681,u224,m14,SYKES,"I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up."
5623,L24680,u224,m14,SYKES,Tell me about it...
5624,L24679,u218,m14,JETSON,"No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're..."
5625,L24678,u224,m14,SYKES,Harcourt is dead.
5626,L24677,u218,m14,JETSON,... It's Harcourt.
5627,L24676,u224,m14,SYKES,What is this?!
5628,L24672,u224,m14,SYKES,Do what?!  George-- ?!
5629,L24671,u218,m14,JETSON,No!  We must do this alone.
5630,L24670,u218,m14,JETSON,There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
5631,L24669,u224,m14,SYKES,"What's this about, George?  I know that look."
5632,L24657,u224,m14,SYKES,"It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective."
5633,L24656,u218,m14,JETSON,"With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now."
5634,L24651,u218,m14,JETSON,Ss-ai!
5635,L24650,u224,m14,SYKES,Shit!
5636,L24610,u218,m14,JETSON,Fuck procedure.
5637,L24609,u224,m14,SYKES,
5638,L24608,u224,m14,SYKES,Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
5639,L24607,u218,m14,JETSON,"The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street."
5640,L24606,u224,m14,SYKES,"George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit."
5641,L24599,u218,m14,JETSON,"Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall."
5642,L24598,u224,m14,SYKES,"George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones..."
5643,L24594,u218,m14,JETSON,Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
5644,L24593,u224,m14,SYKES,"Uh, George..."
5645,L24588,u224,m14,SYKES,"No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?"
5646,L24587,u218,m14,JETSON,"If the drug is here, we must destroy it."
5647,L24586,u224,m14,SYKES,"Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart."
5648,L24585,u224,m14,SYKES,Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
5649,L24584,u218,m14,JETSON,"They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--"
5650,L24565,u218,m14,JETSON,"I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you."
5651,L24564,u224,m14,SYKES,"George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again."
5652,L24563,u218,m14,JETSON,Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
5653,L24562,u224,m14,SYKES,"Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?"
5654,L24561,u218,m14,JETSON,No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
5655,L24560,u224,m14,SYKES,Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
5656,L24559,u218,m14,JETSON,We all did.
5657,L24558,u224,m14,SYKES,We?  You've taken it?
5658,L24557,u218,m14,JETSON,"Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The ""high"" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor."
5659,L24556,u224,m14,SYKES,How potent?
5660,L24555,u218,m14,JETSON,... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
5661,L24554,u224,m14,SYKES,"The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?"
5662,L24553,u218,m14,JETSON,No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
5663,L24552,u224,m14,SYKES,"No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!"
5664,L24550,u218,m14,JETSON,You must leave me alone on this.
5665,L24549,u224,m14,SYKES,"What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it."
5666,L24537,u224,m14,SYKES,... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
5667,L24536,u218,m14,JETSON,Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
5668,L24535,u224,m14,SYKES,"... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style."
5669,L24534,u224,m14,SYKES,Nothing.
5670,L24533,u218,m14,JETSON,What was that about?
5671,L24519,u218,m14,JETSON,Thank you.
5672,L24518,u224,m14,SYKES,"It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes."
5673,L24516,u218,m14,JETSON,Stop the car!
5674,L24515,u224,m14,SYKES,"Come on, you won't have to get near the water."
5675,L24514,u218,m14,JETSON,"Please, I must get out here."
5676,L24513,u224,m14,SYKES,Why?
5677,L24512,u218,m14,JETSON,Stop the car.
5678,L24511,u224,m14,SYKES,"Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!"
5679,L24510,u218,m14,JETSON,To the... to the beach?
5680,L24509,u224,m14,SYKES,"Well, let's roll, George."
5681,L24504,u218,m14,JETSON,She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
5682,L24503,u224,m14,SYKES,"George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?"
5683,L24502,u218,m14,JETSON,She's going to divorce me.
5684,L24501,u218,m14,JETSON,"A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife..."
5685,L24500,u224,m14,SYKES,Where'd you get this?!!
5686,L24496,u224,m14,SYKES,"Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?"
5687,L24495,u218,m14,JETSON,I'm going home.
5688,L24490,u224,m14,SYKES,"Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals."
5689,L24489,u218,m14,JETSON,I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
5690,L24488,u218,m14,JETSON,"You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here."
5691,L24487,u224,m14,SYKES,"No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes."
5692,L24486,u218,m14,JETSON,There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
5693,L24485,u218,m14,JETSON,Ta ss'trakyona'...
5694,L24484,u224,m14,SYKES,Your health...
5695,L24483,u224,m14,SYKES,"Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?"
5696,L24482,u218,m14,JETSON,In the other man's rectum.
5697,L24481,u224,m14,SYKES,"... and so, and so the doctor says, ""If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?""  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?"
5698,L24478,u224,m14,SYKES,Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
5699,L24477,u218,m14,JETSON,"Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then..."
5700,L24475,u224,m14,SYKES,"I appreciate your honesty, George."
5701,L24474,u218,m14,JETSON,Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
5702,L24473,u224,m14,SYKES,"It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place."
5703,L24472,u218,m14,JETSON,We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
5704,L24471,u224,m14,SYKES,Was.  Divorced.
5705,L24470,u218,m14,JETSON,You are married?
5706,L24469,u224,m14,SYKES,Yeah... I know the routine.
5707,L24468,u218,m14,JETSON,My wife?  She worries about me.
5708,L24467,u224,m14,SYKES,"So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?"
5709,L24446,u224,m14,SYKES,"Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes."
5710,L24445,u218,m14,JETSON,I believe he is probably lying.
5711,L24440,u218,m14,JETSON,When will Strader return?
5712,L24439,u224,m14,SYKES,"We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch."
5713,L24432,u218,m14,JETSON,Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
5714,L24431,u224,m14,SYKES,Who is he?
5715,L24400,u224,m14,SYKES,"Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow."
5716,L24399,u218,m14,JETSON,Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
5717,L24398,u224,m14,SYKES,And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
5718,L24397,u218,m14,JETSON,"Ss'loka'.  It means literally ""small but intelligent creature"".  It loses much in the translation."
5719,L24396,u224,m14,SYKES,So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
5720,L24394,u218,m14,JETSON,Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
5721,L24393,u224,m14,SYKES,I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
5722,L24392,u218,m14,JETSON,This is mole.  It's good.
5723,L24391,u224,m14,SYKES,Which one is that?  Raw what?
5724,L24387,u218,m14,JETSON,"Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments."
5725,L24386,u224,m14,SYKES,I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
5726,L24384,u224,m14,SYKES,"Yeah, sure.  I knew that..."
5727,L24383,u218,m14,JETSON,"If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for."
5728,L24375,u218,m14,JETSON,"In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families..."
5729,L24374,u224,m14,SYKES,How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
5730,L24373,u218,m14,JETSON,"From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together."
5731,L24372,u224,m14,SYKES,You know that guy?
5732,L24368,u224,m14,SYKES,Stay back!  I'm okay.
5733,L24367,u218,m14,JETSON,"Matthew, you don't have to-- ."
5734,L24366,u224,m14,SYKES,"That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?"
5735,L24365,u218,m14,JETSON,Your mother mates out of season.
5736,L24364,u224,m14,SYKES,Tell me.
5737,L24361,u224,m14,SYKES,Screw me?  That can't be right.
5738,L24360,u218,m14,JETSON,Screw you.
5739,L24356,u224,m14,SYKES,I'll handle it.
5740,L24355,u218,m14,JETSON,But I-- .
5741,L24354,u224,m14,SYKES,"Back off, George."
5742,L24353,u218,m14,JETSON,"Uh, Matthew..."
5743,L24352,u224,m14,SYKES,"Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?"
5744,L24346,u218,m14,JETSON,At the end of the bar.
5745,L24345,u224,m14,SYKES,Who said that?
5746,L24339,u224,m14,SYKES,"My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing..."
5747,L24338,u218,m14,JETSON,Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
5748,L24337,u224,m14,SYKES,Why'd I do what?
5749,L24336,u218,m14,JETSON,Why did you do it?
5750,L24313,u218,m14,JETSON,"We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley."
5751,L24312,u224,m14,SYKES,"Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time..."
5752,L24302,u218,m14,JETSON,He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
5753,L24301,u224,m14,SYKES,Did you talk to him?
5754,L24300,u218,m14,JETSON,She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
5755,L24299,u224,m14,SYKES,Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
5756,L24298,u218,m14,JETSON,"A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley."
5757,L24297,u224,m14,SYKES,Did you learn anything?
5758,L24296,u218,m14,JETSON,Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
5759,L24284,u224,m14,SYKES,"Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife."
5760,L24283,u218,m14,JETSON,I believe I should interview the widow alone.
5761,L24282,u224,m14,SYKES,"So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that ""possible"" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night."
5762,L24281,u218,m14,JETSON,A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
5763,L24280,u224,m14,SYKES,How the hell do you know that?
5764,L24279,u218,m14,JETSON,Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
5765,L24276,u218,m14,JETSON,And still it fits?
5766,L24275,u224,m14,SYKES,"Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches."
5767,L24274,u218,m14,JETSON,And that fits?
5768,L24273,u224,m14,SYKES,Get the picture?
5769,L24271,u224,m14,SYKES,"A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?"
5770,L24270,u218,m14,JETSON,What is this?
5771,L24269,u218,m14,JETSON,Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
5772,L24268,u224,m14,SYKES,Nothing?
5773,L24267,u218,m14,JETSON,Nothing.
5774,L24266,u224,m14,SYKES,What's this?  What's going on?
5775,L24248,u224,m14,SYKES,"Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?"
5776,L24247,u218,m14,JETSON,"Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--"
5777,L24246,u224,m14,SYKES,"Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?"
5778,L24245,u218,m14,JETSON,"Well... yes, quite possibly."
5779,L24244,u224,m14,SYKES,"Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?"
5780,L24243,u218,m14,JETSON,What is wrong?
5781,L24241,u224,m14,SYKES,"Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him."
5782,L24240,u218,m14,JETSON,Yes.
5783,L24239,u224,m14,SYKES,"Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?"
5784,L24238,u218,m14,JETSON,The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
5785,L24237,u224,m14,SYKES,"The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George..."
5786,L24236,u218,m14,JETSON,There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
5787,L24235,u224,m14,SYKES,Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
5788,L24233,u224,m14,SYKES,"Nice signal, dickwad!"
5789,L24232,u218,m14,JETSON,Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
5790,L24231,u224,m14,SYKES,With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
5791,L24230,u218,m14,JETSON,"His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown."
5792,L24229,u224,m14,SYKES,Let's talk Hubley.
5793,L24227,u218,m14,JETSON,"That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like ""ss'ai k'ss"", two words in my language which mean ""excrement"" and ""cranium""."
5794,L24226,u224,m14,SYKES,"Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?"
5795,L24225,u224,m14,SYKES,"Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?"
5796,L24224,u218,m14,JETSON,My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
5797,L24223,u224,m14,SYKES,"Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?"
5798,L24221,u218,m14,JETSON,I am George.
5799,L24220,u224,m14,SYKES,"What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to."
5800,L24219,u218,m14,JETSON,Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
5801,L24218,u224,m14,SYKES,"... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all."
5802,L24333,u224,m14,SYKES,No... two.
5803,L24332,u220,m14,MAFFET,"Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one."
5804,L24331,u224,m14,SYKES,Only holds five.
5805,L24330,u220,m14,MAFFET,Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
5806,L24329,u224,m14,SYKES,What is it?
5807,L24328,u220,m14,MAFFET,"You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it."
5808,L24601,u221,m14,O'NEAL,"... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon."
5809,L24600,u224,m14,SYKES,"Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up."
5810,L24294,u221,m14,O'NEAL,Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
5811,L24293,u224,m14,SYKES,That where Anderson worked?
5812,L24292,u224,m14,SYKES,I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
5813,L24291,u221,m14,O'NEAL,Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
5814,L24290,u224,m14,SYKES,Who else can I ask around here?
5815,L24289,u221,m14,O'NEAL,"To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me."
5816,L24288,u224,m14,SYKES,"We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?"
5817,L24287,u221,m14,O'NEAL,You think this is the guy who did it?
5818,L24286,u224,m14,SYKES,"Well, one of the men didn't like him so much..."
5819,L24285,u221,m14,O'NEAL,Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
5820,L24579,u222,m14,OPERATOR,Sure.  Just a minute.
5821,L24578,u224,m14,SYKES,Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
5822,L24575,u222,m14,OPERATOR,"I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up..."
5823,L24574,u224,m14,SYKES,Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
5824,L24573,u222,m14,OPERATOR,"Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son."
5825,L24570,u222,m14,OPERATOR,"For you, anything."
5826,L24569,u224,m14,SYKES,"Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?"
5827,L24568,u222,m14,OPERATOR,"Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery."
5828,L24381,u223,m14,PORTER,"That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else."
5829,L24380,u224,m14,SYKES,"Yeah, I heard of it."
5830,L24379,u223,m14,PORTER,Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
5831,L24378,u224,m14,SYKES,"One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?"
5832,L24359,u224,m14,SYKES,What's that?
5833,L24358,u223,m14,PORTER,Ss'kya'ta'.
5834,L24357,u224,m14,SYKES,"Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?"
5835,L24546,u224,m14,SYKES,Did he find anything?
5836,L24545,u227,m14,WINTER,Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
5837,L24544,u224,m14,SYKES,What kind of test?
5838,L24539,u227,m14,WINTER,You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
5839,L24538,u224,m14,SYKES,You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
5840,L24265,u224,m14,SYKES,"Yeah, I'll bet."
5841,L24264,u227,m14,WINTER,"Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff."
5842,L24263,u227,m14,WINTER,That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
5843,L24262,u224,m14,SYKES,Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
5844,L24261,u227,m14,WINTER,"Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts."
5845,L24260,u224,m14,SYKES,Yeah.
5846,L24259,u227,m14,WINTER,"You took this gut out, too, didn't you?"
5847,L24258,u224,m14,SYKES,Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
5848,L24257,u227,m14,WINTER,"No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match."
5849,L24254,u227,m14,WINTER,"Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock."
5850,L24253,u224,m14,SYKES,The human?
5851,L24252,u227,m14,WINTER,"Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--"
5852,L24251,u224,m14,SYKES,"Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours."
5853,L24250,u227,m14,WINTER,You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
5854,L24216,u226,m14,WARNER,Don't tell me what to think.
5855,L24215,u224,m14,SYKES,"Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community..."
5856,L24214,u226,m14,WARNER,Granger and Pitts are already on it.
5857,L24210,u226,m14,WARNER,You?
5858,L24209,u224,m14,SYKES,Departmental policy.
5859,L24208,u226,m14,WARNER,You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
5860,L24204,u224,m14,SYKES,Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
5861,L24203,u226,m14,WARNER,"Yeah, Sykes?"
5862,L24167,u224,m14,SYKES,I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
5863,L24166,u225,m14,TUGGLE,I can't!  Do you mind!
5864,L24165,u224,m14,SYKES,Get outta there!
5865,L24163,u224,m14,SYKES,I got him.  Don't get pinned.
5866,L24162,u225,m14,TUGGLE,Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
5867,L24161,u224,m14,SYKES,"Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too."
5868,L24160,u225,m14,TUGGLE,Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
5869,L24159,u224,m14,SYKES,You got your vest?
5870,L24156,u225,m14,TUGGLE,Whatever gave you that idea?
5871,L24155,u224,m14,SYKES,Does that look at all suspicious to you?
5872,L24153,u224,m14,SYKES,"Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers."
5873,L24152,u225,m14,TUGGLE,But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
5874,L24151,u224,m14,SYKES,"Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--"
5875,L24150,u225,m14,TUGGLE,"Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week..."
5876,L24149,u224,m14,SYKES,What?
5877,L24148,u225,m14,TUGGLE,"Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going."
5878,L24147,u224,m14,SYKES,How can I go?
5879,L24145,u225,m14,TUGGLE,It is.
5880,L24144,u224,m14,SYKES,Hope their plumbing's the same.
5881,L26618,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Uh, seems to be in front and behind."
5882,L26617,u228,m15,APONE,"Talk to me, Hudson."
5883,L26616,u233,m15,HUDSON,Can't lock up...
5884,L26615,u228,m15,APONE,Position?
5885,L26614,u233,m15,HUDSON,Movement!
5886,L26401,u228,m15,APONE,Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
5887,L26400,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?"
5888,L26399,u228,m15,APONE,Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
5889,L26398,u233,m15,HUDSON,Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
5890,L26387,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Would you, Sir?"
5891,L26386,u228,m15,APONE,"Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?"
5892,L26385,u233,m15,HUDSON,This floor's freezing.
5893,L26632,u228,m15,APONE,Say again?  All after incinerators?
5894,L26631,u231,m15,GORMAN,"Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over."
5895,L26606,u228,m15,APONE,Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
5896,L26605,u231,m15,GORMAN,Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
5897,L26487,u228,m15,APONE,"Vasquez, take point.  Let's move."
5898,L26486,u231,m15,GORMAN,"First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear."
5899,L26485,u228,m15,APONE,"Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!"
5900,L26484,u231,m15,GORMAN,"Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station."
5901,L26480,u228,m15,APONE,Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
5902,L26479,u231,m15,GORMAN,"Okay, let's do it."
5903,L26474,u228,m15,APONE,Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
5904,L26473,u231,m15,GORMAN,...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
5905,L26972,u229,m15,BISHOP,"Well, thanks, I --"
5906,L26971,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"You did okay, Bishop."
5907,L26945,u229,m15,BISHOP,In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
5908,L26944,u237,m15,RIPLEY,She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
5909,L26943,u229,m15,BISHOP,Ripley...
5910,L26942,u237,m15,RIPLEY,WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
5911,L26941,u229,m15,BISHOP,PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
5912,L26940,u237,m15,RIPLEY,HOW MUCH TIME?
5913,L26808,u229,m15,BISHOP,See you soon.
5914,L26807,u237,m15,RIPLEY,It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
5915,L26803,u237,m15,RIPLEY,All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
5916,L26802,u229,m15,BISHOP,"I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid."
5917,L26801,u237,m15,RIPLEY,What?
5918,L26800,u229,m15,BISHOP,I'll go.
5919,L26789,u229,m15,BISHOP,"I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point."
5920,L26788,u237,m15,RIPLEY,And it's too late to shut it down?
5921,L26785,u229,m15,BISHOP,I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
5922,L26784,u237,m15,RIPLEY,How long until it blows?
5923,L26783,u229,m15,BISHOP,That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
5924,L26759,u229,m15,BISHOP,"Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course."
5925,L26758,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Could it be intelligent?
5926,L26757,u229,m15,BISHOP,"Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society."
5927,L26756,u237,m15,RIPLEY,You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
5928,L26755,u229,m15,BISHOP,"That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs."
5929,L26754,u237,m15,RIPLEY,But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
5930,L26753,u229,m15,BISHOP,Yes.  That follows.
5931,L26752,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least."
5932,L26751,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those..."
5933,L26750,u229,m15,BISHOP,I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
5934,L26774,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Sorry to disappoint you.
5935,L26773,u230,m15,BURKE,"I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this."
5936,L26770,u230,m15,BURKE,"Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing."
5937,L26769,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?"
5938,L26768,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J."
5939,L26767,u230,m15,BURKE,"Now, wait a second --"
5940,L26766,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --"
5941,L26765,u230,m15,BURKE,"You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it."
5942,L26764,u237,m15,RIPLEY,You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
5943,L26763,u230,m15,BURKE,"Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life."
5944,L26682,u237,m15,RIPLEY,This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
5945,L26681,u230,m15,BURKE,Corporal Hicks!?
5946,L26680,u237,m15,RIPLEY,What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
5947,L26679,u230,m15,BURKE,"Don't make me pull rank, Ripley."
5948,L26678,u237,m15,RIPLEY,You son of a bitch.
5949,L26673,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Bullshit!
5950,L26672,u230,m15,BURKE,This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
5951,L26671,u237,m15,RIPLEY,They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
5952,L26670,u230,m15,BURKE,"Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --"
5953,L26669,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Why not?
5954,L26668,u230,m15,BURKE,Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
5955,L26667,u237,m15,RIPLEY,No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
5956,L26597,u230,m15,BURKE,She's right.
5957,L26596,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system."
5958,L26595,u230,m15,BURKE,"Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built..."
5959,L26594,u237,m15,RIPLEY,They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
5960,L26476,u230,m15,BURKE,"Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way."
5961,L26475,u237,m15,RIPLEY,That the atmosphere processor?
5962,L26442,u230,m15,BURKE,I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
5963,L26441,u237,m15,RIPLEY,I hope you're right.  I really do.
5964,L26408,u230,m15,BURKE,"Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board."
5965,L26407,u237,m15,RIPLEY,You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
5966,L26378,u230,m15,BURKE,That's the plan.  My word on it.
5967,L26377,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever."
5968,L26376,u230,m15,BURKE,"Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi..."
5969,L26374,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you."
5970,L26373,u230,m15,BURKE,"Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over..."
5971,L26372,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month."
5972,L26371,u230,m15,BURKE,"If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse..."
5973,L26370,u237,m15,RIPLEY,If I go.
5974,L26369,u230,m15,BURKE,What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
5975,L26368,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse."
5976,L26367,u230,m15,BURKE,"Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?"
5977,L26366,u237,m15,RIPLEY,That's right.
5978,L26365,u230,m15,BURKE,I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
5979,L26364,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial."
5980,L26363,u230,m15,BURKE,"Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'"
5981,L26362,u237,m15,RIPLEY,What about you?  What's your interest in this?
5982,L26357,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it."
5983,L26356,u230,m15,BURKE,Hear me out...
5984,L26355,u237,m15,RIPLEY,No.  There's no way!
5985,L26309,u230,m15,BURKE,You are a head case.  Have a donut.
5986,L26308,u237,m15,RIPLEY,They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
5987,L26307,u230,m15,BURKE,"You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo."
5988,L26287,u230,m15,BURKE,Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
5989,L26286,u237,m15,RIPLEY,I get the picture.
5990,L26285,u230,m15,BURKE,"Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys..."
5991,L26284,u237,m15,RIPLEY,You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
5992,L26280,u230,m15,BURKE,"Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children."
5993,L26279,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Amy.
5994,L26278,u230,m15,BURKE,"Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry."
5995,L26277,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Is she...?
5996,L26276,u230,m15,BURKE,"Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest..."
5997,L26275,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Have they located my daughter yet?
5998,L26266,u230,m15,BURKE,You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
5999,L26265,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Fifty-seven...oh, Christ..."
6000,L26602,u231,m15,GORMAN,"Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there."
6001,L26601,u230,m15,BURKE,We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
6002,L26550,u231,m15,GORMAN,PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
6003,L26549,u230,m15,BURKE,What's he scanning for?
6004,L26513,u230,m15,BURKE,It's insured.
6005,L26512,u231,m15,GORMAN,Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
6006,L26448,u231,m15,GORMAN,Dead on all channels.
6007,L26447,u230,m15,BURKE,Still nothing from the colony?
6008,L26361,u231,m15,GORMAN,We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
6009,L26360,u230,m15,BURKE,"These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?"
6010,L26359,u231,m15,GORMAN,You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
6011,L26358,u230,m15,BURKE,"Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all."
6012,L26836,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Forget it.
6013,L26835,u231,m15,GORMAN,"All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I..."
6014,L26834,u237,m15,RIPLEY,How do you feel?
6015,L26639,u237,m15,RIPLEY,They're but off!  Do something!
6016,L26638,u231,m15,GORMAN,I told them to fall back...
6017,L26630,u231,m15,GORMAN,Shut up.  Just shut up!
6018,L26629,u237,m15,RIPLEY,GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
6019,L26600,u231,m15,GORMAN,So?  So?
6020,L26599,u237,m15,RIPLEY,So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
6021,L26598,u231,m15,GORMAN,So.
6022,L26587,u231,m15,GORMAN,Proceed inside.
6023,L26586,u237,m15,RIPLEY,I don't know.
6024,L26585,u231,m15,GORMAN,What is it?
6025,L26541,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
6026,L26540,u231,m15,GORMAN,Where are your parents?  You have to try...
6027,L26528,u231,m15,GORMAN,Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
6028,L26527,u237,m15,RIPLEY,One of us?
6029,L26478,u237,m15,RIPLEY,The structure seems intact.  They have power.
6030,L26477,u231,m15,GORMAN,Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
6031,L26468,u231,m15,GORMAN,Thirty-eight...simulated.
6032,L26467,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?"
6033,L26584,u233,m15,HUDSON,You tell me.  I only work here.
6034,L26583,u231,m15,GORMAN,We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
6035,L26573,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower."
6036,L26572,u231,m15,GORMAN,Alive?
6037,L26571,u233,m15,HUDSON,Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
6038,L26507,u231,m15,GORMAN,"Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go."
6039,L26506,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Sir, the CPU is on-line."
6040,L26504,u233,m15,HUDSON,He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
6041,L26503,u231,m15,GORMAN,...We're coming in.
6042,L26502,u231,m15,GORMAN,"All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower..."
6043,L26444,u233,m15,HUDSON,How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
6044,L26443,u231,m15,GORMAN,Are there any questions?  Hudson?
6045,L26423,u231,m15,GORMAN,All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
6046,L26422,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?"
6047,L26421,u231,m15,GORMAN,What's the question?
6048,L26420,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks."
6049,L26419,u231,m15,GORMAN,"Yes, Hicks?"
6050,L26418,u233,m15,HUDSON,Sir?
6051,L26417,u231,m15,GORMAN,At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
6052,L26900,u232,m15,HICKS,Fuckin' A!
6053,L26899,u233,m15,HUDSON,Let's go!  Let's go!
6054,L26895,u233,m15,HUDSON,Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
6055,L26894,u232,m15,HICKS,Well you're not reading it right!
6056,L26884,u232,m15,HICKS,Let's get these things lit.
6057,L26883,u233,m15,HUDSON,Seventeen meters.
6058,L26854,u233,m15,HUDSON,Do it!
6059,L26853,u232,m15,HICKS,The corner!  Ready?
6060,L26819,u232,m15,HICKS,I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
6061,L26818,u233,m15,HUDSON,Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
6062,L26787,u233,m15,HUDSON,I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
6063,L26786,u232,m15,HICKS,We got problems.
6064,L26716,u233,m15,HUDSON,Aye-firmative.
6065,L26715,u232,m15,HICKS,"Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose."
6066,L26694,u232,m15,HICKS,Are you finished?  You okay?
6067,L26693,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!"
6068,L26627,u232,m15,HICKS,"Not that tunnel, the other one!"
6069,L26626,u233,m15,HUDSON,Let's get the fuck out of here!
6070,L26460,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Sure, Hicks."
6071,L26459,u232,m15,HICKS,Save it.
6072,L26951,u232,m15,HICKS,"Don't be long, Ellen."
6073,L26950,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Ellen.
6074,L26947,u232,m15,HICKS,We ain't going anywhere.
6075,L26946,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Hicks, don't let him leave."
6076,L26938,u232,m15,HICKS,All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
6077,L26937,u237,m15,RIPLEY,No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
6078,L26903,u232,m15,HICKS,Stand back.
6079,L26902,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Locked.
6080,L26886,u232,m15,HICKS,We didn't miss anything.
6081,L26885,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed."
6082,L26877,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations."
6083,L26876,u232,m15,HICKS,It's game time.
6084,L26864,u232,m15,HICKS,Let's waste him.  No offense.
6085,L26863,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage."
6086,L26860,u237,m15,RIPLEY,The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
6087,L26859,u232,m15,HICKS,Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
6088,L26833,u232,m15,HICKS,Yeah.  I've noticed.
6089,L26832,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself."
6090,L26831,u232,m15,HICKS,"Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that."
6091,L26830,u237,m15,RIPLEY,What's this?
6092,L26824,u232,m15,HICKS,"If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine."
6093,L26823,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?"
6094,L26822,u232,m15,HICKS,Maybe.  Maybe not.
6095,L26821,u237,m15,RIPLEY,They'll get us.
6096,L26817,u237,m15,RIPLEY,But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
6097,L26816,u232,m15,HICKS,Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
6098,L26813,u232,m15,HICKS,Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
6099,L26812,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Now many?
6100,L26810,u237,m15,RIPLEY,On my way.
6101,L26809,u232,m15,HICKS,They're in the approach corridor.
6102,L26714,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here."
6103,L26713,u232,m15,HICKS,We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
6104,L26712,u237,m15,RIPLEY,All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
6105,L26703,u232,m15,HICKS,About seventeen days.
6106,L26702,u237,m15,RIPLEY,How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
6107,L26525,u232,m15,HICKS,Poor bastard.
6108,L26524,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off."
6109,L26873,u233,m15,HUDSON,No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
6110,L26872,u240,m15,VASQUEZ,You're just reading me.
6111,L26871,u233,m15,HUDSON,It's inside the complex.
6112,L26791,u240,m15,VASQUEZ,"Hudson, give us a break."
6113,L26790,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!"
6114,L26675,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!"
6115,L26674,u240,m15,VASQUEZ,"Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us."
6116,L26666,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?"
6117,L26665,u240,m15,VASQUEZ,"All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?"
6118,L26439,u233,m15,HUDSON,Anytime.  Anywhere.
6119,L26438,u240,m15,VASQUEZ,Fuck you.
6120,L26437,u233,m15,HUDSON,Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
6121,L26389,u240,m15,VASQUEZ,No.  Have you?
6122,L26388,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?"
6123,L26893,u233,m15,HUDSON,It's readin' right.  Look!
6124,L26892,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Can't be.  That's inside the room!
6125,L26891,u233,m15,HUDSON,Nine meters.  Eight.
6126,L26890,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?"
6127,L26889,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters."
6128,L26888,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!"
6129,L26887,u233,m15,HUDSON,Fifteen meters.
6130,L26882,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Seal the door.
6131,L26881,u233,m15,HUDSON,Range twenty meters.
6132,L26879,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Just get back here!
6133,L26878,u233,m15,HUDSON,This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
6134,L26867,u233,m15,HUDSON,"What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals."
6135,L26866,u237,m15,RIPLEY,They cut the power.
6136,L26799,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way."
6137,L26798,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
6138,L26796,u237,m15,RIPLEY,What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
6139,L26795,u233,m15,HUDSON,Think of what?  We're fucked.
6140,L26794,u237,m15,RIPLEY,I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
6141,L26793,u233,m15,HUDSON,How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
6142,L26792,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow."
6143,L26724,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Uh, what's next?"
6144,L26723,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Thanks.
6145,L26711,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here."
6146,L26710,u237,m15,RIPLEY,This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
6147,L26705,u237,m15,RIPLEY,She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
6148,L26704,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before..."
6149,L26663,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening."
6150,L26662,u237,m15,RIPLEY,You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
6151,L26660,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man."
6152,L26659,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Looks like it stung him.
6153,L26431,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --"
6154,L26430,u233,m15,HUDSON,"Sounds like you, Hicks."
6155,L26326,u238,m15,SIMPSON,"Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his."
6156,L26325,u234,m15,LYDECKER,So what do I tell this guy?
6157,L26324,u238,m15,SIMPSON,"Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'"
6158,L26323,u234,m15,LYDECKER,"There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored."
6159,L26322,u238,m15,SIMPSON,Yeah.  What?
6160,L26321,u234,m15,LYDECKER,"You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?"
6161,L26271,u237,m15,RIPLEY,No.. I've slept enough.
6162,L26270,u235,m15,MED-TECH,Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
6163,L26257,u235,m15,MED-TECH,Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
6164,L26256,u237,m15,RIPLEY,How long have I been on Gateway station?
6165,L26255,u235,m15,MED-TECH,Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
6166,L26254,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Terrible.
6167,L26253,u235,m15,MED-TECH,And how are we today?
6168,L26983,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Yes, honey.  I think we both can."
6169,L26982,u236,m15,NEWT,Can we dream?
6170,L26981,u237,m15,RIPLEY,That's right.
6171,L26980,u236,m15,NEWT,Are we going to sleep now?
6172,L26979,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Right here, baby.  Right here."
6173,L26978,u236,m15,NEWT,Mommy...Mommy?
6174,L26957,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight."
6175,L26956,u236,m15,NEWT,I knew you'd come.
6176,L26922,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Newt, wait!"
6177,L26921,u236,m15,NEWT,"This way.  Come on, we're almost there!"
6178,L26912,u236,m15,NEWT,Sure.  Go left.
6179,L26911,u237,m15,RIPLEY,DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
6180,L26910,u236,m15,NEWT,Come on.  Crawl faster.
6181,L26898,u236,m15,NEWT,Look!
6182,L26897,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Burke!  Open the door!
6183,L26851,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"I know, honey.  Me too."
6184,L26850,u236,m15,NEWT,"Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared."
6185,L26844,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
6186,L26843,u236,m15,NEWT,Wah...?  Where are...?
6187,L26842,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Newt.  Newt, wake up."
6188,L26747,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there."
6189,L26746,u236,m15,NEWT,Don't go!  Please.
6190,L26743,u236,m15,NEWT,You mean dead.
6191,L26742,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Gone.
6192,L26741,u236,m15,NEWT,Where is she?
6193,L26740,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Yes.  A little girl.
6194,L26739,u236,m15,NEWT,Did you ever have a baby?
6195,L26738,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"No, it's different, honey."
6196,L26737,u236,m15,NEWT,Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
6197,L26736,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth."
6198,L26735,u236,m15,NEWT,Did one of those things grow inside her?
6199,L26734,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Well, some kids can't handle it like you can."
6200,L26733,u236,m15,NEWT,Why do they tell little kids that?
6201,L26732,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Yes, there are, aren't there."
6202,L26731,u236,m15,NEWT,My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
6203,L26730,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Oh.  Sorry, Newt."
6204,L26729,u236,m15,NEWT,Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
6205,L26726,u236,m15,NEWT,I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
6206,L26725,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
6207,L26697,u236,m15,NEWT,You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
6208,L26696,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"I'm sorry, Newt."
6209,L26695,u236,m15,NEWT,"I guess we're not leaving, right?"
6210,L26580,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"You're really something, ace."
6211,L26579,u236,m15,NEWT,"Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody."
6212,L26578,u237,m15,RIPLEY,The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
6213,L26577,u236,m15,NEWT,I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
6214,L26569,u236,m15,NEWT,And hope to die?
6215,L26568,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Cross my heart.
6216,L26567,u236,m15,NEWT,You promise?
6217,L26566,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
6218,L26565,u236,m15,NEWT,They're dead.
6219,L26564,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would."
6220,L26562,u236,m15,NEWT,"Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone."
6221,L26561,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Why not?
6222,L26560,u236,m15,NEWT,I don't want you for a friend.
6223,L26559,u237,m15,RIPLEY,What about me?
6224,L26558,u236,m15,NEWT,Casey.  She's my only friend.
6225,L26555,u236,m15,NEWT,Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
6226,L26554,u237,m15,RIPLEY,What did you say?
6227,L26318,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Sweet Jesus.
6228,L26317,u239,m15,VAN LEUWEN,"Sixty, maybe seventy families."
6229,L26316,u237,m15,RIPLEY,How many colonists?
6230,L26314,u237,m15,RIPLEY,What are you talking about. What people?
6231,L26313,u239,m15,VAN LEUWEN,"Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now."
6232,L26312,u237,m15,RIPLEY,Why won't you check out LV-426?
6233,L26304,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching..."
6234,L26303,u239,m15,VAN LEUWEN,"Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be..."
6235,L26302,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise..."
6236,L26297,u237,m15,RIPLEY,That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
6237,L26296,u239,m15,VAN LEUWEN,The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
6238,L26293,u239,m15,VAN LEUWEN,"It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up."
6239,L26292,u237,m15,RIPLEY,"Look, I told you..."
6240,L31167,u241,m16,ALLEGRO,"At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!"
6241,L31166,u242,m16,ANDANTE,"A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish."
6242,L31165,u241,m16,ALLEGRO,"I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!"
6243,L31164,u242,m16,ANDANTE,"A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish."
6244,L31163,u241,m16,ALLEGRO,Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
6245,L31162,u242,m16,ANDANTE,"A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!"
6246,L30091,u255,m16,MOZART,What do you mean?
6247,L30090,u243,m16,ARCO,His Grace is very angry with you.
6248,L30089,u255,m16,MOZART,These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
6249,L30088,u243,m16,ARCO,Indeed.
6250,L30087,u255,m16,MOZART,"Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?"
6251,L30086,u255,m16,MOZART,Certainly!
6252,L30085,u243,m16,ARCO,"Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word."
6253,L30321,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,Meaning you didn't like it.
6254,L30320,u260,m16,SALIERI,Extremely clever.
6255,L30319,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,What did you think of the music?
6256,L30318,u260,m16,SALIERI,You were sublime.
6257,L30317,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,How was I? Tell me honestly.
6258,L30316,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
6259,L30315,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Well, what does it matter to you?"
6260,L30314,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,The marriage!
6261,L30313,u260,m16,SALIERI,What?
6262,L30312,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,Did you know? Had you heard?
6263,L30251,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,"Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste."
6264,L30250,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina."
6265,L30249,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,Why?
6266,L30248,u260,m16,SALIERI,You might be disappointed.
6267,L30247,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,What does he look like?
6268,L30246,u260,m16,SALIERI,Perhaps.
6269,L30245,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
6270,L30244,u260,m16,SALIERI,"My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk."
6271,L30243,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,"Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it."
6272,L30242,u260,m16,SALIERI,A Turkish brothel.
6273,L30241,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,Oh!
6274,L30240,u260,m16,SALIERI,A brothel.
6275,L30239,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,What's that?
6276,L30238,u260,m16,SALIERI,In a harem.
6277,L30237,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,Where?
6278,L30236,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?"
6279,L30235,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,Why not?
6280,L30234,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one."
6281,L30233,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,How do you know?
6282,L30232,u260,m16,SALIERI,No.
6283,L30231,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,Is there a part for me?
6284,L30230,u260,m16,SALIERI,Yes.
6285,L30229,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
6286,L30228,u260,m16,SALIERI,Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
6287,L30227,u244,m16,CAVALIERI,"Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart."
6288,L30226,u260,m16,SALIERI,Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.

6490,L30441,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals."
6491,L30440,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like."
6492,L30439,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband."
6493,L30438,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"Thank you very much, Your Excellency."
6494,L30434,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!"
6495,L30433,u260,m16,SALIERI,I see.
6496,L30432,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"No, sir. This is my own idea."
6497,L30431,u260,m16,SALIERI,Then he didn't send you?
6498,L30430,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come."
6499,L30429,u260,m16,SALIERI,Really?
6500,L30428,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here."
6501,L30427,u260,m16,SALIERI,I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
6502,L30426,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait."
6503,L30425,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest."
6504,L30424,u260,m16,SALIERI,I understand.
6505,L30423,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"He's terribly busy, sir."
6506,L30422,u260,m16,SALIERI,How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
6507,L30421,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment."
6508,L30420,u260,m16,SALIERI,Frau Mozart?
6509,L30419,u260,m16,SALIERI,Madame. How can I help you?
6510,L30418,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,Excellency!
6511,L31115,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?"
6512,L31114,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi."
6513,L31113,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,Money! Money!
6514,L31112,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
6515,L31111,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!"
6516,L31110,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
6517,L31109,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,He's doing his best.
6518,L31108,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
6519,L31107,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,Leave him alone!
6520,L31106,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?"
6521,L31085,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,I hope so. I need it immediately.
6522,L31084,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
6523,L31083,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Where's our friend?
6524,L31082,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,Not at all.
6525,L31081,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Am I interrupting something?
6526,L31017,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?"
6527,L31016,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,How much will you pay him?
6528,L30740,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,Do you hear him? Do you?
6529,L30739,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
6530,L30738,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!"
6531,L30737,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
6532,L30736,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
6533,L30723,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?"
6534,L30722,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
6535,L30721,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
6536,L30659,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,In three months! Papa.
6537,L30658,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,"When, may I ask?"
6538,L30657,u247,m16,CONSTANZE,"Oh, yes."
6539,L30656,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,I see that you're expecting.
6540,L30998,u263,m16,SECOND LADY,Behold!
6541,L30997,u248,m16,FIRST LADY,Behold!
6542,L30991,u263,m16,SECOND LADY,Hey!
6543,L30990,u248,m16,FIRST LADY,Hey!
6544,L30976,u263,m16,SECOND LADY,Behold!
6545,L30975,u248,m16,FIRST LADY,Behold!
6546,L30963,u263,m16,SECOND LADY,Adorable!
6547,L30962,u248,m16,FIRST LADY,He's adorable!
6548,L30957,u263,m16,SECOND LADY,Be careful!
6549,L30956,u248,m16,FIRST LADY,Be careful!
6550,L30268,u254,m16,MADAME WEBER,"Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!"
6551,L30267,u249,m16,FLUNKY,"I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass."
6552,L30264,u254,m16,MADAME WEBER,Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
6553,L30263,u249,m16,FLUNKY,"I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders."
6554,L30262,u254,m16,MADAME WEBER,Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
6555,L30261,u249,m16,FLUNKY,"I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted."
6556,L30260,u254,m16,MADAME WEBER,"Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor."
6557,L30617,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,Yes. He is a little strange.
6558,L30616,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,What a strange young man.
6559,L30606,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,Michael!
6560,L30605,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,I said play!
6561,L30582,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,"Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning."
6562,L30581,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so."
6563,L30580,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,"It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude."
6564,L30579,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,Gertrude!
6565,L30578,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
6566,L30575,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,You can't be Herr Mozart!
6567,L30574,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,Gertrude!
6568,L30573,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,Upstairs.
6569,L30602,u255,m16,MOZART,"Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know."
6570,L30601,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
6571,L30600,u255,m16,MOZART,Who was your teacher?
6572,L30599,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,Just one year.
6573,L30589,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,Wine?
6574,L30588,u255,m16,MOZART,"I'd like a little wine, if you have it."
6575,L30587,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,"Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?"
6576,L30584,u250,m16,FRAU SCHLUMBERG,"Ah, now! Here she comes."
6577,L30583,u255,m16,MOZART,Really?
6578,L30889,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Well, look at them."
6579,L30888,u260,m16,SALIERI,"It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid."
6580,L30887,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Do you like this, Salieri?"
6581,L30521,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson."
6582,L30520,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Yes?
6583,L30519,u260,m16,SALIERI,"As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!"
6584,L30518,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Really?
6585,L30517,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies."
6586,L30516,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Of course not.
6587,L30515,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician."
6588,L30514,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Oh?
6589,L30513,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming."
6590,L30512,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Why not?
6591,L30511,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart."
6592,L30510,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"I don't think you understand me, Court Composer."
6593,L30378,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Well. There it is.
6594,L30377,u260,m16,SALIERI,Sire.
6595,L30376,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea."
6596,L30375,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes."
6597,L30374,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
6598,L30373,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism."
6599,L30372,u251,m16,JOSEPH,And the result satisfies.
6600,L30371,u260,m16,SALIERI,You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
6601,L30370,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Yes?
6602,L30369,u260,m16,SALIERI,"An interesting idea, Majesty. But -"
6603,L30368,u251,m16,JOSEPH,I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
6604,L30367,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!"
6605,L30365,u260,m16,SALIERI,Your Highness.
6606,L30364,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth."
6607,L30204,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue."
6608,L30203,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn."
6609,L30202,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Well, I'm glad to hear that."
6610,L30179,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?"
6611,L30178,u260,m16,SALIERI,My pleasure.
6612,L30170,u260,m16,SALIERI,Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
6613,L30169,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri."
6614,L30156,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Ah-ha!
6615,L30155,u260,m16,SALIERI,"A-flat, Majesty."
6616,L30154,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice."
6617,L30153,u260,m16,SALIERI,"You do me too much honour, Sire."
6618,L30152,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?"
6619,L30151,u260,m16,SALIERI,Majesty.
6620,L30150,u251,m16,JOSEPH,May I try it?
6621,L30149,u260,m16,SALIERI,"It's just a trifle, of course."
6622,L30148,u251,m16,JOSEPH,What a charming idea. May I see?
6623,L30124,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him."
6624,L30123,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention."
6625,L30833,u255,m16,MOZART,"Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?"
6626,L30832,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade."
6627,L30831,u255,m16,MOZART,"Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not."
6628,L30821,u255,m16,MOZART,"Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives."
6629,L30820,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!"
6630,L30819,u255,m16,MOZART,"Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it."
6631,L30818,u251,m16,JOSEPH,I have no idea.
6632,L30817,u255,m16,MOZART,"But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?"
6633,L30816,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Ah, love again."
6634,L30815,u255,m16,MOZART,"But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love."
6635,L30814,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece."
6636,L30813,u255,m16,MOZART,"Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics."
6637,L30812,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here."
6638,L30809,u255,m16,MOZART,"Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy."
6639,L30808,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Would you tell me why?
6640,L30807,u255,m16,MOZART,"Well, yes, I admit it is."
6641,L30806,u251,m16,JOSEPH,It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
6642,L30805,u255,m16,MOZART,"Who told you this, Majesty?"
6643,L30804,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
6644,L30803,u255,m16,MOZART,"Yes, Sire."
6645,L30802,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?"
6646,L30768,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Ah! By all means.
6647,L30767,u255,m16,MOZART,May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
6648,L30766,u251,m16,JOSEPH,What is it?
6649,L30765,u255,m16,MOZART,"Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?"
6650,L30762,u255,m16,MOZART,"Thank you, Sire!"
6651,L30761,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man."
6652,L30296,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna."
6653,L30295,u255,m16,MOZART,Twenty-six.
6654,L30294,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Excuse me, but how old are you?"
6655,L30293,u255,m16,MOZART,"Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether."
6656,L30292,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
6657,L30290,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Enchanted, Madame."
6658,L30289,u255,m16,MOZART,"Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady."
6659,L30285,u255,m16,MOZART,"Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?"
6660,L30284,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect."
6661,L30281,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?"
6662,L30280,u255,m16,MOZART,"I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less."
6663,L30277,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?"
6664,L30276,u255,m16,MOZART,"What do you mean, Sire?"
6665,L30275,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
6666,L30274,u255,m16,MOZART,"So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?"
6667,L30273,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!"
6668,L30272,u255,m16,MOZART,And German?
6669,L30271,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Yes, indeed."
6670,L30270,u255,m16,MOZART,"It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?"
6671,L30213,u255,m16,MOZART,"I think so, Sire, yes."
6672,L30212,u251,m16,JOSEPH,What? On one hearing only?
6673,L30211,u255,m16,MOZART,"Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head."
6674,L30195,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Ah-ha.
6675,L30194,u255,m16,MOZART,"In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio."
6676,L30193,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Yes, where?"
6677,L30192,u255,m16,MOZART,"It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -"
6678,L30191,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Well, what is it about? Tell us the story."
6679,L30187,u255,m16,MOZART,Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
6680,L30186,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Why so?
6681,L30181,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
6682,L30180,u255,m16,MOZART,Majesty!
6683,L30177,u255,m16,MOZART,"Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!"
6684,L30176,u251,m16,JOSEPH,And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
6685,L30168,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely."
6686,L30167,u251,m16,JOSEPH,The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
6687,L30166,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh, thank you."
6688,L30162,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?"
6689,L30161,u255,m16,MOZART,Your Majesty!
6690,L30146,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
6691,L30145,u267,m16,VON STRACK,He's here.
6692,L30144,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Yes, what about him?"
6693,L30143,u267,m16,VON STRACK,"Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -"
6694,L30142,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Well, what do you have for me today?"
6695,L30126,u251,m16,JOSEPH,Well. There it is.
6696,L30125,u267,m16,VON STRACK,"Yes, sir."
6697,L30119,u267,m16,VON STRACK,"In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people."
6698,L30118,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?"
6699,L30115,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre."
6700,L30114,u267,m16,VON STRACK,"I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop."
6701,L30113,u251,m16,JOSEPH,"Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?"
6702,L30775,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,"Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'"
6703,L30774,u255,m16,MOZART,Father -
6704,L30735,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,She does. She says I sleep all day.
6705,L30734,u255,m16,MOZART,No one calls you that.
6706,L30733,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,"Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden."
6707,L30732,u255,m16,MOZART,Papa!
6708,L30731,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
6709,L30716,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
6710,L30715,u255,m16,MOZART,Are you playing a trick on me?
6711,L30714,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Mine?
6712,L30713,u255,m16,MOZART,"Papa, is this your idea?"
6713,L30683,u255,m16,MOZART,But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
6714,L30682,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
6715,L30679,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,"I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son."
6716,L30678,u255,m16,MOZART,"Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!"
6717,L30673,u255,m16,MOZART,"This is just a game, Papa."
6718,L30672,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,"No, really!"
6719,L30669,u255,m16,MOZART,"Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!"
6720,L30668,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
6721,L30662,u255,m16,MOZART,Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
6722,L30661,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
6723,L30660,u255,m16,MOZART,Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
6724,L30652,u255,m16,MOZART,"It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!"
6725,L30651,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,You don't have secrets from me.
6726,L30650,u255,m16,MOZART,It's a secret.
6727,L30649,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Why not?
6728,L30648,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh, let's not talk about it."
6729,L30647,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,What's that?
6730,L30646,u255,m16,MOZART,This one will.
6731,L30645,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
6732,L30644,u255,m16,MOZART,"I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition."
6733,L30643,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,How many?
6734,L30642,u255,m16,MOZART,Yes.
6735,L30641,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Yes.
6736,L30640,u255,m16,MOZART,Pupils?
6737,L30639,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,How many pupils do you have?
6738,L30638,u255,m16,MOZART,Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
6739,L30637,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,They say you're in debt.
6740,L30636,u255,m16,MOZART,"What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here."
6741,L30635,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,That's not what I hear.
6742,L30634,u255,m16,MOZART,It couldn't be better.
6743,L30633,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,How is your financial situation?
6744,L30632,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself."
6745,L30631,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Don't you have a maid?
6746,L30630,u255,m16,MOZART,"She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me."
6747,L30627,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see."
6748,L30626,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Do you always live like this?
6749,L30625,u255,m16,MOZART,I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
6750,L30624,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Is she not here?
6751,L30623,u255,m16,MOZART,"Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see."
6752,L30621,u255,m16,MOZART,"Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!"
6753,L30620,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,Am I not welcome?
6754,L30619,u255,m16,MOZART,Why are you here?
6755,L30359,u255,m16,MOZART,I will.
6756,L30358,u252,m16,LEOPOLD,"I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming."
6757,L31131,u260,m16,SALIERI,Are you sure it's an opera?
6758,L31130,u253,m16,LORL,"Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened."
6759,L31129,u260,m16,SALIERI,Opera? Opera!
6760,L31128,u253,m16,LORL,"I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera."
6761,L31127,u260,m16,SALIERI,Is he working?
6762,L31126,u253,m16,LORL,"I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead."
6763,L31125,u260,m16,SALIERI,Is he working?
6764,L31124,u253,m16,LORL,"Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over."
6765,L31123,u260,m16,SALIERI,Where?
6766,L31122,u253,m16,LORL,I don't know. He has pains.
6767,L31121,u260,m16,SALIERI,What medicine?
6768,L31120,u253,m16,LORL,"You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse."
6769,L31119,u260,m16,SALIERI,Why? What has happened?
6770,L31118,u253,m16,LORL,I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
6771,L31117,u260,m16,SALIERI,Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
6772,L30760,u253,m16,LORL,"In there, sir."
6773,L30759,u260,m16,SALIERI,Where does he work?
6774,L30757,u260,m16,SALIERI,Yes what?
6775,L30756,u253,m16,LORL,"I think I've found out about the money, sir."
6776,L30754,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?"
6777,L30753,u253,m16,LORL,"Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir."
6778,L30752,u260,m16,SALIERI,Really? What is it he's writing?
6779,L30751,u253,m16,LORL,"Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat."
6780,L30750,u260,m16,SALIERI,Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
6781,L30749,u253,m16,LORL,Not that I've seen.
6782,L30748,u260,m16,SALIERI,Do any pupils come to the house?
6783,L30747,u253,m16,LORL,"Oh, thank you, sir."
6784,L30222,u260,m16,SALIERI,Bene.
6785,L30221,u253,m16,LORL,"Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir."
6786,L30135,u260,m16,SALIERI,Bene! Bene!
6787,L30134,u253,m16,LORL,"Yes, thank you, sir."
6788,L30133,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?"
6789,L30132,u253,m16,LORL,"I will, sir."
6790,L30131,u260,m16,SALIERI,Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
6791,L30130,u260,m16,SALIERI,What have you got for me today? Let me see.
6792,L30129,u253,m16,LORL,"Good morning, sir."
6793,L30128,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning."
6794,L30712,u253,m16,LORL,Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
6795,L30711,u255,m16,MOZART,Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
6796,L30708,u253,m16,LORL,They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
6797,L30707,u255,m16,MOZART,What?
6798,L30706,u253,m16,LORL,"My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you."
6799,L30705,u255,m16,MOZART,That's right.
6800,L30704,u253,m16,LORL,Are you Herr Mozart?
6801,L30703,u255,m16,MOZART,Yes?
6802,L31104,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,So let me see it. Where is it?
6803,L31103,u255,m16,MOZART,"Well, we can."
6804,L31102,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes."
6805,L31101,u255,m16,MOZART,Because there's nothing to see.
6806,L31100,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Why not?
6807,L31099,u255,m16,MOZART,No.
6808,L31098,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Can I see it?
6809,L31097,u255,m16,MOZART,Yes.
6810,L31096,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?"
6811,L31095,u255,m16,MOZART,What?
6812,L31094,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
6813,L31093,u255,m16,MOZART,"Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you."
6814,L31092,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,What is this?
6815,L31091,u255,m16,MOZART,Put it down!
6816,L31090,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Wolfi!
6817,L31089,u255,m16,MOZART,Leave that alone!
6818,L31015,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,So there you are. What do you say?
6819,L31014,u255,m16,MOZART,"No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio."
6820,L31013,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
6821,L31012,u255,m16,MOZART,German!
6822,L31011,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German."
6823,L31010,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle."
6824,L31009,u255,m16,MOZART,Animals?
6825,L31008,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those."
6826,L31007,u255,m16,MOZART,I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
6827,L31006,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them."
6828,L31005,u255,m16,MOZART,I liked the horse.
6829,L31004,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"Yes, well, it's all good fun."
6830,L31003,u255,m16,MOZART,"Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?"
6831,L30920,u255,m16,MOZART,That kind of music should be punishable by death.
6832,L30919,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Sublime! Utterly sublime!
6833,L30918,u255,m16,MOZART,Well?
6834,L30681,u255,m16,MOZART,"Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room."
6835,L30680,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,What did he say? What did he say?
6836,L30496,u255,m16,MOZART,Sssh! Stay here.
6837,L30495,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
6838,L30494,u255,m16,MOZART,Sssh!
6839,L31043,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"My answer is no, Mozart."
6840,L31042,u255,m16,MOZART,"Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir."
6841,L31041,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,I'm sorry. No.
6842,L31040,u255,m16,MOZART,"No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours."
6843,L31039,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"Well, this is hardly the way to go about it."
6844,L31038,u255,m16,MOZART,"If a man cannot earn, he must borrow."
6845,L31037,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,What for?
6846,L31036,u255,m16,MOZART,"Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?"
6847,L31035,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?"
6848,L31034,u255,m16,MOZART,Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
6849,L31033,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man."
6850,L31032,u255,m16,MOZART,Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
6851,L31031,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
6852,L30615,u255,m16,MOZART,"Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!"
6853,L30614,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!"
6854,L30598,u255,m16,MOZART,"Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?"
6855,L30597,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?"
6856,L30586,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning."
6857,L30585,u255,m16,MOZART,"Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg."
6858,L30577,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?"
6859,L30576,u255,m16,MOZART,I'm afraid I am.
6860,L30572,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?"
6861,L30571,u255,m16,MOZART,Madame.
6862,L30570,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
6863,L30568,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way."
6864,L30567,u255,m16,MOZART,And which one of them do you want me to teach?
6865,L30566,u262,m16,SCHLUMBERG,"Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children."
6866,L31308,u255,m16,MOZART,I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
6867,L31307,u260,m16,SALIERI,What for?
6868,L31306,u255,m16,MOZART,I am so ashamed.
6869,L31305,u260,m16,SALIERI,I'm not leaving you.
6870,L31304,u255,m16,MOZART,Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
6871,L31303,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?"
6872,L31302,u255,m16,MOZART,We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
6873,L31301,u260,m16,SALIERI,Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
6874,L31300,u255,m16,MOZART,Do you want to rest a bit?
6875,L31299,u255,m16,MOZART,Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
6876,L31298,u260,m16,SALIERI,Yes.
6877,L31297,u255,m16,MOZART,Do you have it?
6878,L31296,u260,m16,SALIERI,You go fast!
6879,L31295,u255,m16,MOZART,And that's it. Do you have it?
6880,L31292,u260,m16,SALIERI,Yes!
6881,L31291,u255,m16,MOZART,"Yes, and on 'dictis'."
6882,L31290,u260,m16,SALIERI,Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
6883,L31289,u255,m16,MOZART,"C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis."
6884,L31288,u255,m16,MOZART,"Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed."
6885,L31287,u260,m16,SALIERI,That's wonderful!
6886,L31285,u255,m16,MOZART,Show me.
6887,L31284,u260,m16,SALIERI,I think so.
6888,L31283,u255,m16,MOZART,Do you have me?
6889,L31281,u255,m16,MOZART,Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
6890,L31280,u260,m16,SALIERI,And that's all?
6891,L31279,u255,m16,MOZART,"Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant."
6892,L31278,u260,m16,SALIERI,Also identical?
6893,L31277,u255,m16,MOZART,With the tenors.
6894,L31276,u260,m16,SALIERI,First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
6895,L31275,u255,m16,MOZART,It couldn't be simpler.
6896,L31274,u260,m16,SALIERI,Please! Just one moment.
6897,L31273,u255,m16,MOZART,Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
6898,L31272,u255,m16,MOZART,"Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis."
6899,L31271,u260,m16,SALIERI,Yes.
6900,L31270,u255,m16,MOZART,"Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?"
6901,L31269,u255,m16,MOZART,Sing it back.
6902,L31268,u260,m16,SALIERI,I think so.
6903,L31267,u255,m16,MOZART,"Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?"
6904,L31266,u260,m16,SALIERI,Yes.
6905,L31265,u255,m16,MOZART,"Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course."
6906,L31264,u255,m16,MOZART,Common time.
6907,L31263,u260,m16,SALIERI,What time?
6908,L31262,u255,m16,MOZART,The Fire.
6909,L31261,u255,m16,MOZART,So now - A minor. Suddenly.
6910,L31260,u260,m16,SALIERI,Yes.
6911,L31259,u255,m16,MOZART,We ended in F Major?
6912,L31258,u260,m16,SALIERI,Confutatis Maledictis.
6913,L31257,u260,m16,SALIERI,Come. Let's begin.
6914,L31256,u255,m16,MOZART,Strange!
6915,L31255,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Oh, yes."
6916,L31254,u255,m16,MOZART,A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
6917,L31253,u260,m16,SALIERI,What?
6918,L31252,u255,m16,MOZART,Do you believe in it?
6919,L31251,u260,m16,SALIERI,Consigned to flames of woe.
6920,L31250,u255,m16,MOZART,So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
6921,L31249,u260,m16,SALIERI,The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
6922,L31248,u255,m16,MOZART,Where did I stop?
6923,L31238,u255,m16,MOZART,A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
6924,L31237,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?"
6925,L31236,u255,m16,MOZART,"You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write."
6926,L31235,u260,m16,SALIERI,Of course.
6927,L31234,u255,m16,MOZART,But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
6928,L31233,u260,m16,SALIERI,"My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure."
6929,L31232,u255,m16,MOZART,"Would you? Actually, you could."
6930,L31231,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?"
6931,L31230,u255,m16,MOZART,Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
6932,L31211,u255,m16,MOZART,He knows. He knows!
6933,L31210,u260,m16,SALIERI,Finish what?
6934,L31209,u255,m16,MOZART,"Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it."
6935,L31207,u260,m16,SALIERI,What man?
6936,L31206,u255,m16,MOZART,The man. He's here.
6937,L31205,u260,m16,SALIERI,Who?
6938,L31204,u255,m16,MOZART,"No! No, it's him!"
6939,L31203,u260,m16,SALIERI,Shall I answer it?
6940,L31202,u255,m16,MOZART,I'm too young to be so sick.
6941,L31201,u260,m16,SALIERI,What?
6942,L31200,u255,m16,MOZART,The doctor thinks I am. But -
6943,L31199,u260,m16,SALIERI,Are you ill?
6944,L31198,u255,m16,MOZART,"I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things."
6945,L31197,u260,m16,SALIERI,I do.
6946,L31196,u255,m16,MOZART,Do you mean that?
6947,L31195,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me."
6948,L31194,u255,m16,MOZART,This is only a vaudeville.
6949,L31193,u260,m16,SALIERI,I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
6950,L31192,u255,m16,MOZART,I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
6951,L31191,u260,m16,SALIERI,"No, please."
6952,L31190,u255,m16,MOZART,You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
6953,L31189,u260,m16,SALIERI,You mean she's not coming back?
6954,L31188,u255,m16,MOZART,"Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa."
6955,L31187,u260,m16,SALIERI,Where is your wife?
6956,L31183,u255,m16,MOZART,"No, no. I have to get back. I have -"
6957,L31182,u260,m16,SALIERI,I'm taking you home. You're not well.
6958,L31181,u255,m16,MOZART,What happened? Is it over?
6959,L31134,u255,m16,MOZART,"No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!"
6960,L31133,u260,m16,SALIERI,Are you neglecting my request?
6961,L31132,u255,m16,MOZART,"I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time."
6962,L31062,u260,m16,SALIERI,Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
6963,L31061,u255,m16,MOZART,How long will you give me?
6964,L31059,u255,m16,MOZART,How much?
6965,L31058,u260,m16,SALIERI,I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
6966,L31057,u255,m16,MOZART,Who are you?
6967,L31056,u260,m16,SALIERI,A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
6968,L31055,u255,m16,MOZART,What dead? Who is dead?
6969,L31054,u260,m16,SALIERI,A Mass for the dead.
6970,L31053,u255,m16,MOZART,What work?
6971,L31052,u260,m16,SALIERI,I have come to commission work from you.
6972,L30929,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!"
6973,L30928,u260,m16,SALIERI,You flatter me.
6974,L30927,u255,m16,MOZART,I never knew that music like that was possible.
6975,L30926,u260,m16,SALIERI,Yes?
6976,L30925,u255,m16,MOZART,"How could it not, Excellency?"
6977,L30924,u260,m16,SALIERI,Did my work please you?
6978,L30923,u255,m16,MOZART,How could I not?
6979,L30922,u260,m16,SALIERI,Mozart. It was good of you to come.
6980,L30915,u255,m16,MOZART,"Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!"
6981,L30914,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!"
6982,L30913,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh no, the honour would be all mine."
6983,L30912,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me."
6984,L30911,u255,m16,MOZART,"I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that."
6985,L30910,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?"
6986,L30909,u255,m16,MOZART,It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
6987,L30908,u260,m16,SALIERI,I think it's marvelous. Truly.
6988,L30907,u255,m16,MOZART,What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
6989,L30906,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four."
6990,L30905,u255,m16,MOZART,But what is it they don't like?
6991,L30904,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully."
6992,L30903,u255,m16,MOZART,Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
6993,L30880,u255,m16,MOZART,"Thank you! Oh, thank you."
6994,L30879,u260,m16,SALIERI,"With all my heart, Mozart."
6995,L30878,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh, Excellency, would you?"
6996,L30877,u260,m16,SALIERI,But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
6997,L30876,u255,m16,MOZART,It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
6998,L30875,u260,m16,SALIERI,How fortunate.
6999,L30874,u255,m16,MOZART,Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
7000,L30873,u260,m16,SALIERI,You burned the score?
7001,L30872,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!"
7002,L30871,u260,m16,SALIERI,Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
7003,L30870,u255,m16,MOZART,"I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?"
7004,L30869,u260,m16,SALIERI,Really? Why?
7005,L30868,u255,m16,MOZART,It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
7006,L30867,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?"
7007,L30565,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?"
7008,L30564,u255,m16,MOZART,I can't say. Really
7009,L30563,u260,m16,SALIERI,What exactly are you working on?
7010,L30562,u255,m16,MOZART,"Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?"
7011,L30561,u260,m16,SALIERI,Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
7012,L30560,u255,m16,MOZART,Ah. Italian?
7013,L30559,u260,m16,SALIERI,Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
7014,L30558,u255,m16,MOZART,"Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?"
7015,L30557,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly."
7016,L30556,u255,m16,MOZART,I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
7017,L30555,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Ah, how exciting! Tell me more."
7018,L30554,u255,m16,MOZART,"Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!"
7019,L30553,u260,m16,SALIERI,I'm afraid not.
7020,L30552,u255,m16,MOZART,Do you have a daughter?
7021,L30551,u260,m16,SALIERI,Of course not.
7022,L30550,u255,m16,MOZART,"They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!"
7023,L30549,u260,m16,SALIERI,"How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful."
7024,L30548,u255,m16,MOZART,"How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!"
7025,L30547,u260,m16,SALIERI,"It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means."
7026,L30546,u255,m16,MOZART,"No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why."
7027,L30545,u260,m16,SALIERI,You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
7028,L30544,u255,m16,MOZART,"Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage."
7029,L30543,u260,m16,SALIERI,"An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth."
7030,L30542,u255,m16,MOZART,"But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!"
7031,L30541,u260,m16,SALIERI,"No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity."
7032,L30540,u255,m16,MOZART,Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
7033,L30539,u260,m16,SALIERI,Herr Sommer.
7034,L30538,u255,m16,MOZART,Whom did they choose?
7035,L30537,u260,m16,SALIERI,"My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late."
7036,L30536,u255,m16,MOZART,"Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!"
7037,L30535,u260,m16,SALIERI,I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
7038,L30534,u255,m16,MOZART,Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
7039,L30533,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't."
7040,L30532,u255,m16,MOZART,"So you see, this post is very important to me right now."
7041,L30531,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course."
7042,L30530,u255,m16,MOZART,"She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know."
7043,L30529,u260,m16,SALIERI,So you are. How is your pretty wife?
7044,L30528,u255,m16,MOZART,"Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now."
7045,L30527,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Herr Mozart, what brings you here?"
7046,L30329,u255,m16,MOZART,It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
7047,L30328,u260,m16,SALIERI,How could I not?
7048,L30327,u255,m16,MOZART,"Did you like it, then?"
7049,L30326,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations."
7050,L30283,u255,m16,MOZART,But this is absurd!
7051,L30282,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty."
7052,L30206,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that."
7053,L30205,u255,m16,MOZART,"Love, Sire!"
7054,L30175,u255,m16,MOZART,"A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things."
7055,L30174,u260,m16,SALIERI,Ah!
7056,L30173,u255,m16,MOZART,Mio caro Adone.
7057,L30172,u260,m16,SALIERI,Really?
7058,L30171,u255,m16,MOZART,"I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?"
7059,L30895,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!"
7060,L30894,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"Can we see the scene with the music back, please?"
7061,L30864,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,Taking out what you should never have put in.
7062,L30863,u255,m16,MOZART,"What are you doing, Herr Director?"
7063,L30860,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please."
7064,L30859,u255,m16,MOZART,But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
7065,L30858,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,Exactly. A dance.
7066,L30857,u255,m16,MOZART,"Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding."
7067,L30856,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
7068,L30854,u255,m16,MOZART,"Certainly, Herr Director."
7069,L30853,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away."
7070,L30837,u255,m16,MOZART,Just let me tell you how it begins.
7071,L30836,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"That will do, Herr Mozart!"
7072,L30811,u255,m16,MOZART,"But, Your Majesty -"
7073,L30810,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts."
7074,L30199,u255,m16,MOZART,"Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care."
7075,L30198,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,Then why especially does it have to be in German?
7076,L30197,u255,m16,MOZART,Exactly.
7077,L30196,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,You mean in Turkey?
7078,L30190,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,I think you'd better.
7079,L30189,u255,m16,MOZART,"I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately."
7080,L30188,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,Oh? Have I seen it?
7081,L30839,u255,m16,MOZART,"May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?"
7082,L30838,u267,m16,VON STRACK,Herr Mozart -
7083,L30397,u255,m16,MOZART,"Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!"
7084,L30396,u267,m16,VON STRACK,"Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues."
7085,L30395,u255,m16,MOZART,Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
7086,L30394,u267,m16,VON STRACK,Mozart -
7087,L30393,u255,m16,MOZART,"They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid."
7088,L30392,u267,m16,VON STRACK,Mozart -
7089,L30391,u255,m16,MOZART,"Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!"
7090,L30390,u267,m16,VON STRACK,"Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri."
7091,L30389,u255,m16,MOZART,Who is on this committee?
7092,L30388,u267,m16,VON STRACK,A little modesty would suit you better.
7093,L30387,u255,m16,MOZART,"No, but I'm the best."
7094,L30386,u267,m16,VON STRACK,"Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna."
7095,L30385,u255,m16,MOZART,Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
7096,L30384,u267,m16,VON STRACK,On the contrary.
7097,L30383,u255,m16,MOZART,Is the Emperor angry with me?
7098,L30382,u267,m16,VON STRACK,Because His Majesty wishes it.
7099,L30381,u255,m16,MOZART,Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
7100,L30380,u267,m16,VON STRACK,What is what?
7101,L30379,u255,m16,MOZART,"What is this, Herr Chamberlain?"
7102,L30826,u268,m16,VON SWIETEN,"Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty."
7103,L30825,u255,m16,MOZART,"Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?"
7104,L30824,u268,m16,VON SWIETEN,"Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?"
7105,L30823,u255,m16,MOZART,"Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?"
7106,L30822,u268,m16,VON SWIETEN,Mozart -
7107,L30764,u255,m16,MOZART,Baron!
7108,L30763,u268,m16,VON SWIETEN,"Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine."
7109,L30201,u255,m16,MOZART,"Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!"
7110,L30200,u268,m16,VON SWIETEN,"My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?"
7111,L30185,u255,m16,MOZART,"Oh, German! German! Please let it be German."
7112,L30184,u268,m16,VON SWIETEN,"I don't think it was really decided, Director."
7113,L31341,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,"Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute."
7114,L31340,u266,m16,VOGLER,"Oh my son, my poor son!"
7115,L31339,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,"No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!"
7116,L31338,u266,m16,VOGLER,"My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?"
7117,L31337,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,What difference does that make?
7118,L31336,u266,m16,VOGLER,But not his body.
7119,L31335,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,I poisoned his life.
7120,L31334,u266,m16,VOGLER,"No, you didn't!"
7121,L31333,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,I did.
7122,L31332,u266,m16,VOGLER,Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
7123,L31076,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,"The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands."
7124,L31075,u266,m16,VOGLER,Yes.
7125,L31074,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,"His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?"
7126,L31073,u266,m16,VOGLER,What?
7127,L30474,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,"Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture."
7128,L30473,u266,m16,VOGLER,I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
7129,L30472,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
7130,L30471,u266,m16,VOGLER,"My son, no one can speak for God."
7131,L30470,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,"All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!"
7132,L30469,u266,m16,VOGLER,God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
7133,L30468,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,No? Was Mozart a good man?
7134,L30467,u266,m16,VOGLER,You cannot say that!
7135,L30466,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,"Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God."
7136,L30342,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
7137,L30341,u266,m16,VOGLER,Did you try?
7138,L30340,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,"It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them."
7139,L30029,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,"He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered."
7140,L30028,u266,m16,VOGLER,Do you hear me?
7141,L30026,u266,m16,VOGLER,Should I?
7142,L30025,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,Do you believe it?
7143,L30024,u266,m16,VOGLER,Is it true?
7144,L30023,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,And do they believe it?
7145,L30022,u266,m16,VOGLER,All Vienna has heard that.
7146,L30021,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,Ah - you've heard that?
7147,L30020,u266,m16,VOGLER,Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
7148,L30019,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
7149,L30018,u266,m16,VOGLER,"Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that."
7150,L30017,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
7151,L30016,u266,m16,VOGLER,I regret it is not too familiar.
7152,L30015,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,Well?
7153,L30013,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
7154,L30012,u266,m16,VOGLER,I can't say I do. What is it?
7155,L30011,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,Then you must know this.
7156,L30010,u266,m16,VOGLER,Here in Vienna.
7157,L30009,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,Where?
7158,L30008,u266,m16,VOGLER,I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
7159,L30007,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,How well are you trained in music?
7160,L30006,u266,m16,VOGLER,"My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me."
7161,L30005,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,I do not seek forgiveness.
7162,L30004,u266,m16,VOGLER,Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
7163,L30003,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,Are they?
7164,L30002,u266,m16,VOGLER,That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
7165,L30001,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,"Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?"
7166,L30000,u266,m16,VOGLER,I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
7167,L29999,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,Leave me alone.
7168,L29998,u266,m16,VOGLER,Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
7169,L29997,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,What do you want?
7170,L29996,u266,m16,VOGLER,In the sight of God that is a sin.
7171,L29995,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,So?
7172,L29994,u266,m16,VOGLER,"You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?"
7173,L29993,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,About what?
7174,L29992,u266,m16,VOGLER,I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
7175,L29991,u257,m16,OLD SALIERI,What do you want?
7176,L30852,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Yes, in the third act."
7177,L30851,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?"
7178,L30850,u260,m16,SALIERI,Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
7179,L30849,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,Ballet? What ballet?
7180,L30848,u260,m16,SALIERI,About the ballet.
7181,L30847,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,What anger?
7182,L30844,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,The Emperor has given him permission.
7183,L30843,u260,m16,SALIERI,Incredible.
7184,L30842,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"Well, Mozart is already rehearsing."
7185,L30794,u260,m16,SALIERI,Never mind.
7186,L30793,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,Where?
7187,L30792,u260,m16,SALIERI,I've seen the manuscript.
7188,L30791,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,Are you absolutely sure?
7189,L30787,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,You must be mad.
7190,L30786,u260,m16,SALIERI,Yes.
7191,L30785,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,He's setting that play to music?
7192,L30784,u260,m16,SALIERI,Exactly.
7193,L30783,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,You mean that play?
7194,L30780,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,Italian?
7195,L30779,u260,m16,SALIERI,Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
7196,L30778,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,Yes?
7197,L30777,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director."
7198,L30799,u267,m16,VON STRACK,Ah.
7199,L30798,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor."
7200,L30797,u267,m16,VON STRACK,"Oh yes, yes. And that was?"
7201,L30796,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France."
7202,L30795,u267,m16,VON STRACK,"I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?"
7203,L30183,u267,m16,VON STRACK,Did we?
7204,L30182,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian."
7205,L30159,u267,m16,VON STRACK,"Well done, Sire!"
7206,L30158,u258,m16,ORSINI-ROSENBERG,"Bravo, Your Majesty!"
7207,L31180,u265,m16,UGLY OLD WOMAN,"Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you."
7208,L31179,u259,m16,PAPAGENO,"Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?"
7209,L31178,u265,m16,UGLY OLD WOMAN,"Of course now. Right away, before I get any older."
7210,L31177,u259,m16,PAPAGENO,What do you mean - now?
7211,L31176,u265,m16,UGLY OLD WOMAN,"Well, promise then."
7212,L31175,u259,m16,PAPAGENO,I can't wait.
7213,L31174,u265,m16,UGLY OLD WOMAN,Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
7214,L31173,u259,m16,PAPAGENO,"Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck."
7215,L31172,u265,m16,UGLY OLD WOMAN,"I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish."
7216,L31171,u259,m16,PAPAGENO,What? Who the devil are you?
7217,L31170,u265,m16,UGLY OLD WOMAN,"Here I am, my angel."
7218,L31050,u260,m16,SALIERI,Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
7219,L31049,u268,m16,VON SWIETEN,"How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent."
7220,L31048,u260,m16,SALIERI,"No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him."
7221,L31047,u268,m16,VON SWIETEN,Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
7222,L31046,u260,m16,SALIERI,"I agree, Baron."
7223,L31045,u268,m16,VON SWIETEN,"This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop."
7224,L30526,u260,m16,SALIERI,Come with me. And stay in the room.
7225,L30525,u264,m16,SERVANT,"He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting."
7226,L30524,u260,m16,SALIERI,What does he want?
7227,L30478,u260,m16,SALIERI,Show her in. Then go to bed.
7228,L30477,u264,m16,SERVANT,"That lady is back, sir."
7229,L30417,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Excuse me, my dear."
7230,L30416,u264,m16,SERVANT,She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
7231,L30415,u260,m16,SALIERI,Who is she?
7232,L30414,u264,m16,SERVANT,"Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you."
7233,L31226,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!"
7234,L31225,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?"
7235,L31223,u260,m16,SALIERI,Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
7236,L31222,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,I'll call tomorrow.
7237,L31221,u260,m16,SALIERI,Bene.
7238,L31220,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
7239,L31219,u260,m16,SALIERI,Of course.
7240,L31218,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,"Well, tell him we were here, won't you?"
7241,L31217,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest."
7242,L31216,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,But he's all right?
7243,L31215,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Well, he's sleeping now. Better not."
7244,L31214,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Can we come in?
7245,L31213,u260,m16,SALIERI,"Yes, I am looking after him."
7246,L31212,u261,m16,SCHIKANEDER,Herr Salieri.
7247,L31667,u269,m17,ALEX,Thank you.
7248,L31666,u280,m17,ORDERLY,"I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them."
7249,L31665,u269,m17,ALEX,"You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?"
7250,L31664,u280,m17,ORDERLY,"What do you mean, 'how did he look'?"
7251,L31663,u269,m17,ALEX,How did he look?
7252,L31662,u280,m17,ORDERLY,"The American? Yes, duck."
7253,L31661,u269,m17,ALEX,Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
7254,L32200,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,I doubt it. But it's something to do.
7255,L32199,u269,m17,ALEX,David?
7256,L32198,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
7257,L32135,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Tea would be nice.
7258,L32134,u269,m17,ALEX,What shall we do?
7259,L32060,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,I expect you shortly.
7260,L32059,u269,m17,ALEX,"No, a cab will be faster."
7261,L32058,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Shall I send a car?
7262,L32057,u269,m17,ALEX,He's fine. We'll come right over.
7263,L32056,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
7264,L32055,u269,m17,ALEX,"Yes, Doctor."
7265,L32054,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
7266,L32053,u269,m17,ALEX,"Yes, I should think so."
7267,L32052,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Could you get here without any trouble?
7268,L32051,u269,m17,ALEX,"No, not really."
7269,L32050,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Is David acting strangely?
7270,L32049,u269,m17,ALEX,"No, why?"
7271,L32048,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
7272,L32047,u269,m17,ALEX,"Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean."
7273,L32046,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,The zoo? Is he rational?
7274,L32045,u269,m17,ALEX,He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
7275,L32044,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
7276,L32043,u269,m17,ALEX,He's here.
7277,L31993,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
7278,L31992,u269,m17,ALEX,What shall we do?
7279,L31991,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others."
7280,L31990,u269,m17,ALEX,Dr. Hirsch?
7281,L31989,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?"
7282,L31988,u269,m17,ALEX,Surely you're not suggesting...
7283,L31987,u269,m17,ALEX,"No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone."
7284,L31986,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
7285,L31985,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf."
7286,L31984,u269,m17,ALEX,And what else?
7287,L31983,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there."
7288,L31982,u269,m17,ALEX,Yes.
7289,L31981,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
7290,L31980,u269,m17,ALEX,"Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?"
7291,L31979,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Warn him?
7292,L31978,u269,m17,ALEX,David says Jack comes to warn him.
7293,L31977,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,What did he say?
7294,L31976,u269,m17,ALEX,Yes.
7295,L31975,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Has his friend appeared to him again?
7296,L31974,u269,m17,ALEX,"Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend."
7297,L31973,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?"
7298,L31972,u269,m17,ALEX,He's not?
7299,L31969,u269,m17,ALEX,At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
7300,L31968,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,It's a full moon. Where is he?
7301,L31967,u269,m17,ALEX,"Yes, sir."
7302,L31966,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David."
7303,L31962,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Come to my office, Miss Price."
7304,L31961,u269,m17,ALEX,"It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have."
7305,L31591,u269,m17,ALEX,"Yes, I believe he did."
7306,L31590,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Did he say a wolf?
7307,L31557,u269,m17,ALEX,"No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor."
7308,L31556,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price."
7309,L31555,u269,m17,ALEX,What happened to them?
7310,L31554,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed."
7311,L31553,u269,m17,ALEX,He said 'Jack'.
7312,L31552,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,What exactly did he call out?
7313,L31551,u269,m17,ALEX,"Yes, Doctor?"
7314,L31550,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Oh, Miss Price?"
7315,L31549,u269,m17,ALEX,"Yes, Doctor."
7316,L31548,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Go about your duties.
7317,L31547,u269,m17,ALEX,Dr. Hirsch?
7318,L31546,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Can I be of service, Miss Price?"
7319,L31542,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital."
7320,L31541,u269,m17,ALEX,"Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago."
7321,L32119,u274,m17,DAVID,Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
7322,L32118,u269,m17,ALEX,"David, don't lose control."
7323,L32117,u274,m17,DAVID,"Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!"
7324,L32116,u269,m17,ALEX,"David, let's go now."
7325,L32115,u274,m17,DAVID,Hopeless. It's hopeless.
7326,L32106,u274,m17,DAVID,Will you shut up!?!!
7327,L32105,u269,m17,ALEX,"Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and..."
7328,L32093,u274,m17,DAVID,"I swear, I don't know this girl."
7329,L32092,u269,m17,ALEX,We had an argument. He's being silly.
7330,L32091,u274,m17,DAVID,What?
7331,L32090,u269,m17,ALEX,"He's playing a stupid joke, sir."
7332,L32087,u274,m17,DAVID,"Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!"
7333,L32086,u269,m17,ALEX,"David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch."
7334,L32085,u274,m17,DAVID,"Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police."
7335,L32084,u269,m17,ALEX,Jack is dead!
7336,L32083,u274,m17,DAVID,I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
7337,L32082,u269,m17,ALEX,"David, stop!"
7338,L32081,u274,m17,DAVID,"Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex."
7339,L32080,u269,m17,ALEX,"David, what are you doing?"
7340,L32077,u274,m17,DAVID,Pull over.
7341,L32076,u269,m17,ALEX,But...
7342,L32065,u274,m17,DAVID,I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
7343,L32064,u269,m17,ALEX,Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
7344,L32063,u274,m17,DAVID,I should be committed.
7345,L32062,u269,m17,ALEX,The next corner we can get a cab.
7346,L32037,u274,m17,DAVID,I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
7347,L32036,u269,m17,ALEX,Don't you remember?
7348,L32035,u274,m17,DAVID,"Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?"
7349,L32034,u269,m17,ALEX,The zoo?
7350,L32033,u274,m17,DAVID,"Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!"
7351,L32032,u274,m17,DAVID,I'm freezing.
7352,L32031,u269,m17,ALEX,David! Where on earth have you been!?!
7353,L31919,u274,m17,DAVID,See you later.
7354,L31918,u269,m17,ALEX,I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
7355,L31917,u274,m17,DAVID,A doper werewolf.
7356,L31916,u269,m17,ALEX,I've left those pills for you.
7357,L31915,u274,m17,DAVID,Okay.
7358,L31914,u269,m17,ALEX,"Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?"
7359,L31913,u274,m17,DAVID,"Yeah, I do, but go to work."
7360,L31912,u269,m17,ALEX,"David, do you want me to stay here tonight?"
7361,L31911,u274,m17,DAVID,Werewolves simply do not exist.
7362,L31910,u269,m17,ALEX,It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
7363,L31909,u274,m17,DAVID,Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
7364,L31908,u269,m17,ALEX,Anything.
7365,L31907,u274,m17,DAVID,Do me an enormous favor?
7366,L31906,u269,m17,ALEX,"Let me go now, you'll make me late."
7367,L31852,u274,m17,DAVID,"That's good, Alex.  Reassure me."
7368,L31851,u269,m17,ALEX,Tomorrow is the full moon.
7369,L31850,u274,m17,DAVID,I wasn't hallucinating.
7370,L31849,u269,m17,ALEX,"But, David."
7371,L31848,u274,m17,DAVID,I was awake and he was in my room.
7372,L31847,u269,m17,ALEX,"David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?"
7373,L31846,u274,m17,DAVID,Good.
7374,L31845,u269,m17,ALEX,Of course.
7375,L31844,u274,m17,DAVID,Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
7376,L31843,u269,m17,ALEX,Yes?
7377,L31842,u274,m17,DAVID,Alex?
7378,L31841,u269,m17,ALEX,It's nice to see you.
7379,L31840,u274,m17,DAVID,It's nice to see you.
7380,L31839,u269,m17,ALEX,"David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower."
7381,L31838,u274,m17,DAVID,There is only one bed.
7382,L31837,u269,m17,ALEX,The bedroom.
7383,L31836,u274,m17,DAVID,Lovely.
7384,L31835,u269,m17,ALEX,Bathroom.
7385,L31834,u274,m17,DAVID,Charming.
7386,L31833,u269,m17,ALEX,Closet.
7387,L31832,u274,m17,DAVID,Very nice.
7388,L31831,u269,m17,ALEX,The kitchen.
7389,L31829,u274,m17,DAVID,"Yeah, I would think so, too."
7390,L31828,u269,m17,ALEX,I would think so.
7391,L31827,u274,m17,DAVID,I was dreaming again?
7392,L31826,u269,m17,ALEX,What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
7393,L31825,u274,m17,DAVID,Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
7394,L31824,u269,m17,ALEX,Your dead friend Jack?
7395,L31823,u274,m17,DAVID,My friend Jack was just here.
7396,L31822,u269,m17,ALEX,You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
7397,L31821,u274,m17,DAVID,I'll let you know the next full moon.
7398,L31820,u269,m17,ALEX,Are you better now?
7399,L31819,u269,m17,ALEX,A werewolf?
7400,L31818,u274,m17,DAVID,I'm a werewolf.
7401,L31758,u269,m17,ALEX,Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
7402,L31757,u274,m17,DAVID,Now I'm embarrassed.
7403,L31756,u269,m17,ALEX,All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
7404,L31755,u274,m17,DAVID,"Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it."
7405,L31754,u269,m17,ALEX,"You're being awfully forward, aren't you?"
7406,L31753,u274,m17,DAVID,Not just a patient -- me.
7407,L31752,u269,m17,ALEX,How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
7408,L31751,u274,m17,DAVID,Will you think about it?
7409,L31750,u269,m17,ALEX,"Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now."
7410,L31749,u274,m17,DAVID,I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
7411,L31748,u269,m17,ALEX,What?
7412,L31747,u274,m17,DAVID,Will you come with me?
7413,L31746,u269,m17,ALEX,"David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away."
7414,L31745,u274,m17,DAVID,I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
7415,L31744,u269,m17,ALEX,That's easy enough.
7416,L31743,u274,m17,DAVID,"No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while."
7417,L31742,u269,m17,ALEX,Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
7418,L31741,u274,m17,DAVID,I'm sorry I woke you up.
7419,L31740,u269,m17,ALEX,Hello. You all right?
7420,L31736,u269,m17,ALEX,"Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd..."
7421,L31735,u274,m17,DAVID,"Yes, go on."
7422,L31734,u269,m17,ALEX,A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
7423,L31733,u274,m17,DAVID,"What? Oh, yes, please."
7424,L31732,u269,m17,ALEX,Shall I read to you?
7425,L31731,u274,m17,DAVID,My best friend. My very best friend.
7426,L31730,u269,m17,ALEX,Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
7427,L31729,u274,m17,DAVID,Now what do you want to talk about?
7428,L31728,u269,m17,ALEX,I know.
7429,L31727,u274,m17,DAVID,I'm twenty-seven.
7430,L31726,u269,m17,ALEX,Twenty-eight.
7431,L31725,u274,m17,DAVID,How old are you?
7432,L31724,u269,m17,ALEX,That's not really a very proper question.
7433,L31723,u274,m17,DAVID,How old are you?
7434,L31722,u274,m17,DAVID,It's okay. I want to talk to you.
7435,L31721,u269,m17,ALEX,I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
7436,L31720,u274,m17,DAVID,I dream of death mostly.
7437,L31719,u269,m17,ALEX,What do you dream about?
7438,L31718,u269,m17,ALEX,I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
7439,L31717,u274,m17,DAVID,Do you like it?
7440,L31716,u269,m17,ALEX,'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
7441,L31715,u274,m17,DAVID,I was. What are you reading?
7442,L31714,u269,m17,ALEX,I thought you were asleep.
7443,L31713,u274,m17,DAVID,You're a very beautiful girl.
7444,L31688,u274,m17,DAVID,Will you give me a break?
7445,L31687,u269,m17,ALEX,"Let's try a little harder, shall we?"
7446,L31686,u269,m17,ALEX,Right.
7447,L31685,u274,m17,DAVID,This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
7448,L31684,u269,m17,ALEX,"Shall I be forced to feed you, David?"
7449,L31683,u274,m17,DAVID,Call me David.
7450,L31682,u269,m17,ALEX,"Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?"
7451,L31681,u274,m17,DAVID,"Aw come on, Alex!"
7452,L31680,u269,m17,ALEX,Call me Alex.
7453,L31679,u274,m17,DAVID,"Aw come on, Miss Price!"
7454,L31678,u269,m17,ALEX,Sorry.
7455,L31677,u274,m17,DAVID,Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
7456,L31676,u269,m17,ALEX,"Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?"
7457,L31675,u274,m17,DAVID,How is that?
7458,L31674,u269,m17,ALEX,"You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler."
7459,L31673,u274,m17,DAVID,"Please, really. I'm not hungry."
7460,L31672,u269,m17,ALEX,I'm afraid you have to eat something.
7461,L31671,u274,m17,DAVID,"I'm not very hungry, thank you."
7462,L31670,u269,m17,ALEX,You haven't eaten your lunch.
7463,L31669,u274,m17,DAVID,Yes?
7464,L31668,u269,m17,ALEX,Mr. Kessler?
7465,L31589,u274,m17,DAVID,A wolf.
7466,L31588,u269,m17,ALEX,What?
7467,L31587,u274,m17,DAVID,It was a wolf.
7468,L31586,u269,m17,ALEX,I beg your pardon?
7469,L31585,u274,m17,DAVID,It wasn't a lunatic.
7470,L31935,u269,m17,ALEX,I thought not.
7471,L31934,u270,m17,BENJAMIN,No.
7472,L31933,u269,m17,ALEX,"Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?"
7473,L31932,u270,m17,BENJAMIN,No!
7474,L31931,u269,m17,ALEX,No what?
7475,L31930,u270,m17,BENJAMIN,No.
7476,L31929,u269,m17,ALEX,How are we feeling tonight?
7477,L31660,u269,m17,ALEX,Right.
7478,L31659,u270,m17,BENJAMIN,No.
7479,L31658,u269,m17,ALEX,The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
7480,L31657,u270,m17,BENJAMIN,No.
7481,L31656,u269,m17,ALEX,Feeling better?
7482,L31655,u270,m17,BENJAMIN,No.
7483,L31654,u269,m17,ALEX,"Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this."
7484,L31653,u270,m17,BENJAMIN,No.
7485,L31652,u269,m17,ALEX,No what?
7486,L31651,u270,m17,BENJAMIN,No.
7487,L31650,u269,m17,ALEX,"Hello, Benjamin."
7488,L31539,u269,m17,ALEX,"Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now."
7489,L31538,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,I looked.
7490,L31537,u269,m17,ALEX,Why on earth do you say that?
7491,L31536,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,I think he's a Jew.
7492,L31535,u269,m17,ALEX,Chart says he's from New York.
7493,L31534,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,"He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him."
7494,L31533,u269,m17,ALEX,"Yes, I should think. He called out just now."
7495,L31532,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,He all right?
7496,L31649,u269,m17,ALEX,"Yes, Mrs. Hobbs."
7497,L31648,u279,m17,MRS. HOBBS,"Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold."
7498,L31647,u269,m17,ALEX,Has he been refusing food?
7499,L31646,u279,m17,MRS. HOBBS,"Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?"
7500,L31645,u269,m17,ALEX,"Yes, Mrs. Hobbs."
7501,L31644,u279,m17,MRS. HOBBS,Miss Price.
7502,L32104,u274,m17,DAVID,"That's what I want you to do, you moron!"
7503,L32103,u271,m17,BOBBIE,You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
7504,L32102,u274,m17,DAVID,Who is this girl?
7505,L32099,u274,m17,DAVID,Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
7506,L32098,u271,m17,BOBBIE,Now see here young man.
7507,L32097,u274,m17,DAVID,Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
7508,L32096,u271,m17,BOBBIE,There's no call for that kind of language.
7509,L32095,u274,m17,DAVID,"Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!"
7510,L32094,u271,m17,BOBBIE,"All right, you two, move along."
7511,L32089,u271,m17,BOBBIE,"You did, did you?"
7512,L32088,u274,m17,DAVID,"Officer, I killed those people last night."
7513,L32171,u274,m17,DAVID,Why are you doing this to me?
7514,L32170,u272,m17,BRINGSLY,"No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead."
7515,L32169,u274,m17,DAVID,That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
7516,L32161,u272,m17,BRINGSLY,You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
7517,L32160,u274,m17,DAVID,"Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you."
7518,L32159,u272,m17,BRINGSLY,"This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities."
7519,L32158,u274,m17,DAVID,"Why are you doing this to me, Jack?"
7520,L31475,u283,m17,WOMAN,You could have told them!
7521,L31474,u273,m17,CHESS PLAYER,No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
7522,L31429,u283,m17,WOMAN,"That's very funny, that is."
7523,L31428,u273,m17,CHESS PLAYER,"Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations."
7524,L31421,u273,m17,CHESS PLAYER,No. You've had your chance.
7525,L31420,u283,m17,WOMAN,"Oh, come on, tell us."
7526,L31419,u273,m17,CHESS PLAYER,"All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it."
7527,L31418,u283,m17,WOMAN,"Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!"
7528,L31417,u273,m17,CHESS PLAYER,"You be quiet, woman, and let me speak."
7529,L31416,u283,m17,WOMAN,"No, but we're about to."
7530,L31415,u273,m17,CHESS PLAYER,"Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?"
7531,L31642,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,Bambi?
7532,L31641,u274,m17,DAVID,"Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?"
7533,L31640,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,"Some, everyone does."
7534,L31639,u274,m17,DAVID,"Do you have bad dreams, too?"
7535,L31638,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,"An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep."
7536,L31637,u274,m17,DAVID,What are you going to see?
7537,L31636,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,"Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you."
7538,L31635,u274,m17,DAVID,Alex?
7539,L31634,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,"It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex."
7540,L31633,u274,m17,DAVID,What time is it?
7541,L31632,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
7542,L31630,u274,m17,DAVID,I was having a nightmare.
7543,L31629,u278,m17,MISS GALLAGHER,"Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please."
7544,L31712,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price."
7545,L31711,u274,m17,DAVID,Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
7546,L31709,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake."
7547,L31708,u274,m17,DAVID,"You really think I'm crazy, don't you?"
7548,L31707,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly."
7549,L31706,u274,m17,DAVID,Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
7550,L31705,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,I really don't know.
7551,L31704,u274,m17,DAVID,Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
7552,L31703,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here."
7553,L31702,u274,m17,DAVID,Did you see Jack?
7554,L31701,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
7555,L31700,u274,m17,DAVID,"Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands."
7556,L31699,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Yes.
7557,L31698,u274,m17,DAVID,"I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog."
7558,L31697,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
7559,L31696,u274,m17,DAVID,"Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre."
7560,L31695,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,You've never had bad dreams before?
7561,L31628,u274,m17,DAVID,"Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about."
7562,L31627,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
7563,L31626,u274,m17,DAVID,How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
7564,L31625,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,So they said.
7565,L31624,u274,m17,DAVID,There were witnesses?
7566,L31584,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now."
7567,L31583,u274,m17,DAVID,Lunatic?
7568,L31582,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten."
7569,L31581,u274,m17,DAVID,Two weeks?
7570,L31580,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
7571,L31579,u274,m17,DAVID,How long have I been here?
7572,L31573,u274,m17,DAVID,Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
7573,L31572,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Miss Price! Miss Price, please!"
7574,L31564,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead."
7575,L31563,u274,m17,DAVID,The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
7576,L31562,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
7577,L31561,u274,m17,DAVID,London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
7578,L31560,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,You're in a hospital in London.
7579,L31559,u274,m17,DAVID,Where am I?
7580,L31558,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins."
7581,L32177,u276,m17,JACK,"If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death."
7582,L32176,u274,m17,DAVID,I could hang myself.
7583,L32173,u274,m17,DAVID,How shall I do it?
7584,L32172,u276,m17,JACK,Because this must be stopped.
7585,L32156,u276,m17,JACK,Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
7586,L32155,u274,m17,DAVID,Hello.
7587,L32154,u276,m17,JACK,"David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly."
7588,L32153,u276,m17,JACK,I want you to meet some people.
7589,L32152,u274,m17,DAVID,"Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack."
7590,L32151,u276,m17,JACK,What about the zoo?
7591,L32150,u274,m17,DAVID,I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
7592,L32149,u276,m17,JACK,Thank you.
7593,L32148,u274,m17,DAVID,You look awful.
7594,L32147,u276,m17,JACK,"If I was still alive, I probably would."
7595,L32146,u274,m17,DAVID,"Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?"
7596,L32145,u276,m17,JACK,You don't have to say anything.
7597,L32144,u274,m17,DAVID,"What can I say, Jack?"
7598,L32143,u276,m17,JACK,"Hi, David."
7599,L32142,u274,m17,DAVID,"Hi, Jack."
7600,L31874,u274,m17,DAVID,I will not accept this! Now go away!
7601,L31873,u276,m17,JACK,"The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!"
7602,L31872,u274,m17,DAVID,"What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!"
7603,L31871,u276,m17,JACK,You must believe me.
7604,L31870,u274,m17,DAVID,I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
7605,L31869,u276,m17,JACK,What do you think?
7606,L31868,u274,m17,DAVID,"Jack, are you really dead?"
7607,L31867,u276,m17,JACK,"You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late."
7608,L31866,u274,m17,DAVID,"A monster. I know, I know."
7609,L31865,u276,m17,JACK,"David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become..."
7610,L31864,u274,m17,DAVID,"Get out of here, Jack!"
7611,L31863,u276,m17,JACK,Yes.
7612,L31862,u274,m17,DAVID,I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
7613,L31861,u276,m17,JACK,"David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on."
7614,L31860,u274,m17,DAVID,"Okay, you've seen me. Now go away."
7615,L31859,u276,m17,JACK,I wanted to see you.
7616,L31858,u274,m17,DAVID,What are you doing here?
7617,L31857,u276,m17,JACK,"Don't be an asshole, David. Come here."
7618,L31856,u274,m17,DAVID,You're not real.
7619,L31812,u276,m17,JACK,"It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others."
7620,L31811,u274,m17,DAVID,Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
7621,L31810,u276,m17,JACK,"The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me."
7622,L31809,u274,m17,DAVID,Nurse!
7623,L31808,u276,m17,JACK,"Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance."
7624,L31807,u274,m17,DAVID,Nurse!
7625,L31806,u276,m17,JACK,"David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins."
7626,L31805,u274,m17,DAVID,You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
7627,L31804,u276,m17,JACK,You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
7628,L31803,u274,m17,DAVID,"Jack, please go away. Please go away."
7629,L31802,u276,m17,JACK,"Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days."
7630,L31801,u274,m17,DAVID,"Stop it, Jack."
7631,L31800,u276,m17,JACK,Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
7632,L31799,u274,m17,DAVID,What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
7633,L31798,u276,m17,JACK,You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
7634,L31797,u274,m17,DAVID,What?!
7635,L31796,u276,m17,JACK,"It's you, David."
7636,L31795,u274,m17,DAVID,Will you be quiet?!
7637,L31794,u276,m17,JACK,The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
7638,L31793,u274,m17,DAVID,What's wrong with you? Shut up!
7639,L31792,u276,m17,JACK,"I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted."
7640,L31791,u274,m17,DAVID,"Shut up, you zombie!"
7641,L31790,u276,m17,JACK,"On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf."
7642,L31789,u274,m17,DAVID,I'm not listening!
7643,L31788,u276,m17,JACK,We were attacked by a werewolf.
7644,L31787,u274,m17,DAVID,"If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!"
7645,L31786,u276,m17,JACK,"I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know."
7646,L31785,u274,m17,DAVID,"Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?"
7647,L31784,u276,m17,JACK,"David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you."
7648,L31783,u274,m17,DAVID,What?!
7649,L31782,u276,m17,JACK,David!
7650,L31781,u274,m17,DAVID,I'm going completely crazy.
7651,L31780,u276,m17,JACK,Life mocks me even in death.
7652,L31779,u274,m17,DAVID,Rudy Levine the shmuck?
7653,L31778,u276,m17,JACK,So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
7654,L31777,u274,m17,DAVID,I can't stand it.
7655,L31776,u276,m17,JACK,Debbie Klein cried a lot.
7656,L31775,u274,m17,DAVID,Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
7657,L31774,u276,m17,JACK,Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
7658,L31773,u274,m17,DAVID,Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
7659,L31772,u276,m17,JACK,"I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come."
7660,L31771,u274,m17,DAVID,"Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!"
7661,L31770,u276,m17,JACK,David! You're hurting my feelings.
7662,L31769,u276,m17,JACK,"I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me."
7663,L31768,u274,m17,DAVID,This is too much. I can't handle this.
7664,L31767,u276,m17,JACK,Thanks a lot.
7665,L31766,u274,m17,DAVID,"Get the fuck out of here, Jack."
7666,L31765,u276,m17,JACK,Nice to see you.
7667,L31525,u274,m17,DAVID,Are you going to help me up?
7668,L31524,u276,m17,JACK,"You really scared me, you shithead."
7669,L31523,u274,m17,DAVID,Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
7670,L31522,u276,m17,JACK,I'll tell you when we get there.
7671,L31521,u274,m17,DAVID,Where are we going?
7672,L31520,u276,m17,JACK,Yeah.
7673,L31519,u274,m17,DAVID,Jack?
7674,L31518,u276,m17,JACK,Not far enough. Come on.
7675,L31517,u274,m17,DAVID,It sounds far away.
7676,L31516,u276,m17,JACK,No.
7677,L31515,u274,m17,DAVID,See anything?
7678,L31514,u276,m17,JACK,"Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away."
7679,L31513,u274,m17,DAVID,"Walk away, Jack."
7680,L31512,u276,m17,JACK,Nice doggie. Good boy.
7681,L31511,u274,m17,DAVID,A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
7682,L31510,u276,m17,JACK,Oh shit. What is that?
7683,L31509,u276,m17,JACK,Do you think it's a dog?
7684,L31508,u274,m17,DAVID,It's in front of us.
7685,L31506,u274,m17,DAVID,Let's just keep walking.
7686,L31505,u276,m17,JACK,Plan?
7687,L31504,u274,m17,DAVID,What's the plan?
7688,L31502,u276,m17,JACK,It's circling us.
7689,L31501,u274,m17,DAVID,It's moving.
7690,L31500,u274,m17,DAVID,Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
7691,L31499,u276,m17,JACK,"Come on, where?"
7692,L31498,u274,m17,DAVID,I don't know. Come on.
7693,L31497,u276,m17,JACK,"Shit! David, what is that?"
7694,L31495,u274,m17,DAVID,Yeah.
7695,L31494,u276,m17,JACK,I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
7696,L31493,u276,m17,JACK,"It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'."
7697,L31492,u274,m17,DAVID,"No, but he was on the moors."
7698,L31491,u276,m17,JACK,Heathcliffe didn't howl.
7699,L31490,u274,m17,DAVID,Heathcliffe.
7700,L31489,u276,m17,JACK,Pecos Bill.
7701,L31488,u274,m17,DAVID,The Hound of the Baskervilles.
7702,L31487,u276,m17,JACK,There aren't any coyotes in England.
7703,L31486,u274,m17,DAVID,A coyote.
7704,L31485,u276,m17,JACK,Yeah?
7705,L31484,u274,m17,DAVID,Could be a lot of things.
7706,L31483,u276,m17,JACK,What was it?
7707,L31482,u274,m17,DAVID,I heard that.
7708,L31481,u276,m17,JACK,Did you hear that?
7709,L31471,u274,m17,DAVID,I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
7710,L31470,u276,m17,JACK,"Say, David..."
7711,L31467,u274,m17,DAVID,"I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly."
7712,L31466,u276,m17,JACK,Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
7713,L31465,u274,m17,DAVID,I have no idea.
7714,L31464,u276,m17,JACK,What do you think was wrong?
7715,L31463,u274,m17,DAVID,"Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob."
7716,L31462,u276,m17,JACK,"I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob."
7717,L31461,u274,m17,DAVID,That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
7718,L31456,u274,m17,DAVID,"Come on, I'm freezing."
7719,L31455,u276,m17,JACK,Beware the moon?
7720,L31454,u274,m17,DAVID,I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
7721,L31453,u276,m17,JACK,What the hell was that all about?
7722,L31444,u276,m17,JACK,Apparently so.
7723,L31443,u274,m17,DAVID,"Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!"
7724,L31441,u276,m17,JACK,What do you mean? I'm starving.
7725,L31440,u274,m17,DAVID,"Jack, we'd better go."
7726,L31431,u274,m17,DAVID,You ask them.
7727,L31430,u276,m17,JACK,"Go on, ask them."
7728,L31427,u274,m17,DAVID,Wrong.
7729,L31426,u276,m17,JACK,Right.
7730,L31425,u274,m17,DAVID,I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
7731,L31424,u276,m17,JACK,"Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man."
7732,L31423,u274,m17,DAVID,You ask them.
7733,L31422,u276,m17,JACK,Ask them what the candles are for.
7734,L31406,u274,m17,DAVID,Maybe the owners are from Texas.
7735,L31405,u276,m17,JACK,It's a five-pointed star.
7736,L31404,u274,m17,DAVID,What about it?
7737,L31403,u276,m17,JACK,Look at that.
7738,L31402,u274,m17,DAVID,"Listen, at least it's warm in here."
7739,L31401,u276,m17,JACK,Nice looking group.
7740,L31388,u276,m17,JACK,Nice to see you.
7741,L31387,u274,m17,DAVID,Hello.
7742,L31386,u274,m17,DAVID,Shall we?
7743,L31385,u276,m17,JACK,Okay.
7744,L31384,u274,m17,DAVID,I assume full responsibility.
7745,L31383,u276,m17,JACK,"David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault."
7746,L31382,u274,m17,DAVID,A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
7747,L31381,u276,m17,JACK,That's not a spear. It's a pike.
7748,L31380,u274,m17,DAVID,"Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?"
7749,L31379,u276,m17,JACK,That's a wolf's head.
7750,L31378,u274,m17,DAVID,"Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?"
7751,L31377,u276,m17,JACK,The Slaughtered Lamb?
7752,L31376,u276,m17,JACK,She says she 'likes me too much'.
7753,L31375,u274,m17,DAVID,"We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?"
7754,L31374,u276,m17,JACK,It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
7755,L31373,u274,m17,DAVID,It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
7756,L31372,u276,m17,JACK,I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
7757,L31371,u274,m17,DAVID,"If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you."
7758,L31370,u276,m17,JACK,Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
7759,L31369,u274,m17,DAVID,I don't know.
7760,L31368,u276,m17,JACK,"Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?"
7761,L31367,u274,m17,DAVID,"I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break."
7762,L31366,u276,m17,JACK,You're talking about the woman I love.
7763,L31365,u274,m17,DAVID,She's a jerk.
7764,L31364,u276,m17,JACK,Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
7765,L31363,u274,m17,DAVID,I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
7766,L31362,u276,m17,JACK,Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
7767,L31361,u274,m17,DAVID,Right.
7768,L31360,u276,m17,JACK,"I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later."
7769,L31359,u274,m17,DAVID,"Well, I like it here."
7770,L31358,u276,m17,JACK,"Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?"
7771,L31357,u274,m17,DAVID,You're not having a good time are you?
7772,L31356,u276,m17,JACK,David.
7773,L31355,u274,m17,DAVID,Jack.
7774,L31354,u276,m17,JACK,Good.
7775,L31353,u274,m17,DAVID,Yes.
7776,L31352,u276,m17,JACK,Are you cold?
7777,L32131,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,"Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you."
7778,L32130,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,What can we do to assist you?
7779,L32123,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him."
7780,L32122,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,"The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think..."
7781,L31614,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Why don't we ask him?
7782,L31613,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
7783,L31612,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,You were saying?
7784,L31603,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?"
7785,L31602,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,"No, thank you, Doctor."
7786,L31597,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?"
7787,L31596,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,Dr. Hirsch?
7788,L31611,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,"Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!"
7789,L31610,u281,m17,SECRETARY,He's on the telephone.
7790,L31609,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,What here?
7791,L31608,u281,m17,SECRETARY,"Roger Mathison, Doctor."
7792,L31607,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Excuse me.  Yes?
7793,L31595,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Send them in.
7794,L31594,u281,m17,SECRETARY,"Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor."
7795,L31593,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Yes?
7796,L31896,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
7797,L31895,u283,m17,WOMAN,"Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it."
7798,L31894,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,What's that?
7799,L31884,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,I suppose Guinness will suffice.
7800,L31883,u283,m17,WOMAN,"Sorry, love."
7801,L31882,u275,m17,DR. HIRSCH,Campari and soda would do nicely.
7802,L31881,u283,m17,WOMAN,"Hello, there. What can I get you?"
7803,L31408,u283,m17,WOMAN,I beg your pardon?
7804,L31407,u276,m17,JACK,Remember the Alamo?
7805,L31399,u283,m17,WOMAN,But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
7806,L31398,u276,m17,JACK,Oh.
7807,L31397,u283,m17,WOMAN,No.
7808,L31396,u276,m17,JACK,Then you have some hot tea?
7809,L31395,u283,m17,WOMAN,"We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea."
7810,L31394,u276,m17,JACK,Hot chocolate?
7811,L31391,u283,m17,WOMAN,No.
7812,L31390,u276,m17,JACK,Do you have any hot soup?
7813,L32133,u282,m17,SGT. MCMANUS,"We'll find him, not to worry."
7814,L32132,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,"I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that."
7815,L31622,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,"That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day."
7816,L31621,u282,m17,SGT. MCMANUS,"I don't rightly know, sir."
7817,L31620,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,"And what, Sergeant?"
7818,L31619,u282,m17,SGT. MCMANUS,"Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and..."
7819,L31618,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,"Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock."
7820,L31617,u282,m17,SGT. MCMANUS,"He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man."
7821,L31606,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
7822,L31605,u282,m17,SGT. MCMANUS,Sorry.
7823,L31599,u282,m17,SGT. MCMANUS,"I'd like some tea, please."
7824,L31598,u277,m17,LT. VILLIERS,"No, thank you."
7825,L34791,u288,m18,DICKSON,Yeah - sure!
7826,L34790,u284,m18,BILL,Yes - sure
7827,L34789,u288,m18,DICKSON,"If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?"
7828,L34788,u284,m18,BILL,Why not?
7829,L34787,u288,m18,DICKSON,She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
7830,L34786,u284,m18,BILL,What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
7831,L34760,u284,m18,BILL,"But listen, Tom, I"
7832,L34759,u288,m18,DICKSON,"I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent."
7833,L34758,u284,m18,BILL,"Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest"
7834,L34750,u284,m18,BILL,I want to know why .
7835,L34749,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?"
7836,L34748,u284,m18,BILL,"What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!"
7837,L34747,u288,m18,DICKSON,You here again? What do you want?
7838,L34746,u284,m18,BILL,"Hello, Tom."
7839,L35130,u303,m18,OSCAR,Yeah.
7840,L35129,u285,m18,CHARLIE,He has?
7841,L35128,u303,m18,OSCAR,The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
7842,L35127,u285,m18,CHARLIE,Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
7843,L35126,u303,m18,OSCAR,Matt?
7844,L35125,u285,m18,CHARLIE,Where's Matt?
7845,L35124,u303,m18,OSCAR,"No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin."
7846,L35123,u285,m18,CHARLIE,No kidding?
7847,L35122,u303,m18,OSCAR,"I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet."
7848,L35121,u285,m18,CHARLIE,"Oscar, what's the matter?"
7849,L35050,u285,m18,CHARLIE,"Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own."
7850,L35049,u297,m18,MATT,"And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning."
7851,L35048,u285,m18,CHARLIE,Yeah.
7852,L35047,u297,m18,MATT,I remember once when your account checked.
7853,L35046,u285,m18,CHARLIE,"I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too."
7854,L35045,u297,m18,MATT,"What's the matter, Charlie?"
7855,L35044,u285,m18,CHARLIE,Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
7856,L35043,u297,m18,MATT,Where you been?
7857,L34640,u297,m18,MATT,"Aw, nerts!"
7858,L34639,u285,m18,CHARLIE,"Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?"
7859,L34638,u297,m18,MATT,It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
7860,L34637,u285,m18,CHARLIE,Whose death?
7861,L34635,u285,m18,CHARLIE,"Baby, I can't give you anything but love..."
7862,L34634,u297,m18,MATT,"I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I"
7863,L34633,u285,m18,CHARLIE,Yeah?
7864,L34632,u297,m18,MATT,Charlie!
7865,L34631,u285,m18,CHARLIE,"Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit."
7866,L34630,u297,m18,MATT,Let me have ten bucks?
7867,L34629,u285,m18,CHARLIE,Yeah.
7868,L34628,u297,m18,MATT,"Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?"
7869,L34627,u297,m18,MATT,Here's twenty-five thousand.
7870,L34626,u285,m18,CHARLIE,Yeah.
7871,L34625,u297,m18,MATT,It was more than that last week.
7872,L34624,u285,m18,CHARLIE,About twenty-four thousand.
7873,L34623,u297,m18,MATT,How much?
7874,L34622,u285,m18,CHARLIE,"Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls."
7875,L34664,u292,m18,HELEN,"Yes, sir."
7876,L34663,u286,m18,CLARK,And tell him not to delay.
7877,L34662,u292,m18,HELEN,"Yes, sir."
7878,L34661,u286,m18,CLARK,"When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room."
7879,L34660,u292,m18,HELEN,"Not yet, Mr. Clark."
7880,L34659,u286,m18,CLARK,Mr. Dickson in yet?
7881,L35356,u286,m18,CLARK,"All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it."
7882,L35355,u302,m18,O'BRIEN,You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
7883,L34825,u302,m18,O'BRIEN,"Take it easy, Clark."
7884,L34824,u286,m18,CLARK,How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
7885,L34679,u286,m18,CLARK,"What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!"
7886,L34678,u302,m18,O'BRIEN,What good will that do?
7887,L34677,u286,m18,CLARK,Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
7888,L34676,u302,m18,O'BRIEN,"Don't make me laugh, Schultz!"
7889,L34674,u286,m18,CLARK,"Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it."
7890,L34673,u302,m18,O'BRIEN,"Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right."
7891,L35540,u288,m18,DICKSON,"You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world."
7892,L35539,u286,m18,CLARK,We've been waiting fifteen minutes
7893,L35538,u288,m18,DICKSON,Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
7894,L35483,u288,m18,DICKSON,The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
7895,L35482,u286,m18,CLARK,"Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank."
7896,L35344,u288,m18,DICKSON,"I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill."
7897,L35343,u286,m18,CLARK,"Say, you can't do that"
7898,L35340,u288,m18,DICKSON,"So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever."
7899,L35339,u286,m18,CLARK,"No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president."
7900,L35338,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob."
7901,L35337,u286,m18,CLARK,The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
7902,L35334,u288,m18,DICKSON,"I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?"
7903,L35333,u286,m18,CLARK,"That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?"
7904,L35332,u288,m18,DICKSON,"I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes."
7905,L35331,u286,m18,CLARK,"What do you mean, help?"
7906,L35330,u288,m18,DICKSON,We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
7907,L35257,u286,m18,CLARK,We'll discuss that in the board room.
7908,L35256,u288,m18,DICKSON,What about?
7909,L35255,u286,m18,CLARK,We want to talk to you.
7910,L34922,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me."
7911,L34921,u286,m18,CLARK,"Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!"
7912,L34920,u288,m18,DICKSON,I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
7913,L34913,u286,m18,CLARK,"I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!"
7914,L34912,u288,m18,DICKSON,Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
7915,L34845,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums."
7916,L34844,u286,m18,CLARK,"Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?"
7917,L34830,u286,m18,CLARK,Just pure luck!
7918,L34829,u288,m18,DICKSON,What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
7919,L34799,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?"
7920,L34798,u286,m18,CLARK,"I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind."
7921,L34797,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything"
7922,L35455,u287,m18,CLUETT,"He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she"
7923,L35454,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
7924,L35453,u287,m18,CLUETT,"I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!"
7925,L35452,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
7926,L35451,u287,m18,CLUETT,"I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!"
7927,L35449,u287,m18,CLUETT,They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
7928,L35448,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
7929,L35431,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!"
7930,L35430,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you."
7931,L35429,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"All right, Jack, all right."
7932,L35428,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun."
7933,L35412,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings ""Mother Machree"" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time."
7934,L35411,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming ""Mother Machree."""
7935,L35410,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Thanks.
7936,L35407,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"Why, of course."
7937,L35406,u287,m18,CLUETT,You understand?
7938,L35405,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Oh!
7939,L35404,u287,m18,CLUETT,"If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married."
7940,L35403,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?"
7941,L35402,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady."
7942,L35401,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary."
7943,L35400,u287,m18,CLUETT,That's very simple. I was home.
7944,L35399,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
7945,L35398,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?"
7946,L35397,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett."
7947,L35473,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Get out, get out!"
7948,L35472,u287,m18,CLUETT,"She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't"
7949,L35461,u287,m18,CLUETT,She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
7950,L35460,u288,m18,DICKSON,You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
7951,L35459,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying."
7952,L35458,u288,m18,DICKSON,What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
7953,L35444,u287,m18,CLUETT,"But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!"
7954,L35443,u288,m18,DICKSON,Fifty thousand dollars!
7955,L35442,u287,m18,CLUETT,Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
7956,L35441,u288,m18,DICKSON,What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
7957,L35440,u287,m18,CLUETT,"I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson."
7958,L35439,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?"
7959,L34883,u289,m18,DUDE,"Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!"
7960,L34882,u287,m18,CLUETT,"But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?"
7961,L34881,u289,m18,DUDE,Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
7962,L34880,u287,m18,CLUETT,"know, but"
7963,L34879,u289,m18,DUDE,"You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight."
7964,L34878,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?"
7965,L34864,u289,m18,DUDE,"All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?"
7966,L34863,u287,m18,CLUETT,What do you mean?
7967,L34862,u289,m18,DUDE,You don't have to do nothing.
7968,L34861,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Why, I couldn't do that . . . !"
7969,L34860,u289,m18,DUDE,Why not?
7970,L34859,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I"
7971,L34854,u289,m18,DUDE,We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
7972,L34853,u287,m18,CLUETT,"But after all, you can't take blood from a stone."
7973,L34852,u289,m18,DUDE,That don't do us any good.
7974,L34851,u287,m18,CLUETT,"I'm sorry, Dude, butI"
7975,L34850,u289,m18,DUDE,"Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough."
7976,L34849,u287,m18,CLUETT,I haven't got it.
7977,L34848,u289,m18,DUDE,That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
7978,L34847,u287,m18,CLUETT,"I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!"
7979,L34846,u289,m18,DUDE,"You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?"
7980,L35079,u287,m18,CLUETT,What are you doing here?
7981,L35078,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Why, Matt!"
7982,L35077,u287,m18,CLUETT,I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
7983,L35076,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
7984,L35075,u287,m18,CLUETT,"And now fair woman, I have you in my power."
7985,L35074,u287,m18,CLUETT,A misunderstood bachelor.
7986,L35073,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]"
7987,L35072,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife."
7988,L35071,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class."
7989,L35070,u287,m18,CLUETT,Good for you. Come on.
7990,L35069,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink."
7991,L35068,u287,m18,CLUETT,What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
7992,L35067,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
7993,L35066,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go."
7994,L35065,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
7995,L35064,u287,m18,CLUETT,My apartment.
7996,L35063,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,What's this?
7997,L34950,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,Cyril!
7998,L34949,u287,m18,CLUETT,"No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer"
7999,L34948,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Why, Cyril, you're insane"
8000,L34947,u287,m18,CLUETT,"I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson."
8001,L34946,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Now wait a minute, wait a minute..."
8002,L34945,u287,m18,CLUETT,Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
8003,L34944,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,What?
8004,L34943,u287,m18,CLUETT,I want to be near you!
8005,L34942,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,No.
8006,L34941,u287,m18,CLUETT,Don't you know?
8007,L34940,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,Why are you so anxious?
8008,L34939,u287,m18,CLUETT,"No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me."
8009,L34938,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death."
8010,L34937,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway."
8011,L34936,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
8012,L34935,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Well, aren't you going to invite me?"
8013,L34934,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Well, what?"
8014,L34933,u287,m18,CLUETT,Well
8015,L34932,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months."
8016,L34930,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!"
8017,L34929,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly."
8018,L34911,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"See, we're getting along famously!"
8019,L34910,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?"
8020,L34909,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,Doesn't that come next?
8021,L34907,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?"
8022,L34906,u287,m18,CLUETT,"But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned."
8023,L34905,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married."
8024,L34904,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
8025,L34903,u287,m18,CLUETT,Line?
8026,L34902,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line."
8027,L34901,u287,m18,CLUETT,"If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would."
8028,L34900,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!"
8029,L34899,u287,m18,CLUETT,What is?
8030,L34898,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks"
8031,L34897,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
8032,L34896,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Well, you can. You always could."
8033,L34895,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you ."
8034,L34894,u287,m18,CLUETT,Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
8035,L34893,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,Me?
8036,L34892,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . ."
8037,L34891,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
8038,L34887,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Why, I needed a"
8039,L34886,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
8040,L35101,u297,m18,MATT,I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
8041,L35100,u287,m18,CLUETT,That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
8042,L35099,u297,m18,MATT,This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
8043,L35098,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business."
8044,L35096,u297,m18,MATT,"No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him."
8045,L35095,u287,m18,CLUETT,"I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion."
8046,L35094,u297,m18,MATT,"You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble."
8047,L35093,u287,m18,CLUETT,I'm not interested in what you think.
8048,L35089,u297,m18,MATT,"Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson."
8049,L35088,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning."
8050,L35086,u297,m18,MATT,"It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone."
8051,L35085,u287,m18,CLUETT,I'm listening.
8052,L35084,u297,m18,MATT,"Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you."
8053,L35081,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Oh, yeah?"
8054,L35080,u297,m18,MATT,The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
8055,L35055,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Yes, now."
8056,L35054,u297,m18,MATT,Now?
8057,L35053,u287,m18,CLUETT,"Let me see your cash book, will you?"
8058,L35052,u297,m18,MATT,"Yes, sir."
8059,L35051,u287,m18,CLUETT,Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
8060,L35569,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too."
8061,L35568,u290,m18,GARDINER,"Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning."
8062,L35149,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Of course, let them in! You're late now."
8063,L35148,u290,m18,GARDINER,Shall we let the people come in?
8064,L34738,u290,m18,GARDINER,Thank you!
8065,L34737,u288,m18,DICKSON,That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
8066,L34736,u290,m18,GARDINER,I'm feeling fine this morning.
8067,L34735,u288,m18,DICKSON,Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
8068,L34734,u290,m18,GARDINER,Excuse me
8069,L34733,u288,m18,DICKSON,Got a handkerchief?
8070,L34732,u290,m18,GARDINER,"Much better this morning, thank you."
8071,L34731,u288,m18,DICKSON,"John, how's your wife this morning?"
8072,L34730,u290,m18,GARDINER,"Good morning, Mr. Dickson."
8073,L35471,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . ."
8074,L35470,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?"
8075,L35469,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . ."
8076,L35468,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?"
8077,L35012,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,No.
8078,L35011,u288,m18,DICKSON,Happy now?
8079,L35010,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
8080,L35006,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,Tomorrow night?
8081,L35005,u288,m18,DICKSON,Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
8082,L35004,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,Well . . .
8083,L35003,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . ."
8084,L35002,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some."
8085,L35001,u288,m18,DICKSON,Ho! Ho! Ho!
8086,L35000,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
8087,L34999,u288,m18,DICKSON,You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
8088,L34998,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Yes, of course."
8089,L34997,u288,m18,DICKSON,"That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?"
8090,L34996,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,The theatre?
8091,L34995,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time."
8092,L34994,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing."
8093,L34993,u288,m18,DICKSON,"But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting."
8094,L34992,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it."
8095,L34991,u288,m18,DICKSON,"I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear."
8096,L34990,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,Yes.
8097,L34989,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?"
8098,L34988,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight."
8099,L34987,u288,m18,DICKSON,What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
8100,L34970,u288,m18,DICKSON,Oooh! That has the earmarks!
8101,L34969,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you."
8102,L34968,u288,m18,DICKSON,"If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!"
8103,L34967,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Hello, darling."
8104,L34966,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Well, look who's here! Hello, dear."
8105,L35585,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon."
8106,L35584,u292,m18,HELEN,Oh!
8107,L35578,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!"
8108,L35577,u292,m18,HELEN,Good morning.
8109,L35576,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Good morning, Helen."
8110,L35488,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Numbers? No, never mind."
8111,L35487,u292,m18,HELEN,"You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?"
8112,L35350,u292,m18,HELEN,"Yes, sir."
8113,L35349,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can."
8114,L35153,u288,m18,DICKSON,Now don't you worry about it.
8115,L35152,u292,m18,HELEN,In Mr. Sampson's office.
8116,L35151,u288,m18,DICKSON,Where is he now?
8117,L35150,u292,m18,HELEN,"Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!"
8118,L34926,u292,m18,HELEN,"Yes, sir."
8119,L34925,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Helen, tell Matt I want to see him."
8120,L34775,u288,m18,DICKSON,"I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either."
8121,L34774,u292,m18,HELEN,Longer.
8122,L34773,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Directors, eh? Long faces?"
8123,L34772,u292,m18,HELEN,"Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room."
8124,L34771,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?"
8125,L34770,u292,m18,HELEN,"Why - well, I"
8126,L34769,u288,m18,DICKSON,Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
8127,L34768,u292,m18,HELEN,I don't know.
8128,L34767,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?"
8129,L34766,u292,m18,HELEN,Good morning.
8130,L35467,u288,m18,DICKSON,Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
8131,L35466,u293,m18,HELEN'S VOICE,Yes?
8132,L35465,u288,m18,DICKSON,Helen!
8133,L35018,u288,m18,DICKSON,All right. Send him in.
8134,L35017,u293,m18,HELEN'S VOICE,Mr. Sampson . . .
8135,L35016,u288,m18,DICKSON,Yes?
8136,L34986,u293,m18,HELEN'S VOICE,"Yes, sir."
8137,L34985,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?"
8138,L34984,u293,m18,HELEN'S VOICE,Yes?
8139,L34782,u288,m18,DICKSON,Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
8140,L34781,u301,m18,MRS. PEMBROKE,"But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty."
8141,L34777,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . ."
8142,L34776,u301,m18,MRS. PEMBROKE,Mr. Dickson?
8143,L34765,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Hello, Helen."
8144,L34764,u301,m18,MRS. PEMBROKE,"Yes, thank you."
8145,L34763,u288,m18,DICKSON,Got my letter?
8146,L34762,u301,m18,MRS. PEMBROKE,"Good morning, Mr. Dickson."
8147,L34761,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke."
8148,L35574,u295,m18,JANITOR,I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
8149,L35573,u288,m18,DICKSON,Looks good. How much did it cost?
8150,L35572,u295,m18,JANITOR,"Yes, sir."
8151,L35571,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?"
8152,L34793,u295,m18,JANITOR,"Yes, sir."
8153,L34792,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Oh, make that uniform blue."
8154,L34757,u288,m18,DICKSON,You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
8155,L34756,u295,m18,JANITOR,"Why, I don't know."
8156,L34755,u288,m18,DICKSON,"My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?"
8157,L34754,u295,m18,JANITOR,"No, sir."
8158,L34753,u288,m18,DICKSON,You haven't got a uniform?
8159,L34752,u295,m18,JANITOR,I haven't any.
8160,L34751,u288,m18,DICKSON,Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
8161,L35583,u297,m18,MATT,"Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson"
8162,L35582,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week."
8163,L35581,u288,m18,DICKSON,"I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you."
8164,L35580,u297,m18,MATT,But I haven't . . .
8165,L35579,u288,m18,DICKSON,I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
8166,L35505,u288,m18,DICKSON,"All right. That's all.  Please, Matt."
8167,L35504,u297,m18,MATT,"Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and"
8168,L35503,u288,m18,DICKSON,"She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?"
8169,L35502,u297,m18,MATT,Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
8170,L35501,u288,m18,DICKSON,Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
8171,L35500,u297,m18,MATT,"Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is"
8172,L35499,u288,m18,DICKSON,Was Mrs. Dickson there?
8173,L35498,u297,m18,MATT,"Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?"
8174,L35497,u288,m18,DICKSON,Were you in Cluett's apartment?
8175,L35496,u297,m18,MATT,"You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?"
8176,L35495,u288,m18,DICKSON,Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
8177,L35494,u297,m18,MATT,"We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late."
8178,L35308,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?"
8179,L35307,u297,m18,MATT,"No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!"
8180,L35306,u288,m18,DICKSON,You're protecting somebody.
8181,L35305,u297,m18,MATT,No. I won't.
8182,L35303,u297,m18,MATT,I can't tell you.
8183,L35302,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?"
8184,L35173,u288,m18,DICKSON,There you are.
8185,L35172,u297,m18,MATT,I already told him I was home.
8186,L34965,u288,m18,DICKSON,"I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?"
8187,L34964,u297,m18,MATT,"Well, I"
8188,L34963,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?"
8189,L34962,u297,m18,MATT,"Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough."
8190,L34961,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real."
8191,L34960,u297,m18,MATT,"Sure, I think it's swell."
8192,L34959,u288,m18,DICKSON,What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
8193,L34958,u288,m18,DICKSON,"And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?"
8194,L34957,u297,m18,MATT,It's all right. Thanks.
8195,L35464,u288,m18,DICKSON,You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
8196,L35463,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away."
8197,L35462,u288,m18,DICKSON,You're lying!
8198,L35457,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
8199,L35456,u288,m18,DICKSON,My wife? What's she got to do with you?
8200,L35438,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
8201,L35437,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years."
8202,L35436,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man."
8203,L35298,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?"
8204,L35297,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Of course it's true - and he knows it.
8205,L35241,u288,m18,DICKSON,So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
8206,L35240,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record."
8207,L35239,u288,m18,DICKSON,What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
8208,L35238,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty."
8209,L35175,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little."
8210,L35174,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
8211,L35171,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right."
8212,L35170,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"If he can do it, yes."
8213,L35169,u288,m18,DICKSON,"All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?"
8214,L35168,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
8215,L35167,u288,m18,DICKSON,What time did this thing happen?
8216,L35159,u288,m18,DICKSON,Yes.
8217,L35158,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?"
8218,L35157,u288,m18,DICKSON,Why pick on him ?
8219,L35156,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson."
8220,L35155,u288,m18,DICKSON,What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
8221,L35348,u288,m18,DICKSON,"I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet."
8222,L35347,u304,m18,SAMPSON,"Yes, sir."
8223,L35346,u288,m18,DICKSON,Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
8224,L35345,u304,m18,SAMPSON,Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
8225,L35327,u288,m18,DICKSON,Don't you think I know it?
8226,L35326,u304,m18,SAMPSON,We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
8227,L35317,u288,m18,DICKSON,"I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature."
8228,L35316,u304,m18,SAMPSON,What'll we do?
8229,L35315,u288,m18,DICKSON,"The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads."
8230,L35314,u304,m18,SAMPSON,"Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place."
8231,L35313,u288,m18,DICKSON,Mine too?
8232,L35312,u304,m18,SAMPSON,"Yes, sir."
8233,L35311,u288,m18,DICKSON,Did you get the case for the securities?
8234,L35310,u304,m18,SAMPSON,"Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy."
8235,L35253,u304,m18,SAMPSON,"Yes, sir."
8236,L35252,u288,m18,DICKSON,"The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot."
8237,L35251,u304,m18,SAMPSON,"We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors."
8238,L35250,u288,m18,DICKSON,All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
8239,L35249,u304,m18,SAMPSON,They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
8240,L35247,u288,m18,DICKSON,What are you talking about?
8241,L35246,u304,m18,SAMPSON,The lobby's half filled now.
8242,L35026,u304,m18,SAMPSON,"Yes, sir."
8243,L35025,u288,m18,DICKSON,"How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off."
8244,L35024,u304,m18,SAMPSON,He says he can't get away in the daytime.
8245,L35023,u288,m18,DICKSON,That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
8246,L35022,u304,m18,SAMPSON,I'm afraid he's been stalling.
8247,L35021,u288,m18,DICKSON,Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
8248,L35020,u304,m18,SAMPSON,Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
8249,L35019,u288,m18,DICKSON,"Well, Sampson, what is it?"
8250,L35395,u291,m18,GUARD,"Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!"
8251,L35394,u296,m18,LADY,"But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!"
8252,L35393,u291,m18,GUARD,"Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right."
8253,L34809,u296,m18,LADY,"It's his life insurance money, you know."
8254,L34808,u291,m18,GUARD,Absolutely.
8255,L34807,u296,m18,LADY,Is it safe?
8256,L34806,u291,m18,GUARD,"Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here."
8257,L34877,u292,m18,HELEN,All right.
8258,L34876,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!"
8259,L34875,u292,m18,HELEN,Hardly.
8260,L34874,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?"
8261,L34873,u292,m18,HELEN,No.
8262,L34872,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?"
8263,L34871,u292,m18,HELEN,I'm afraid so.
8264,L34870,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,"Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose."
8265,L34869,u292,m18,HELEN,He's at a board meeting.
8266,L34868,u299,m18,MRS. DICKSON,Is that busy husband of mine busy?
8267,L34867,u292,m18,HELEN,"How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson."
8268,L35523,u292,m18,HELEN,"Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!"
8269,L35522,u297,m18,MATT,"The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?"
8270,L35521,u292,m18,HELEN,Mr. Williams . . .
8271,L35520,u297,m18,MATT,Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
8272,L35507,u297,m18,MATT,"Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone."
8273,L35506,u292,m18,HELEN,Did you talk to him?
8274,L35493,u297,m18,MATT,"Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him."
8275,L35492,u292,m18,HELEN,Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
8276,L35491,u297,m18,MATT,They must have turned him down.
8277,L35490,u292,m18,HELEN,Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
8278,L35489,u297,m18,MATT,"What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?"
8279,L35369,u297,m18,MATT,"Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right."
8280,L35368,u292,m18,HELEN,"Oh, Matt . . ."
8281,L35042,u297,m18,MATT,"All right, dear."
8282,L35041,u292,m18,HELEN,Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
8283,L35040,u297,m18,MATT,"Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that"
8284,L35039,u292,m18,HELEN,"Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in."
8285,L35038,u297,m18,MATT,Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
8286,L35037,u292,m18,HELEN,"Oh now, don't be silly."
8287,L35036,u297,m18,MATT,"Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]"
8288,L35035,u292,m18,HELEN,"Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?"
8289,L35034,u297,m18,MATT,"Oh, Charlie again."
8290,L35033,u292,m18,HELEN,What's keeping you?
8291,L34981,u297,m18,MATT,"Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy."
8292,L34980,u292,m18,HELEN,In Cluett's office?
8293,L34979,u297,m18,MATT,"I tell you, I saw them!"
8294,L34978,u292,m18,HELEN,"Oh Matt, you must be mistaken."
8295,L34977,u297,m18,MATT,"Well, he was making love to her."
8296,L34976,u292,m18,HELEN,Well . . . ?
8297,L34975,u297,m18,MATT,"Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there."
8298,L34974,u292,m18,HELEN,"What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death."
8299,L34973,u297,m18,MATT,Yeah.
8300,L34972,u292,m18,HELEN,What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
8301,L34955,u297,m18,MATT,"Yeah, swell."
8302,L34954,u292,m18,HELEN,"Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?"
8303,L34704,u292,m18,HELEN,"Oh, Matt."
8304,L34703,u297,m18,MATT,"All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar."
8305,L34702,u292,m18,HELEN,Yes.
8306,L34701,u297,m18,MATT,"Oh, you think I'm lying?"
8307,L34700,u292,m18,HELEN,No.
8308,L34699,u297,m18,MATT,"A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?"
8309,L34698,u292,m18,HELEN,Yes.
8310,L34697,u297,m18,MATT,"Oh, ten dollars"
8311,L34696,u292,m18,HELEN,The ten dollars.
8312,L34695,u297,m18,MATT,With what?
8313,L34694,u292,m18,HELEN,What did you do with it?
8314,L34651,u292,m18,HELEN,"Oh, is that so?"
8315,L34650,u297,m18,MATT,"Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!"
8316,L34649,u292,m18,HELEN,"Come here, honey!"
8317,L34648,u297,m18,MATT,Why?
8318,L34647,u292,m18,HELEN,"Matt, come here!"
8319,L34646,u297,m18,MATT,"Hello, Helen!"
8320,L35385,u292,m18,HELEN,"Yes, sir."
8321,L35384,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Are you sure?
8322,L35383,u292,m18,HELEN,He came to see Mr. Cluett.
8323,L35382,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,He was here?
8324,L35381,u292,m18,HELEN,He was in the bank yesterday.
8325,L35380,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"Yes, why?"
8326,L35379,u292,m18,HELEN,Did you say Dude Finlay?
8327,L35376,u298,m18,MIKE,"Yes, sir."
8328,L35375,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Dude Finlay?
8329,L35374,u298,m18,MIKE,He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
8330,L35373,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Never mind all that. What did you find out?
8331,L35372,u298,m18,MIKE,"I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere."
8332,L35371,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"What did you find out, Mike?"
8333,L35294,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks."
8334,L35293,u300,m18,MRS. HALLIGAN,"Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it"
8335,L35290,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,There you are!
8336,L35289,u300,m18,MRS. HALLIGAN,"No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one."
8337,L35288,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet."
8338,L35287,u300,m18,MRS. HALLIGAN,No. It wasn't earlier because...
8339,L35286,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,It couldn't have been earlier?
8340,L35285,u300,m18,MRS. HALLIGAN,"Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause..."
8341,L35282,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Was it twelve o'clock?
8342,L35281,u300,m18,MRS. HALLIGAN,"That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . ."
8343,L35280,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
8344,L35279,u300,m18,MRS. HALLIGAN,"Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after"
8345,L35278,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,What time did Matt Brown get in?
8346,L35277,u300,m18,MRS. HALLIGAN,Huh?
8347,L35276,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,What time was it?
8348,L35275,u300,m18,MRS. HALLIGAN,"It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know."
8349,L35274,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?"
8350,L35273,u300,m18,MRS. HALLIGAN,"for the rheumatism, you know."
8351,L35269,u300,m18,MRS. HALLIGAN,Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
8352,L35268,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?"
8353,L35301,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Then where were you?
8354,L35300,u297,m18,MATT,"But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . ."
8355,L35266,u297,m18,MATT,Yes.
8356,L35265,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?"
8357,L35264,u297,m18,MATT,"Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock."
8358,L35263,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,What time did you get in?
8359,L35262,u297,m18,MATT,Yes.
8360,L35261,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,So you were home last night?
8361,L35165,u297,m18,MATT,I don't know.
8362,L35164,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,Then who changed it?
8363,L35142,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"You used to carry a gun, didn't you?"
8364,L35141,u297,m18,MATT,I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
8365,L35140,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?"
8366,L35139,u297,m18,MATT,wasn't anywhere near this place
8367,L35138,u294,m18,INSPECTOR,"You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?"
8368,L35527,u297,m18,MATT,"They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it."
8369,L35526,u305,m18,TELLER,"Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!"
8370,L35031,u305,m18,TELLER,"Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it."
8371,L35030,u297,m18,MATT,Where's Charlie?
8372,L35029,u305,m18,TELLER,I guess so.
8373,L35028,u297,m18,MATT,Everybody in?
8374,L34645,u297,m18,MATT,Bought himself a pocketbook!
8375,L34644,u305,m18,TELLER,"Yeah, what did he do with his first one?"
8376,L34643,u297,m18,MATT,That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
8377,L34620,u297,m18,MATT,You've got enough?
8378,L34619,u305,m18,TELLER,"I'm okay, Matt."
8379,L34618,u297,m18,MATT,How are you fixed?
8380,L34617,u305,m18,TELLER,"Okay, Matt."
8381,L34616,u297,m18,MATT,"You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight."
8382,L36304,u306,m19,BOB,Now you tell us.
8383,L36303,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,Sometimes a wound will kill.
8384,L36302,u306,m19,BOB,This is healing?
8385,L35843,u306,m19,BOB,"Jim Younger, I told you--"
8386,L35842,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,I couldn't lose him.
8387,L35692,u306,m19,BOB,"Tom, I'm this close to coming with you..."
8388,L35691,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,I think I may just go on to the reservation.
8389,L35643,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,"I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche."
8390,L35642,u306,m19,BOB,You can ride like that?
8391,L36521,u306,m19,BOB,It's tougher than it looks.
8392,L36520,u308,m19,COLE,He's not bad at it.
8393,L36519,u306,m19,BOB,"Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says ""Let's ride."""
8394,L36427,u308,m19,COLE,You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
8395,L36426,u306,m19,BOB,"I'm sorry, Cole."
8396,L36424,u306,m19,BOB,Swear on Jimmy's grave.
8397,L36423,u308,m19,COLE,I swear --
8398,L36422,u306,m19,BOB,Swear.
8399,L36421,u308,m19,COLE,Bob. I didn't...
8400,L36420,u306,m19,BOB,WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
8401,L36419,u308,m19,COLE,I ain't done --
8402,L36418,u306,m19,BOB,What have you done?
8403,L36417,u308,m19,COLE,How'd they --
8404,L36399,u308,m19,COLE,"Leave me alone, Bob."
8405,L36398,u306,m19,BOB,"Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean."
8406,L36397,u308,m19,COLE,"As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve."
8407,L36396,u306,m19,BOB,That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
8408,L36395,u308,m19,COLE,It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
8409,L36394,u306,m19,BOB,This is the best score yet.
8410,L36292,u306,m19,BOB,What?
8411,L36291,u308,m19,COLE,"That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick."
8412,L36177,u306,m19,BOB,"Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out."
8413,L36176,u308,m19,COLE,"We got a problem here, brother?"
8414,L36132,u306,m19,BOB,"Say we bust into a bank. We yell ""We're the Younger-James Gang!"" People are gonna be thinking, ""The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?"" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms."
8415,L36131,u308,m19,COLE,How?
8416,L36130,u306,m19,BOB,"No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing."
8417,L36043,u308,m19,COLE,"You stay out of this, Bob."
8418,L36042,u306,m19,BOB,"Uhh, yeah it does."
8419,L36034,u306,m19,BOB,Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
8420,L36033,u308,m19,COLE,These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
8421,L35966,u308,m19,COLE,I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
8422,L35965,u306,m19,BOB,The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
8423,L35964,u308,m19,COLE,"Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite."
8424,L35920,u306,m19,BOB,"Zee, I'm pleased you came."
8425,L35919,u308,m19,COLE,"Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin."
8426,L35747,u308,m19,COLE,That was two hours ago.
8427,L35746,u306,m19,BOB,Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
8428,L35663,u306,m19,BOB,Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
8429,L35662,u308,m19,COLE,Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
8430,L35622,u308,m19,COLE,Never a good thing.
8431,L35621,u306,m19,BOB,He's smiling.
8432,L35590,u306,m19,BOB,"Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!"
8433,L35589,u308,m19,COLE,Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
8434,L35836,u306,m19,BOB,Tomorrow.
8435,L35835,u312,m19,FRANK,The Army can hang him.
8436,L35834,u306,m19,BOB,They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
8437,L35833,u312,m19,FRANK,Damn!
8438,L35830,u306,m19,BOB,He just lost his temper a little.
8439,L35829,u312,m19,FRANK,Oh no...
8440,L35828,u306,m19,BOB,"They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper."
8441,L35690,u312,m19,FRANK,"Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms."
8442,L35689,u306,m19,BOB,"Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay."
8443,L35681,u306,m19,BOB,... Will Perry ...
8444,L35680,u312,m19,FRANK,"Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ..."
8445,L35668,u306,m19,BOB,Then I love it.
8446,L35667,u312,m19,FRANK,Nope.
8447,L35666,u306,m19,BOB,Corn gonna shoot at me?
8448,L35656,u306,m19,BOB,"Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!"
8449,L35655,u312,m19,FRANK,Yesterday.
8450,L35619,u312,m19,FRANK,I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
8451,L35618,u306,m19,BOB,"My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you."
8452,L36276,u313,m19,JESSE,Tell me.
8453,L36275,u306,m19,BOB,"Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble..."
8454,L36274,u313,m19,JESSE,What?
8455,L36273,u306,m19,BOB,He's planning a job.
8456,L36272,u313,m19,JESSE,He's been full of vinegar lately.
8457,L36271,u306,m19,BOB,"Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole."
8458,L36270,u313,m19,JESSE,You are a fine figure of a man.
8459,L36269,u306,m19,BOB,The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
8460,L36179,u306,m19,BOB,Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
8461,L36178,u313,m19,JESSE,"This is about the ""Wanted!"" Posters, isn't it."
8462,L36173,u306,m19,BOB,"You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!"
8463,L36172,u313,m19,JESSE,Beg pardon?
8464,L36171,u306,m19,BOB,One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
8465,L36170,u313,m19,JESSE,"Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go..."
8466,L36068,u313,m19,JESSE,"""Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."""
8467,L36067,u306,m19,BOB,Hey!
8468,L36066,u313,m19,JESSE,"""The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."""
8469,L36037,u313,m19,JESSE,"We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there."
8470,L36036,u306,m19,BOB,"Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him."
8471,L36035,u313,m19,JESSE,"All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours."
8472,L35973,u313,m19,JESSE,Exactly.
8473,L35972,u306,m19,BOB,But if we take their money and supplies...
8474,L35924,u306,m19,BOB,Not yet. But I'm hoping.
8475,L35923,u313,m19,JESSE,You have no shame.
8476,L35832,u306,m19,BOB,Two.
8477,L35831,u313,m19,JESSE,How many of them did he kill?
8478,L35659,u306,m19,BOB,Best damn plan I heard all war.
8479,L35658,u313,m19,JESSE,"Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again."
8480,L36486,u313,m19,JESSE,"No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --"
8481,L36485,u307,m19,BURLY DETECTIVE,"You shut up now, boy."
8482,L36484,u313,m19,JESSE,I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
8483,L36483,u307,m19,BURLY DETECTIVE,How?
8484,L36482,u313,m19,JESSE,I think I recognize you.
8485,L36481,u307,m19,BURLY DETECTIVE,What you sayin' boy?
8486,L36480,u313,m19,JESSE,"You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!"
8487,L36479,u307,m19,BURLY DETECTIVE,What?
8488,L36523,u308,m19,COLE,We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
8489,L36522,u313,m19,JESSE,Where'd you get all these riders?
8490,L36518,u313,m19,JESSE,"Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind."
8491,L36517,u308,m19,COLE,"You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --"
8492,L36516,u313,m19,JESSE,"Missed you too, cousin."
8493,L36515,u308,m19,COLE,"Missed you, cousin."
8494,L36353,u313,m19,JESSE,Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
8495,L36352,u308,m19,COLE,"WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!"
8496,L36351,u313,m19,JESSE,I'm out.
8497,L36350,u308,m19,COLE,We'll make them pay for this.
8498,L36335,u313,m19,JESSE,Pass me some whisky.
8499,L36334,u308,m19,COLE,"Bob, rip up some bandages."
8500,L36331,u308,m19,COLE,"Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!"
8501,L36330,u313,m19,JESSE,"Okay, you're gonna rest here."
8502,L36320,u313,m19,JESSE,A trap.
8503,L36319,u308,m19,COLE,Dammit!
8504,L36314,u308,m19,COLE,"You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!"
8505,L36313,u313,m19,JESSE,Fine. We hit this bank.
8506,L36312,u308,m19,COLE,"Then let me run the show, General Lee."
8507,L36311,u313,m19,JESSE,Still smells fishy.
8508,L36307,u313,m19,JESSE,And I'm the better outlaw.
8509,L36306,u308,m19,COLE,"I'm the better soldier, Jesse."
8510,L36300,u308,m19,COLE,That's it.
8511,L36299,u313,m19,JESSE,And almost got hanged in peacetime.
8512,L36298,u308,m19,COLE,I got us through the War all right.
8513,L36297,u313,m19,JESSE,A bad idea.
8514,L36296,u308,m19,COLE,Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
8515,L36295,u313,m19,JESSE,Beautiful.
8516,L36284,u313,m19,JESSE,You're forgetting who's in charge --
8517,L36283,u308,m19,COLE,"I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job."
8518,L36282,u313,m19,JESSE,What are you saying?
8519,L36281,u308,m19,COLE,"If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems."
8520,L36280,u313,m19,JESSE,"Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper."
8521,L36278,u313,m19,JESSE,What will be?
8522,L36277,u308,m19,COLE,It'll be the biggest score yet.
8523,L36181,u313,m19,JESSE,"Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang."
8524,L36180,u308,m19,COLE,This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
8525,L36127,u308,m19,COLE,"Why aren't we the ""Younger-James Gang""? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here."
8526,L36126,u313,m19,JESSE,Yep.
8527,L36125,u308,m19,COLE,"All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the ""James-Younger Gang."""
8528,L36124,u313,m19,JESSE,"Sure, cousin."
8529,L36123,u308,m19,COLE,"Jesse, we got to have a word."
8530,L36063,u308,m19,COLE,Twenty?!
8531,L36062,u313,m19,JESSE,"""The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."""
8532,L36057,u313,m19,JESSE,It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
8533,L36056,u308,m19,COLE,It's not a bank.
8534,L36041,u308,m19,COLE,Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
8535,L36040,u313,m19,JESSE,"See, Frank's being smart about this."
8536,L36030,u308,m19,COLE,I got three.
8537,L36029,u313,m19,JESSE,I got seven thousand.
8538,L36001,u308,m19,COLE,Don't let it happen again.
8539,L36000,u313,m19,JESSE,Sorry.
8540,L35999,u308,m19,COLE,The James-Younger Gang.
8541,L35979,u308,m19,COLE,Let's ride.
8542,L35978,u313,m19,JESSE,"Perfect, Cole."
8543,L35977,u308,m19,COLE,I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
8544,L35971,u313,m19,JESSE,"Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care."
8545,L35970,u308,m19,COLE,"So what do we do, General Lee?"
8546,L35969,u313,m19,JESSE,"This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day."
8547,L35776,u313,m19,JESSE,Yeah.
8548,L35775,u308,m19,COLE,"Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns."
8549,L35774,u313,m19,JESSE,But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
8550,L35773,u308,m19,COLE,It was exciting.
8551,L35772,u313,m19,JESSE,"The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it."
8552,L35771,u308,m19,COLE,"After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?"
8553,L35770,u313,m19,JESSE,Thanks for the help.
8554,L35763,u313,m19,JESSE,"All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --"
8555,L35762,u308,m19,COLE,She was European!
8556,L35761,u313,m19,JESSE,She had a moustache.
8557,L35754,u308,m19,COLE,She got two of them.
8558,L35753,u313,m19,JESSE,You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
8559,L35688,u313,m19,JESSE,"In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming."
8560,L35687,u308,m19,COLE,What is wrong with you?
8561,L35686,u313,m19,JESSE,Not now.
8562,L35678,u313,m19,JESSE,"Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that."
8563,L35677,u308,m19,COLE,"You're not scared, are you?"
8564,L35676,u313,m19,JESSE,"Hands off your hip, Cole."
8565,L35665,u308,m19,COLE,Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
8566,L35664,u313,m19,JESSE,"Home, boys. Back to our farms."
8567,L35653,u313,m19,JESSE,There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
8568,L35652,u308,m19,COLE,Where you boys going?
8569,L35646,u308,m19,COLE,"Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!"
8570,L35645,u313,m19,JESSE,I could use the walk.
8571,L35644,u308,m19,COLE,"Ride with me, cousin?"
8572,L35615,u313,m19,JESSE,What's going on?
8573,L35614,u308,m19,COLE,"'Bout time you got here, buddy."
8574,L35672,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,I'm thinking...
8575,L35671,u308,m19,COLE,Well?
8576,L35670,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,"Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you..."
8577,L35669,u308,m19,COLE,"Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want."
8578,L35641,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,You ride like a Comanche.
8579,L35640,u308,m19,COLE,"Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!"
8580,L35596,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
8581,L35595,u308,m19,COLE,"Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom."
8582,L36323,u312,m19,FRANK,They're just insurance in case we run.
8583,L36322,u308,m19,COLE,They gonna rush us?
8584,L36321,u312,m19,FRANK,Another dozen out back.
8585,L36287,u312,m19,FRANK,"Cole, he didn't mean that."
8586,L36286,u308,m19,COLE,"Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?"
8587,L36285,u312,m19,FRANK,Jesse.
8588,L36053,u308,m19,COLE,-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
8589,L36052,u312,m19,FRANK,Strategically.
8590,L36051,u308,m19,COLE,"Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --"
8591,L35947,u312,m19,FRANK,Get buckets!
8592,L35946,u308,m19,COLE,BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
8593,L35768,u308,m19,COLE,Ah.
8594,L35767,u312,m19,FRANK,Shakespeare.  He's European.
8595,L35766,u308,m19,COLE,"I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice."
8596,L35760,u308,m19,COLE,Sadie was not a man!
8597,L35759,u312,m19,FRANK,"Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's..."
8598,L35757,u312,m19,FRANK,The brown one.
8599,L35756,u308,m19,COLE,"Which one, right or left?"
8600,L35755,u312,m19,FRANK,I think one of 'em's glass.
8601,L35675,u312,m19,FRANK,"Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys."
8602,L35674,u308,m19,COLE,What the --
8603,L35609,u312,m19,FRANK,"Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up."
8604,L35608,u308,m19,COLE,Both would be nice.
8605,L35607,u312,m19,FRANK,Cannon or Gatling?
8606,L36393,u325,m19,TELLER,"All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk..."
8607,L36392,u308,m19,COLE,OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
8608,L36389,u308,m19,COLE,This here is the Younger Gang!
8609,L36388,u325,m19,TELLER,Where is Jesse James?
8610,L36387,u308,m19,COLE,What?
8611,L36386,u325,m19,TELLER,"Of course!  Uh, sir?"
8612,L36385,u308,m19,COLE,The safe. Now.
8613,L36147,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,Me get heap firewater --
8614,L36146,u318,m19,MARSHALL,Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
8615,L36144,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,Ho-yah!
8616,L36143,u318,m19,MARSHALL,East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
8617,L36142,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,"Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock."
8618,L36141,u318,m19,MARSHALL,Of St. Louis?
8619,L36140,u318,m19,MARSHALL,The District Marshall
8620,L36139,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
8621,L36138,u318,m19,MARSHALL,"Yeah, Injun. What do you want?"
8622,L36137,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,You 'um big lawman?
8623,L36015,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,I'd appreciate that.
8624,L36014,u319,m19,OLD MAN,Fine. I'll just wait here.
8625,L36013,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,It's a secret.
8626,L36012,u319,m19,OLD MAN,Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
8627,L36011,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,On account of we're robbing it.
8628,L36010,u319,m19,OLD MAN,Then why can't I go in there?
8629,L36009,u309,m19,COMANCHE TOM,"You're right, sir."
8630,L36008,u319,m19,OLD MAN,I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
8631,L36028,u324,m19,SHERRIFF,Shit.
8632,L36027,u310,m19,DEPUTY,I had you covered.  From back there.
8633,L36026,u324,m19,SHERRIFF,Where the hell were you?
8634,L36020,u324,m19,SHERRIFF,When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
8635,L36019,u310,m19,DEPUTY,So?
8636,L36018,u324,m19,SHERRIFF,Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
8637,L36017,u310,m19,DEPUTY,What is it?
8638,L36016,u324,m19,SHERRIFF,What the --
8639,L35915,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,"It's fine by me, Jesse."
8640,L35914,u313,m19,JESSE,"Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out."
8641,L35913,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,You know you're welcome any time!
8642,L35910,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
8643,L35909,u313,m19,JESSE,"What do you say, sir?"
8644,L35841,u313,m19,JESSE,"Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys."
8645,L35840,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,Boys...
8646,L35710,u313,m19,JESSE,Died a hero.
8647,L35709,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,Web died fighting?
8648,L35706,u313,m19,JESSE,"Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them."
8649,L35705,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,My little Web did that?
8650,L35704,u313,m19,JESSE,"-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee."
8651,L36104,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,"I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck."
8652,L36103,u326,m19,ZEE,He thinks this is some kind of game!
8653,L35877,u326,m19,ZEE,I think he's already feeling better.
8654,L35876,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,"Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning."
8655,L35875,u326,m19,ZEE,I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
8656,L35874,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,They're gone. What are you --
8657,L35863,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,"The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt."
8658,L35862,u326,m19,ZEE,"He's going to be fine, right Daddy?"
8659,L35717,u311,m19,DOC MIMMS,"Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?"
8660,L35716,u326,m19,ZEE,"Daddy, don't start with this again."
8661,L36529,u312,m19,FRANK,"Hell, they hardly even noticed us."
8662,L36528,u313,m19,JESSE,"See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there."
8663,L36527,u312,m19,FRANK,I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
8664,L36349,u312,m19,FRANK,I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
8665,L36348,u313,m19,JESSE,A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
8666,L36347,u312,m19,FRANK,Yeah.
8667,L36346,u313,m19,JESSE,You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
8668,L36345,u312,m19,FRANK,Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
8669,L36344,u313,m19,JESSE,He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
8670,L36343,u312,m19,FRANK,Jim was old enough...
8671,L36342,u313,m19,JESSE,"Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim."
8672,L36326,u312,m19,FRANK,"Got any ideas, little brother?"
8673,L36325,u313,m19,JESSE,They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
8674,L36289,u312,m19,FRANK,"No, I --"
8675,L36288,u313,m19,JESSE,"You taking sides against me, now, Frank?"
8676,L36212,u312,m19,FRANK,Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
8677,L36211,u313,m19,JESSE,Oh yeah.
8678,L36210,u312,m19,FRANK,We're drunk.
8679,L36206,u312,m19,FRANK,A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
8680,L36205,u313,m19,JESSE,"What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming."
8681,L36204,u312,m19,FRANK,Maybe it started out that way. But now...
8682,L36203,u313,m19,JESSE,We're doing this for Ma.
8683,L36202,u312,m19,FRANK,I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
8684,L36201,u313,m19,JESSE,That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
8685,L36200,u312,m19,FRANK,If I could go back to farming --
8686,L36199,u313,m19,JESSE,You've killed your fair share of men.
8687,L36198,u312,m19,FRANK,"It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now."
8688,L36197,u313,m19,JESSE,And we're good at it.
8689,L36196,u312,m19,FRANK,"Jesse, we're outlaws."
8690,L36195,u313,m19,JESSE,This has been a good year.
8691,L36188,u313,m19,JESSE,"Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang."
8692,L36187,u312,m19,FRANK,"Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!"
8693,L36184,u312,m19,FRANK,The posters?
8694,L36183,u313,m19,JESSE,Bob's upset.
8695,L36182,u312,m19,FRANK,"Gents, we are in the middle of something here."
8696,L36112,u312,m19,FRANK,It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
8697,L36111,u313,m19,JESSE,I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
8698,L36059,u313,m19,JESSE,And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
8699,L36058,u312,m19,FRANK,And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
8700,L36047,u312,m19,FRANK,"And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?"
8701,L36046,u313,m19,JESSE,And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
8702,L36023,u312,m19,FRANK,We're gonna have to talk...
8703,L36022,u313,m19,JESSE,Fine. How'd it go out here?
8704,L36021,u312,m19,FRANK,How'd it go in there?
8705,L35963,u313,m19,JESSE,Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
8706,L35962,u312,m19,FRANK,Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
8707,L35961,u313,m19,JESSE,Don't care.
8708,L35960,u312,m19,FRANK,... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
8709,L35949,u313,m19,JESSE,Ma.
8710,L35948,u312,m19,FRANK,Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
8711,L35912,u313,m19,JESSE,"Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?"
8712,L35911,u312,m19,FRANK,You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
8713,L35908,u312,m19,FRANK,"Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable."
8714,L35907,u313,m19,JESSE,What do you think?
8715,L35906,u312,m19,FRANK,You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
8716,L35811,u313,m19,JESSE,Damn. All that reading paid off.
8717,L35810,u312,m19,FRANK,"I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can."
8718,L35784,u313,m19,JESSE,Heard of him.
8719,L35783,u312,m19,FRANK,You know him?
8720,L35765,u312,m19,FRANK,"Your Zee? Hmm.  ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."""
8721,L35764,u313,m19,JESSE,-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
8722,L35752,u313,m19,JESSE,What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
8723,L35751,u312,m19,FRANK,She's still talking to Jesus.
8724,L35735,u312,m19,FRANK,"Next time try ""fat and haggard."""
8725,L35734,u313,m19,JESSE,I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
8726,L35733,u312,m19,FRANK,You are a charmer.
8727,L35732,u313,m19,JESSE,You can shut up now.
8728,L35731,u312,m19,FRANK,"""Big and older""?"
8729,L35725,u312,m19,FRANK,"Maybe, maybe..."
8730,L35724,u313,m19,JESSE,That just might work.
8731,L35722,u313,m19,JESSE,What kind of story are they going to believe?
8732,L35721,u312,m19,FRANK,"Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right."
8733,L35720,u313,m19,JESSE,"All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me."
8734,L35708,u313,m19,JESSE,"Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth."
8735,L35707,u312,m19,FRANK,Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
8736,L35702,u313,m19,JESSE,"Zee, we got to talk to you and your father."
8737,L35701,u312,m19,FRANK,You're doing just fine.
8738,L35700,u313,m19,JESSE,"Frank, don't you have something to say?"
8739,L35684,u312,m19,FRANK,"We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here."
8740,L35683,u313,m19,JESSE,Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
8741,L35661,u313,m19,JESSE,"All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle."
8742,L35660,u312,m19,FRANK,"Hello, Liberty Missoura!"
8743,L35651,u312,m19,FRANK,I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
8744,L35650,u313,m19,JESSE,Hell of a war.
8745,L35649,u312,m19,FRANK,I reckoned.
8746,L35648,u313,m19,JESSE,Web's dead.
8747,L35639,u312,m19,FRANK,"No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out."
8748,L35638,u313,m19,JESSE,"See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it."
8749,L35637,u312,m19,FRANK,I figure.
8750,L35636,u313,m19,JESSE,That would have made an impression.
8751,L35635,u312,m19,FRANK,"You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats."
8752,L35634,u313,m19,JESSE,Such as?
8753,L35633,u312,m19,FRANK,Mm-hmm.
8754,L35632,u313,m19,JESSE,So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
8755,L35631,u312,m19,FRANK,Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
8756,L35630,u313,m19,JESSE,Distracting enough for you?
8757,L35617,u313,m19,JESSE,So we got a plan?
8758,L35616,u312,m19,FRANK,"Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off."
8759,L36550,u312,m19,FRANK,Everything but the boring parts.
8760,L36549,u315,m19,JIMMY,How much of that story is true?
8761,L36548,u312,m19,FRANK,Yeah Jimmy?
8762,L36547,u315,m19,JIMMY,Uncle Frank?
8763,L36545,u312,m19,FRANK,I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
8764,L36544,u315,m19,JIMMY,So what was he?
8765,L36543,u312,m19,FRANK,Can't argue that.
8766,L36542,u315,m19,JIMMY,"But he killed a lot of men, too."
8767,L36541,u312,m19,FRANK,Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
8768,L36540,u315,m19,JIMMY,They're making him a hero now.
8769,L36539,u312,m19,FRANK,That he was.
8770,L36538,u315,m19,JIMMY,Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
8771,L36537,u312,m19,FRANK,"Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up."
8772,L36536,u312,m19,FRANK,"I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy."
8773,L36535,u315,m19,JIMMY,"...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot."
8774,L36534,u312,m19,FRANK,"Yeah, Jimmy?"
8775,L36533,u315,m19,JIMMY,"Y'know, Uncle Frank..."
8776,L35958,u317,m19,MA,Shush.
8777,L35957,u313,m19,JESSE,Doc Mimms will --
8778,L35956,u317,m19,MA,"Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers."
8779,L35955,u313,m19,JESSE,"We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms."
8780,L35954,u317,m19,MA,Riders --
8781,L35952,u317,m19,MA,Boys?
8782,L35951,u313,m19,JESSE,Ma! Please!
8783,L35804,u313,m19,JESSE,Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
8784,L35803,u317,m19,MA,"The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them."
8785,L35780,u317,m19,MA,"We're just fine, thank you, sir."
8786,L35779,u313,m19,JESSE,Easterners.
8787,L35750,u317,m19,MA,He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
8788,L35749,u313,m19,JESSE,"Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend."
8789,L35741,u317,m19,MA,Say your prayers?
8790,L35740,u313,m19,JESSE,"A fair number, Ma."
8791,L35739,u317,m19,MA,Did you kill Yankees?
8792,L36532,u313,m19,JESSE,I'll explain on the way.
8793,L36531,u326,m19,ZEE,Tennessee?
8794,L36514,u313,m19,JESSE,Yes ma'am.
8795,L36513,u326,m19,ZEE,Don't swear.
8796,L36512,u313,m19,JESSE,You are a hell of a woman.
8797,L36511,u326,m19,ZEE,I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
8798,L36510,u313,m19,JESSE,Yes ma'am.
8799,L36509,u326,m19,ZEE,"You get arrested again, I'll kill you."
8800,L36414,u326,m19,ZEE,"If you don't see it, it's not real..."
8801,L36413,u313,m19,JESSE,What?
8802,L36412,u326,m19,ZEE,Don't turn around.
8803,L36411,u313,m19,JESSE,Swimming. Swimming is good.
8804,L36410,u326,m19,ZEE,Stop it. This is just sad.
8805,L36409,u313,m19,JESSE,"Aw, shucks, ma'am..."
8806,L36408,u326,m19,ZEE,"Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?"
8807,L36407,u313,m19,JESSE,"Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?"
8808,L36406,u326,m19,ZEE,"Oh, I'm not finished.  ""When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple.""  As I said. Hmm."
8809,L36405,u313,m19,JESSE,Let me see that.
8810,L36404,u326,m19,ZEE,"""Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James."" Only a dime in the hotel lobby."
8811,L36403,u313,m19,JESSE,I beg your pardon?
8812,L36402,u326,m19,ZEE,"""But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."""
8813,L36401,u313,m19,JESSE,"""Hmm"" what?"
8814,L36400,u326,m19,ZEE,Hmm.
8815,L36370,u326,m19,ZEE,Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
8816,L36369,u313,m19,JESSE,"I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time."
8817,L36368,u326,m19,ZEE,"Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?"
8818,L36367,u313,m19,JESSE,That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
8819,L36366,u326,m19,ZEE,I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
8820,L36364,u313,m19,JESSE,She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
8821,L36363,u326,m19,ZEE,That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
8822,L36362,u313,m19,JESSE,She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
8823,L36361,u326,m19,ZEE,I don't understand.
8824,L36360,u313,m19,JESSE,I had to see you. I'm getting married.
8825,L36359,u326,m19,ZEE,Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
8826,L36358,u313,m19,JESSE,Zee.
8827,L35987,u313,m19,JESSE,When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
8828,L35986,u326,m19,ZEE,Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
8829,L35985,u313,m19,JESSE,Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
8830,L35984,u326,m19,ZEE,Let the law --
8831,L35983,u313,m19,JESSE,Me neither.
8832,L35982,u326,m19,ZEE,"You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this."
8833,L35981,u313,m19,JESSE,Frank and me have to go away for a while.
8834,L35980,u326,m19,ZEE,"I am so sorry, Jesse."
8835,L35945,u313,m19,JESSE,I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
8836,L35944,u326,m19,ZEE,Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
8837,L35943,u313,m19,JESSE,Yep.
8838,L35942,u326,m19,ZEE,Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
8839,L35941,u313,m19,JESSE,Little ones.
8840,L35940,u326,m19,ZEE,Sparkling rocks?
8841,L35939,u313,m19,JESSE,"Ahem. ""From this doctrine..."" No, ah... ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."""
8842,L35937,u313,m19,JESSE,"Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth."
8843,L35936,u326,m19,ZEE,Where will you find such a girl?
8844,L35935,u313,m19,JESSE,Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
8845,L35934,u326,m19,ZEE,And what's this right girl like?
8846,L35933,u313,m19,JESSE,Not if I find the right girl.
8847,L35932,u326,m19,ZEE,"You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?"
8848,L35931,u313,m19,JESSE,"Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor."
8849,L35930,u326,m19,ZEE,"Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?"
8850,L35929,u313,m19,JESSE,"Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy."
8851,L35928,u326,m19,ZEE,A river pirate.
8852,L35927,u313,m19,JESSE,I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
8853,L35926,u326,m19,ZEE,You didn't want to farm?
8854,L35925,u313,m19,JESSE,I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
8855,L35905,u313,m19,JESSE,Unfair. You are completely unfair.
8856,L35904,u326,m19,ZEE,So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
8857,L35903,u313,m19,JESSE,I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
8858,L35902,u326,m19,ZEE,"Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero."
8859,L35901,u313,m19,JESSE,What?
8860,L35900,u326,m19,ZEE,I shouldn't tease a hero.
8861,L35899,u313,m19,JESSE,"What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean."
8862,L35898,u326,m19,ZEE,Teasing you is completely unfair.
8863,L35897,u313,m19,JESSE,"No! I mean, of course not. No."
8864,L35896,u326,m19,ZEE,You're sick of my company?
8865,L35895,u313,m19,JESSE,I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
8866,L35894,u326,m19,ZEE,You shouldn't be up.
8867,L35873,u313,m19,JESSE,Nuh-huh ...
8868,L35872,u326,m19,ZEE,"Jesse, is that your hand?"
8869,L35871,u313,m19,JESSE,Mmmm.
8870,L35870,u326,m19,ZEE,"Jesse, are you awake?"
8871,L35712,u313,m19,JESSE,"If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help."
8872,L35711,u326,m19,ZEE,But still died.
8873,L35697,u313,m19,JESSE,But you got big!
8874,L35696,u326,m19,ZEE,You were little Jesse James when you left.
8875,L35695,u313,m19,JESSE,Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
8876,L36508,u313,m19,JESSE,Fair enough.
8877,L36507,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time."
8878,L36506,u313,m19,JESSE,Thanks.
8879,L36505,u322,m19,PINKERTON,The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
8880,L36499,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife."
8881,L36498,u313,m19,JESSE,That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
8882,L36457,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit."
8883,L36456,u313,m19,JESSE,"Ahh, you'll miss me."
8884,L36455,u322,m19,PINKERTON,You cocky little bastard.
8885,L36454,u313,m19,JESSE,I'm not hanged yet.
8886,L36453,u322,m19,PINKERTON,That's what I would have done.
8887,L36452,u313,m19,JESSE,Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
8888,L36451,u322,m19,PINKERTON,Was it worth it?
8889,L36450,u313,m19,JESSE,I figured.
8890,L36449,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know."
8891,L36448,u313,m19,JESSE,"No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one."
8892,L36447,u322,m19,PINKERTON,I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
8893,L36446,u313,m19,JESSE,"Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me."
8894,L36445,u322,m19,PINKERTON,Damn.
8895,L36444,u313,m19,JESSE,The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
8896,L36443,u322,m19,PINKERTON,Yes?
8897,L36442,u313,m19,JESSE,"You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?"
8898,L36441,u322,m19,PINKERTON,Mmm.
8899,L36440,u313,m19,JESSE,Last February?
8900,L36439,u322,m19,PINKERTON,How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
8901,L36438,u322,m19,PINKERTON,Pity.
8902,L36437,u313,m19,JESSE,You almost ended my career before it began.
8903,L36435,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day."
8904,L36434,u313,m19,JESSE,Did you order our houses burned down?
8905,L36433,u322,m19,PINKERTON,That's the idea.
8906,L36432,u313,m19,JESSE,So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
8907,L36431,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers."
8908,L36430,u313,m19,JESSE,But I like the presidential suite.
8909,L36429,u322,m19,PINKERTON,We're moving you tomorrow.
8910,L36383,u321,m19,PASTOR,Communion.
8911,L36382,u313,m19,JESSE,Right here in church?
8912,L36381,u321,m19,PASTOR,Now let's have a drink.
8913,L36380,u321,m19,PASTOR,Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
8914,L36379,u313,m19,JESSE,Thank you.
8915,L36378,u321,m19,PASTOR,"Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth."
8916,L36377,u313,m19,JESSE,"I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your..."
8917,L36376,u321,m19,PASTOR,"The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  ""Jesse Woodson James."" Jesse James? The Jesse James?"
8918,L36375,u313,m19,JESSE,"You don't think God'll mind, do you?"
8919,L36374,u321,m19,PASTOR,This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
8920,L36339,u313,m19,JESSE,"You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy."
8921,L36338,u314,m19,JIM,"Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time..."
8922,L36337,u313,m19,JESSE,This time we'll make an exception.
8923,L36336,u314,m19,JIM,... too young for whisky...
8924,L36310,u314,m19,JIM,"It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?"
8925,L36309,u313,m19,JESSE,What about that Rock Island bastard?
8926,L36227,u313,m19,JESSE,You do that.
8927,L36226,u314,m19,JIM,Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
8928,L36225,u313,m19,JESSE,I swear.
8929,L36224,u314,m19,JIM,"You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?"
8930,L36223,u313,m19,JESSE,I think so.
8931,L36222,u314,m19,JIM,"Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?"
8932,L36221,u313,m19,JESSE,You been with a girl ever?
8933,L36220,u314,m19,JIM,"Well, not exactly."
8934,L36219,u314,m19,JIM,"Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm."
8935,L36218,u313,m19,JESSE,"Jim, you been with a girl yet?"
8936,L36217,u314,m19,JIM,I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
8937,L36216,u313,m19,JESSE,I guess so.
8938,L36215,u314,m19,JIM,"Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink."
8939,L36214,u313,m19,JESSE,"Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky."
8940,L36213,u314,m19,JIM,"You okay, Jesse?"
8941,L35968,u313,m19,JESSE,No.
8942,L35967,u314,m19,JIM,I like that.
8943,L35848,u313,m19,JESSE,And the same age Web was. No.
8944,L35847,u314,m19,JIM,I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
8945,L35846,u313,m19,JESSE,And you're too young.
8946,L36245,u314,m19,JIM,"Don't talk about it much, though."
8947,L36244,u316,m19,LYLA,Really?
8948,L36243,u314,m19,JIM,Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
8949,L36242,u316,m19,LYLA,That is so gentlemanly of you.
8950,L36241,u314,m19,JIM,Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
8951,L36240,u316,m19,LYLA,Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
8952,L36239,u314,m19,JIM,"Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?"
8953,L36238,u316,m19,LYLA,Lyla Devereux.
8954,L36237,u314,m19,JIM,"Thank you, Miss -- ?"
8955,L36236,u316,m19,LYLA,I just though you were awful cute.
8956,L36235,u314,m19,JIM,Not at all.
8957,L36234,u316,m19,LYLA,I hope I'm not being too forward.
8958,L36233,u314,m19,JIM,Really?
8959,L36232,u316,m19,LYLA,"Yes, but just so I could find out who you were."
8960,L36231,u314,m19,JIM,"Oh, you were talking to Jesse."
8961,L36230,u316,m19,LYLA,"I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name."
8962,L36229,u314,m19,JIM,"Why, yeah."
8963,L36496,u322,m19,PINKERTON,Move you fools!
8964,L36495,u320,m19,PARKER,There's only four of them...
8965,L36158,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school."
8966,L36157,u320,m19,PARKER,How can that be?
8967,L36090,u322,m19,PINKERTON,By burning down their homes?
8968,L36089,u320,m19,PARKER,They had to be dealt with!
8969,L36088,u322,m19,PINKERTON,My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
8970,L35858,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case."
8971,L35857,u320,m19,PARKER,"Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate."
8972,L35795,u320,m19,PARKER,I'm doing you folks a favor --
8973,L35794,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Well, this land is about to be condemned."
8974,L36462,u323,m19,RAINS,"Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?"
8975,L36461,u320,m19,PARKER,How did you know?
8976,L36459,u320,m19,PARKER,I remember you.
8977,L36458,u323,m19,RAINS,This is him.
8978,L36253,u320,m19,PARKER,"Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain."
8979,L36252,u323,m19,RAINS,That.
8980,L36251,u320,m19,PARKER,"What, sir?"
8981,L36250,u323,m19,RAINS,What is that?
8982,L36249,u320,m19,PARKER,Sir?
8983,L36248,u323,m19,RAINS,Parker.
8984,L36247,u323,m19,RAINS,I look forward to seeing it.
8985,L36246,u320,m19,PARKER,The final route for the railroad is complete.
8986,L36160,u320,m19,PARKER,"We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!"
8987,L36159,u323,m19,RAINS,With my money!
8988,L36087,u323,m19,RAINS,"What is going on here, man?"
8989,L36086,u320,m19,PARKER,Your men knew the risks.
8990,L36081,u320,m19,PARKER,We did.
8991,L36080,u323,m19,RAINS,THEN WHO DID?!
8992,L36079,u320,m19,PARKER,"To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks."
8993,L36078,u323,m19,RAINS,I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
8994,L36077,u320,m19,PARKER,"Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --"
8995,L36076,u323,m19,RAINS,How much did they get from the safe?
8996,L36075,u320,m19,PARKER,"They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile."
8997,L35893,u323,m19,RAINS,I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
8998,L35892,u320,m19,PARKER,I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
8999,L35891,u323,m19,RAINS,"You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity."
9000,L35890,u320,m19,PARKER,A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
9001,L35889,u323,m19,RAINS,Just perfect.
9002,L35888,u320,m19,PARKER,Yes sir.
9003,L35887,u323,m19,RAINS,Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
9004,L35886,u320,m19,PARKER,"Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident."
9005,L35885,u323,m19,RAINS,Good.
9006,L35884,u320,m19,PARKER,"Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers."
9007,L35883,u323,m19,RAINS,"Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order."
9008,L35882,u320,m19,PARKER,"I can completely understand your distress, sir."
9009,L35881,u323,m19,RAINS,NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
9010,L35880,u320,m19,PARKER,Really!
9011,L35879,u323,m19,RAINS,And it is my pleasure to be here.
9012,L35878,u320,m19,PARKER,"Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field."
9013,L36491,u322,m19,PINKERTON,Vengeance.
9014,L36490,u323,m19,RAINS,What the hell is that sound?
9015,L36267,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Why, their intense hatred of you, of course."
9016,L36266,u323,m19,RAINS,What is that?
9017,L36265,u322,m19,PINKERTON,No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
9018,L36264,u323,m19,RAINS,Can you put men at all four?
9019,L36263,u322,m19,PINKERTON,There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
9020,L36262,u323,m19,RAINS,"In English, Pinkerton."
9021,L36261,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends."
9022,L36260,u322,m19,PINKERTON,No.
9023,L36259,u323,m19,RAINS,So he's won.
9024,L36165,u322,m19,PINKERTON,It's going to be a long spring.
9025,L36164,u323,m19,RAINS,Can't you tell me anything?
9026,L36163,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?"
9027,L36162,u323,m19,RAINS,I demand action.
9028,L36161,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side."
9029,L36156,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes."
9030,L36155,u323,m19,RAINS,I can't believe this.
9031,L36154,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs."
9032,L36152,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning."
9033,L36151,u323,m19,RAINS,Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
9034,L36120,u322,m19,PINKERTON,It's going to be a long winter.
9035,L36119,u323,m19,RAINS,So you can't tell me anything?
9036,L36118,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create."
9037,L36117,u323,m19,RAINS,I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
9038,L36116,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns."
9039,L36100,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Oh, that's the best part."
9040,L36099,u323,m19,RAINS,"""The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!""  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!"
9041,L36098,u322,m19,PINKERTON,It is a nice piece of writing.
9042,L36097,u323,m19,RAINS,"""A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."""
9043,L36096,u322,m19,PINKERTON,I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
9044,L36095,u323,m19,RAINS,This is no game.
9045,L36094,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains."
9046,L36093,u323,m19,RAINS,I want them arrested and hanged!
9047,L36092,u322,m19,PINKERTON,"Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too."
9048,L36091,u323,m19,RAINS,You wouldn't have done that?
9049,L36085,u322,m19,PINKERTON,Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
9050,L36084,u323,m19,RAINS,"Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least."
9051,L37123,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Nothing.
9052,L37122,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Yes?
9053,L37121,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Patrick?
9054,L37118,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Yes, Courtney?"
9055,L37117,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Isn't that special?  Patrick?
9056,L37116,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less."
9057,L37115,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
9058,L37114,u331,m20,COURTNEY,You never noticed.
9059,L37113,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I never knew you smoked.
9060,L37112,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is..."
9061,L37111,u327,m20,BATEMAN,You and...Luis?
9062,L37110,u331,m20,COURTNEY,That's nice.
9063,L37109,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe."
9064,L37108,u331,m20,COURTNEY,What are you doing tonight?
9065,L37107,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Maybe.
9066,L37106,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
9067,L36778,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"Oh God, just get it over with."
9068,L36777,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?"
9069,L36776,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS."
9070,L36775,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!"
9071,L36773,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
9072,L36772,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Why?
9073,L36771,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Take it off.
9074,L36770,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"It's a plain end, see? So?"
9075,L36769,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
9076,L36768,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
9077,L36767,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Turn the light on.
9078,L36766,u327,m20,BATEMAN,It's a plain end. I think.
9079,L36765,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"What do you want, Courtney?"
9080,L36764,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"Pull out, goddamnit!"
9081,L36763,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I'm ignoring you.
9082,L36762,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Pull out.
9083,L36761,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Is it a what?
9084,L36760,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"No, you idiot. I said ""Is it a receptacle tip?"" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me."
9085,L36759,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him."
9086,L36758,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Luis is a despicable twit.
9087,L36755,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"Mmmm...thanks, Patrick."
9088,L36754,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish."" You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely."
9089,L36753,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Yes, dear."
9090,L36752,u331,m20,COURTNEY,This is Dorsia?
9091,L36751,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Yes.
9092,L36750,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Are we here?
9093,L36749,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
9094,L36748,u327,m20,BATEMAN,J&B. Straight.
9095,L36747,u331,m20,COURTNEY,I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
9096,L36746,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump."
9097,L36745,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"Oh God, Patrick. Shut up."
9098,L36744,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Is that Donald Trump's car?
9099,L36743,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish."
9100,L36739,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?"
9101,L36738,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Pick me up?
9102,L36737,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Eight?
9103,L36736,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Okay. Yeah. What time?
9104,L36735,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight."
9105,L36734,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"You like it there, don't you?"
9106,L36733,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Nice?
9107,L36732,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Dorsia's nice.
9108,L36731,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I'm thinking Dorsia.
9109,L36730,u331,m20,COURTNEY,I can't.
9110,L36729,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Courtney? Dinner?
9111,L36728,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go."
9112,L36727,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed."
9113,L36726,u331,m20,COURTNEY,I know. Stop it.
9114,L36725,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
9115,L36724,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Uh huh.
9116,L36723,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
9117,L36722,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Yes?
9118,L36721,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Pumpkin?
9119,L36720,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
9120,L36719,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
9121,L36718,u327,m20,BATEMAN,You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
9122,L36717,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick."
9123,L36716,u327,m20,BATEMAN,On a lot of lithium?
9124,L36715,u331,m20,COURTNEY,Stop it. I'm...
9125,L36714,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?"
9126,L36713,u331,m20,COURTNEY,"What? Oh, I'm...busy."
9127,L36712,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Listen, what are you doing tonight?"
9128,L37301,u327,m20,BATEMAN,It's not that nice.
9129,L37300,u330,m20,CHRISTIE,This is nicer than your other apartment.
9130,L37291,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here."
9131,L37290,u330,m20,CHRISTIE,My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
9132,L37289,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Really?
9133,L37288,u330,m20,CHRISTIE,"Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time."
9134,L37287,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"So, you're looking great, how have you been?"
9135,L37286,u330,m20,CHRISTIE,Alright.
9136,L37285,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Nothing like last time, promise."
9137,L37283,u330,m20,CHRISTIE,I don't think so.
9138,L37282,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise."
9139,L37281,u330,m20,CHRISTIE,I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
9140,L37056,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap."
9141,L37055,u330,m20,CHRISTIE,You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
9142,L37040,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Do you take American Express?
9143,L37039,u330,m20,CHRISTIE,I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
9144,L37038,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
9145,L37036,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Would you like to see my apartment?
9146,L37035,u330,m20,CHRISTIE,You just haven't been looking.
9147,L37034,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I haven't seen you around here.
9148,L37367,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I have to return some videotapes.
9149,L37366,u334,m20,EVELYN,But where?
9150,L37365,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I'm just leaving.
9151,L37364,u334,m20,EVELYN,Where are you going?
9152,L37363,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
9153,L37362,u334,m20,EVELYN,"Oh God, I can't believe this."
9154,L37361,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now."
9155,L37359,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
9156,L37358,u334,m20,EVELYN,"No, no, no."
9157,L37357,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me."
9158,L37356,u334,m20,EVELYN,You're inhuman.
9159,L37355,u327,m20,BATEMAN,We never really shared one.
9160,L37354,u334,m20,EVELYN,But what about the past? Our past?
9161,L37353,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Yes, I am."
9162,L37352,u334,m20,EVELYN,"You're really serious, aren't you?"
9163,L37351,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
9164,L37350,u334,m20,EVELYN,But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
9165,L37349,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
9166,L37348,u334,m20,EVELYN,"Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?"
9167,L37347,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"It's over, Evelyn. It's all over"
9168,L37346,u334,m20,EVELYN,"Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?"
9169,L37345,u327,m20,BATEMAN,We need to talk.
9170,L37344,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs."
9171,L37343,u334,m20,EVELYN,Why? What's wrong?
9172,L37342,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch."
9173,L37341,u334,m20,EVELYN,I want a firm commitment.
9174,L36683,u327,m20,BATEMAN,It's not.
9175,L36682,u334,m20,EVELYN,Your hairline looks like it's receding.
9176,L36681,u327,m20,BATEMAN,No. I'm not. Why should I ?
9177,L36680,u334,m20,EVELYN,Are you using minoxidil?
9178,L36678,u334,m20,EVELYN,Everybody has a great body now.
9179,L36677,u327,m20,BATEMAN,He has a great body
9180,L36676,u334,m20,EVELYN,"Everybody's good-looking, Patrick."
9181,L36675,u327,m20,BATEMAN,He's good-looking.
9182,L36674,u334,m20,EVELYN,Everybody's rich.
9183,L36673,u327,m20,BATEMAN,He's rich.
9184,L36672,u334,m20,EVELYN,"Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?"
9185,L36671,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Why don t you just go for Price?
9186,L36656,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Hi. Pat Bateman.
9187,L36655,u334,m20,EVELYN,"Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist."
9188,L36651,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Because I...want...to...fit...in.
9189,L36650,u334,m20,EVELYN,"Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work."
9190,L36649,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I don't want to talk about it.
9191,L36648,u334,m20,EVELYN,"Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly."
9192,L36647,u327,m20,BATEMAN,No-I can't take the time off work.
9193,L36646,u334,m20,EVELYN,We should do it.
9194,L36645,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Is your Evian spiked?
9195,L36644,u334,m20,EVELYN,"Yes, darling?"
9196,L36643,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Evelyn?
9197,L36642,u334,m20,EVELYN,Get married. Have a wedding.
9198,L36641,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Do...what.
9199,L36640,u334,m20,EVELYN,"Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it."
9200,L37092,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? ""What about fucking dinner?"""
9201,L37091,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,"Listen, what about dinner?"
9202,L37086,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy."
9203,L37085,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
9204,L37084,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
9205,L37078,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality."
9206,L37077,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,"Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman."
9207,L37076,u327,m20,BATEMAN,How did you guess?
9208,L37075,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,Because he dated her.
9209,L37074,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I know her. I knew her.
9210,L37073,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,"But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?"
9211,L36809,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Nice.
9212,L36808,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
9213,L36804,u327,m20,BATEMAN,That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
9214,L36803,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,Good coloring.
9215,L36802,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Picked them up from the printers yesterday
9216,L36555,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,What are the rules for a sweater vest?
9217,L36554,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress ."
9218,L37420,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I won't...don't worry.
9219,L37419,u339,m20,MRS. WOLFE,Don't come back.
9220,L37418,u339,m20,MRS. WOLFE,Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
9221,L37417,u327,m20,BATEMAN,But I think...I want to know what happened here.
9222,L37416,u339,m20,MRS. WOLFE,I think you should go now.
9223,L37415,u339,m20,MRS. WOLFE,There was no ad in the Times.
9224,L37414,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?"
9225,L37413,u339,m20,MRS. WOLFE,You saw the ad in the Times?
9226,L37412,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Are you sure?
9227,L37411,u339,m20,MRS. WOLFE,"No, he doesn't."
9228,L37410,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Doesn't he live here?
9229,L37409,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
9230,L37408,u339,m20,MRS. WOLFE,Can I help you?
9231,L37407,u327,m20,BATEMAN,No.
9232,L37406,u339,m20,MRS. WOLFE,Are you my two o'clock?
9233,L37470,u328,m20,CARNES,"Now, if you'll excuse me."
9234,L37469,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"No, you...didn't?"
9235,L37468,u328,m20,CARNES,Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
9236,L37467,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Why not, you stupid bastard?"
9237,L37466,u328,m20,CARNES,It's just not.
9238,L37465,u327,m20,BATEMAN,It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
9239,L37464,u328,m20,CARNES,But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
9240,L37463,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer"
9241,L37462,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer."
9242,L37461,u328,m20,CARNES,Excuse me. I really must he going.
9243,L37460,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true."
9244,L37459,u328,m20,CARNES,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must..."
9245,L37458,u328,m20,CARNES,"Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?"
9246,L37457,u327,m20,BATEMAN,What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
9247,L37456,u328,m20,CARNES,"Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer."
9248,L37455,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Carnes? Wait.
9249,L37453,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"But wait, Harold, what do you mean?"
9250,L37452,u328,m20,CARNES,"By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?"

9297,L36667,u341,m20,PRICE,Like what?
9298,L36666,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand."

9304,L36591,u341,m20,PRICE,It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!

9314,L36563,u341,m20,PRICE,"It looks that way, doesn't it?"
9315,L36562,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?

9334,L37433,u336,m20,JEAN,"Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?"
9335,L37432,u327,m20,BATEMAN,What are I doing?
9336,L37431,u336,m20,JEAN,Patrick? I can't hear you.
9337,L37430,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?"

9345,L37253,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
9346,L37252,u336,m20,JEAN,And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
9347,L37251,u336,m20,JEAN,"No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go."
9348,L37250,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?"
9349,L37249,u336,m20,JEAN,"I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?"
9350,L37248,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.

9357,L37236,u336,m20,JEAN,"Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?"
9358,L37235,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun."
9359,L37234,u336,m20,JEAN,What's that?
9360,L37233,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Forget it.
9361,L37232,u336,m20,JEAN,Who's Ted Bundy?
9362,L37231,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?"
9363,L37230,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Growing. I'm glad you said that.
9364,L37229,u336,m20,JEAN,"Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing."
9365,L37228,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?"
9366,L37227,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun."

9368,L37225,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Interesting.
9369,L37224,u336,m20,JEAN,"No, not really."
9370,L37223,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Do you have a boyfriend?
9371,L37222,u336,m20,JEAN,"Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure."
9372,L37221,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?"
9373,L37219,u327,m20,BATEMAN,No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
9374,L37218,u336,m20,JEAN,"Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower."
9375,L37217,u327,m20,BATEMAN,You can always he thinner. Look...better.
9376,L37216,u336,m20,JEAN,"You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit."

9390,L37190,u336,m20,JEAN,"Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision."
9391,L37189,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
9392,L37188,u336,m20,JEAN,Anywhere you want?
9393,L37186,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Well, isn't this a coincidence."
9394,L37185,u336,m20,JEAN,Oh no. I have no plans.
9395,L37184,u327,m20,BATEMAN,That is...if you're not doing anything.
9396,L37183,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
9397,L37182,u336,m20,JEAN,"Yes, Patrick?"

9459,L36703,u343,m20,VICTORIA,"Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?"
9460,L36702,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes."
9461,L36701,u343,m20,VICTORIA,Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
9462,L36700,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?"
9463,L36698,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
9464,L36697,u343,m20,VICTORIA,"Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best."
9465,L36696,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Well.
9466,L36695,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Hello
9467,L36694,u343,m20,VICTORIA,"Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you."
9468,L37337,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
9469,L37336,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening."
9470,L37335,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,"Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird."
9471,L37334,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing."
9472,L37333,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
9473,L37332,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
9474,L37330,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,Does he do this all the time?
9475,L37329,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
9476,L37328,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
9477,L37327,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
9478,L37326,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,"Patrick, you re a lunatic."
9479,L37325,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free."
9480,L37324,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
9481,L37323,u327,m20,BATEMAN,No.
9482,L37322,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,"Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?"
9483,L37321,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,"I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you."
9484,L37320,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Paul Owen.
9485,L37319,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,Who?
9486,L37318,u327,m20,BATEMAN,You're at Paul Owen s.
9487,L37317,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
9488,L37316,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,Why would I?
9489,L37315,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Don't tell him you're here.
9490,L37314,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
9491,L37313,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Elizabeth, it's three in the morning."
9492,L37308,u327,m20,BATEMAN,She's from...France.
9493,L37307,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,Uh huh?
9494,L37306,u327,m20,BATEMAN,She's my...cousin.
9495,L37305,u333,m20,ELIZABETH,"If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?"
9496,L37304,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"What do you mean, she was a hot number."
9497,L37400,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?"
9498,L37399,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night."
9499,L37398,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and   - you."
9500,L37397,u327,m20,BATEMAN,So who was he with?
9501,L37396,u337,m20,KIMBALL,He wasn't with Paul Owen.
9502,L37395,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Where was Marcus?
9503,L37394,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
9504,L37393,u337,m20,KIMBALL,I checked it out. It's clean.
9505,L37392,u327,m20,BATEMAN,He does? You're sure?
9506,L37391,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Yes.
9507,L37390,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Well, does Marcus have an alibi?"
9508,L37389,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Yes.
9509,L37388,u327,m20,BATEMAN,But Marcus denied it?
9510,L37387,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
9511,L37386,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Marcus?
9512,L37385,u337,m20,KIMBALL,I've questioned him.
9513,L37384,u327,m20,BATEMAN,And?
9514,L37383,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam."
9515,L37382,u327,m20,BATEMAN,But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
9516,L37381,u337,m20,KIMBALL,I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
9517,L37380,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
9518,L37379,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?"
9519,L37378,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Suit yourself, I guess."
9520,L37377,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them."
9521,L37376,u337,m20,KIMBALL,But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
9522,L37375,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Not in the mood, I guess."
9523,L37374,u337,m20,KIMBALL,No hash browns?
9524,L37280,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I'll be there.
9525,L37279,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations."
9526,L37278,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me."
9527,L37277,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Not a big music fan, eh?"
9528,L37276,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
9529,L37274,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
9530,L37273,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier."
9531,L37272,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Great, yes, I'd like that."
9532,L37271,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?"
9533,L37270,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered."
9534,L37269,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman."
9535,L37268,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's."
9536,L37267,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
9537,L37266,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Well, I could he wrong."
9538,L37265,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Let's see...  That you were with-
9539,L37264,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
9540,L37263,u337,m20,KIMBALL,That's not the information I've received.
9541,L37262,u327,m20,BATEMAN,What?
9542,L37261,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Wait. That's not what I've got.
9543,L37260,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
9544,L37259,u327,m20,BATEMAN,God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
9545,L37258,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
9546,L37257,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Not really.
9547,L37256,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?"
9548,L37255,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence."
9549,L37135,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man."
9550,L37134,u337,m20,KIMBALL,I mean they want to get caught.
9551,L37132,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?"
9552,L37131,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump."
9553,L37130,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?"
9554,L37129,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for ""formal questioning?"""
9555,L37128,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know."
9556,L37127,u337,m20,KIMBALL,So...you hang out here a lot?
9557,L37126,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Don.
9558,L37125,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
9559,L37029,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman."
9560,L37028,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Absolutely, I'm 100% with you."
9561,L37027,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all..."
9562,L37025,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Oh really? I didn't know that.
9563,L37024,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Uh, no. There's one...down here."
9564,L37023,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
9565,L37022,u327,m20,BATEMAN,You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
9566,L37021,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Eerie. Really eerie.
9567,L37020,u327,m20,BATEMAN,The earth just opens up and swallows people.
9568,L37019,u337,m20,KIMBALL,People just...disappear.
9569,L37018,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Nothing.
9570,L37017,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then..."
9571,L37016,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"That's so typical, isn't it?"
9572,L37015,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything."
9573,L37014,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?"
9574,L37013,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it."
9575,L37012,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Had his apartment been burglarized?
9576,L37011,u337,m20,KIMBALL,No.
9577,L37010,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Have you consulted a psychic?
9578,L37009,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing."
9579,L37008,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
9580,L37007,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-"
9581,L37006,u327,m20,BATEMAN,What?
9582,L37005,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?"
9583,L37004,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Oh.
9584,L37003,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so..."
9585,L37002,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Hmmm.
9586,L37001,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Actually, yes."
9587,L37000,u327,m20,BATEMAN,But...has anyone seen him in London?
9588,L36999,u337,m20,KIMBALL,His girlfriend doesn't think so.
9589,L36998,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Well, maybe he did, huh?"
9590,L36997,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London."
9591,L36996,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
9592,L36995,u337,m20,KIMBALL,So was I.
9593,L36994,u327,m20,BATEMAN,We were both seven in 1969.
9594,L36993,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
9595,L36991,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help."
9596,L36990,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Don't you know this?
9597,L36989,u337,m20,KIMBALL,And where did he go to school?
9598,L36988,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"No, he just hung out there."
9599,L36987,u337,m20,KIMBALL,He had a yacht?
9600,L36986,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
9601,L36985,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Yeah. You know...hang out.
9602,L36984,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Hang...out?
9603,L36983,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Where did Paul hang out?
9604,L36982,u327,m20,BATEMAN,No. Not really.
9605,L36981,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Do you feel that way?
9606,L36980,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
9607,L36979,u337,m20,KIMBALL,What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
9608,L36978,u327,m20,BATEMAN,He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
9609,L36977,u337,m20,KIMBALL,So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
9610,L36975,u337,m20,KIMBALL,What do you mean...Yale thing?
9611,L36974,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Yeah...Yale thing.
9612,L36973,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Yale thing?
9613,L36972,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know."
9614,L36971,u337,m20,KIMBALL,How well did you know him?
9615,L36970,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Well...
9616,L36969,u337,m20,KIMBALL,What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
9617,L36966,u327,m20,BATEMAN,No problem.
9618,L36965,u337,m20,KIMBALL,You sure?
9619,L36964,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"No, I guess it's okay."
9620,L36963,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Would you rather I not smoke?
9621,L36962,u337,m20,KIMBALL,I know. I'm sorry.
9622,L36961,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Bad habit.
9623,L36959,u337,m20,KIMBALL,You seem...nervous.
9624,L36958,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Who do you ask?
9625,L36957,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Pardon me, but are you okay?"
9626,L36956,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Thanks.
9627,L36955,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Nice. Very nice.
9628,L36954,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
9629,L36953,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Your address?
9630,L36952,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
9631,L36951,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Where did you go to school?
9632,L36950,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
9633,L36949,u337,m20,KIMBALL,How old are you?
9634,L36948,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Shoot.
9635,L36947,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?"
9636,L36946,u327,m20,BATEMAN,You sure? I can always get you a lime.
9637,L36945,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"No, really. I'm okay."
9638,L36944,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Understandable.  Lime?
9639,L36943,u337,m20,KIMBALL,I think his family wants this kept quiet.
9640,L36942,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on ""Page Six"" at least."
9641,L36941,u337,m20,KIMBALL,The disappearance of Paul Owen.
9642,L36940,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Well, what's the topic of discussion?"
9643,L36939,u327,m20,BATEMAN,It's no problem
9644,L36938,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"Oh no, I'm okay."
9645,L36937,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
9646,L36936,u337,m20,KIMBALL,KIMBALL.
9647,L36933,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"No, I'm okay."
9648,L36932,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Perrier? San Pellegrino?
9649,L36931,u337,m20,KIMBALL,No. I'm okay.
9650,L36930,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Coffee?
9651,L36929,u337,m20,KIMBALL,So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
9652,L36928,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes."
9653,L36927,u337,m20,KIMBALL,Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
9654,L36926,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?"
9655,L36925,u337,m20,KIMBALL,I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
9656,L36924,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"So, what's the topic of discussion?"
9657,L36923,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get."

9660,L36920,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
9661,L36919,u337,m20,KIMBALL,"No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?"
9662,L36918,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that."
9663,L36845,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry."
9664,L36844,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,I can't...I can't find a shelter
9665,L36843,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God."
9666,L36842,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
9667,L36841,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Shhhh...it's okay.
9668,L36840,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,"You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell."
9669,L36839,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you."
9670,L36838,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,Al.
9671,L36837,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Speak up. Come on.
9672,L36836,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,Al.
9673,L36835,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Listen, what's your name?"
9674,L36834,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,What am I gonna do?
9675,L36833,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?"
9676,L36832,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,I'm hungry.
9677,L36831,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you."
9678,L36830,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,I'm hungry
9679,L36829,u327,m20,BATEMAN,You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
9680,L36828,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,I'm not...
9681,L36827,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?"
9682,L36826,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,I'm so hungry.
9683,L36825,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Gee, uh, that's too bad."
9684,L36824,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?"
9685,L36823,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,I lost my job...
9686,L36822,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?"
9687,L36821,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,I'm so hungry.
9688,L36820,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"It's cold out, too, isn't it?"
9689,L36819,u335,m20,HOMELESS MAN,I'm so hungry.
9690,L36893,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Yes, it is."
9691,L36892,u340,m20,OWEN,Is that a raincoat?
9692,L36891,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"No, Owen."
9693,L36890,u340,m20,OWEN,Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
9694,L36889,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Yes, Owen?"
9695,L36888,u340,m20,OWEN,"Hey, Halberstam?"
9696,L36885,u340,m20,OWEN,"They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically."
9697,L36884,u327,m20,BATEMAN,You like Huey Lewis and the News?
9698,L36882,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us."
9699,L36881,u340,m20,OWEN,"No, man. I'm gonna bail."
9700,L36880,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?"
9701,L36879,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check."
9702,L36878,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Another Martini, Paul?"
9703,L36877,u340,m20,OWEN,Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
9704,L36876,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Cecelia is, well...you know"
9705,L36875,u340,m20,OWEN,"And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?"
9706,L36870,u340,m20,OWEN,"I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you."
9707,L36869,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?"
9708,L36867,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Nobody goes there anymore.
9709,L36866,u340,m20,OWEN,We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
9710,L36865,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello."
9711,L36864,u340,m20,OWEN,"Yeah, well, you're late."
9712,L36863,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here."
9713,L36793,u327,m20,BATEMAN,Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
9714,L36792,u340,m20,OWEN,And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
9715,L36791,u327,m20,BATEMAN,"Oh well, you know."
9716,L36790,u340,m20,OWEN,Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
9717,L36789,u327,m20,BATEMAN,It's...it's...all right.
9718,L36788,u340,m20,OWEN,"How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?"
9719,L36786,u327,m20,BATEMAN,I've been great. And you?
9720,L36785,u340,m20,OWEN,"Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?"
9721,L37475,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,"Some guys are just born cool, I guess."
9722,L37474,u341,m20,PRICE,"I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?"
9723,L37473,u341,m20,PRICE,I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
9724,L37472,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,"What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere."
9725,L37471,u341,m20,PRICE,How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
9726,L36561,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,"Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen."
9727,L36560,u341,m20,PRICE,You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
9728,L36559,u342,m20,VAN PATTEN,You think so?
9729,L44800,u344,m21,ALICE,Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
9730,L44799,u350,m21,LARRY,I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
9731,L44794,u344,m21,ALICE,I can paint anywhere.
9732,L44793,u350,m21,LARRY,"You don't wanna move, do you?"
9733,L44792,u344,m21,ALICE,You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
9734,L44791,u350,m21,LARRY,I'm just screwed.
9735,L44788,u350,m21,LARRY,You know what I mean.
9736,L44787,u344,m21,ALICE,"""Make"" him?"
9737,L44786,u350,m21,LARRY,Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
9738,L44785,u350,m21,LARRY,'Gonna wait outside.
9739,L44784,u344,m21,ALICE,You are a fanatic.
9740,L44783,u350,m21,LARRY,They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
9741,L44782,u344,m21,ALICE,Is it over?
9742,L45453,u344,m21,ALICE,You're just afraid to eat it.
9743,L45452,u354,m21,MILO,Right. Wait. A toast.
9744,L45451,u344,m21,ALICE,It's gonna get cold.
9745,L45450,u354,m21,MILO,...wanna savor this.
9746,L45449,u354,m21,MILO,Great.
9747,L45448,u344,m21,ALICE,Here we go.
9748,L45446,u344,m21,ALICE,"Oh, right. Hold on."
9749,L45445,u354,m21,MILO,Don't we have any chopsticks?
9750,L45444,u344,m21,ALICE,Milo?
9751,L45441,u344,m21,ALICE,I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
9752,L45440,u354,m21,MILO,...What?
9753,L45439,u344,m21,ALICE,Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
9754,L45438,u354,m21,MILO,You look beautiful.
9755,L45437,u344,m21,ALICE,Look at me! I'm gonna change.
9756,L45436,u354,m21,MILO,Great!
9757,L45425,u344,m21,ALICE,Just shut up?
9758,L45424,u354,m21,MILO,"No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --"
9759,L45422,u354,m21,MILO,I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
9760,L45421,u344,m21,ALICE,Are you gonna tell me where you went?
9761,L45350,u344,m21,ALICE,"Milo, you --"
9762,L45349,u354,m21,MILO,"I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself."
9763,L45348,u344,m21,ALICE,Milo --
9764,L45347,u354,m21,MILO,It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
9765,L45346,u344,m21,ALICE,"He has thousands of employees, Milo --"
9766,L45345,u354,m21,MILO,Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
9767,L45344,u344,m21,ALICE,What?
9768,L45343,u354,m21,MILO,Look at this.
9769,L45336,u354,m21,MILO,"Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you..."
9770,L45335,u344,m21,ALICE,Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
9771,L45235,u354,m21,MILO,...Different?
9772,L45234,u344,m21,ALICE,That was -- different.
9773,L45230,u344,m21,ALICE,Poor baby. You know that's not true.
9774,L45229,u354,m21,MILO,"If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened."
9775,L45228,u344,m21,ALICE,Guilt?
9776,L45227,u354,m21,MILO,"After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary."
9777,L45226,u344,m21,ALICE,I remember.
9778,L45225,u354,m21,MILO,The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
9779,L45224,u354,m21,MILO,Remember Lyle Barton?
9780,L45223,u344,m21,ALICE,...Why?
9781,L45222,u354,m21,MILO,It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
9782,L45221,u344,m21,ALICE,Nothing?
9783,L45220,u354,m21,MILO,Nothing.
9784,L45219,u344,m21,ALICE,"It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?"
9785,L45139,u354,m21,MILO,So you believe me?
9786,L45138,u344,m21,ALICE,...Whaddo I do?
9787,L45137,u354,m21,MILO,I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
9788,L45135,u344,m21,ALICE,Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
9789,L45134,u354,m21,MILO,They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
9790,L45133,u344,m21,ALICE,"You can't just walk in, either."
9791,L45132,u354,m21,MILO,I can't just walk away!
9792,L45131,u344,m21,ALICE,"Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --"
9793,L45130,u354,m21,MILO,It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
9794,L45129,u344,m21,ALICE,Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
9795,L45128,u354,m21,MILO,"How should I know? ""Solving a problem,"" I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there."
9796,L45127,u344,m21,ALICE,Milo. Why would he --
9797,L45126,u354,m21,MILO,You think I don't know that?
9798,L45125,u344,m21,ALICE,"""Like this?"" It's Gary you're talking about."
9799,L45124,u354,m21,MILO,Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
9800,L45123,u344,m21,ALICE,You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
9801,L45122,u354,m21,MILO,It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
9802,L45120,u354,m21,MILO,"Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus."
9803,L45119,u344,m21,ALICE,They hack into people's programs?
9804,L45118,u354,m21,MILO,"I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says ""Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?"" It's like they know what every kid's doing."
9805,L45117,u344,m21,ALICE,I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
9806,L45116,u354,m21,MILO,I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
9807,L45115,u344,m21,ALICE,Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
9808,L45076,u344,m21,ALICE,It was a hate crime.
9809,L45075,u354,m21,MILO,What're you -- what?
9810,L45074,u344,m21,ALICE,Teddy was killed last night.
9811,L45073,u354,m21,MILO,What!
9812,L45026,u354,m21,MILO,You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
9813,L45025,u344,m21,ALICE,"I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --"
9814,L45024,u344,m21,ALICE,What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
9815,L45023,u354,m21,MILO,Isn't that -- extreme?
9816,L45022,u344,m21,ALICE,"If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor."
9817,L45021,u354,m21,MILO,"I know, I know."
9818,L45020,u344,m21,ALICE,He's your boss. He's not your --
9819,L45017,u354,m21,MILO,That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
9820,L45016,u344,m21,ALICE,"What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?"
9821,L45015,u354,m21,MILO,"It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly."
9822,L45014,u354,m21,MILO,"He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, ""Did you really do this just today?"" Cause I was impressed. He said ""What're you implying?"""
9823,L45013,u344,m21,ALICE,That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
9824,L45012,u354,m21,MILO,To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
9825,L44952,u344,m21,ALICE,Milo! What about --?
9826,L44951,u354,m21,MILO,You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
9827,L44898,u344,m21,ALICE,We're not gonna let it.
9828,L44897,u354,m21,MILO,That took some fun out of --
9829,L44879,u344,m21,ALICE,Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
9830,L44878,u354,m21,MILO,When's Brian coming for the TV?
9831,L44875,u354,m21,MILO,You saved my life in alot of ways.
9832,L44874,u344,m21,ALICE,Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
9833,L44873,u354,m21,MILO,"C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --"
9834,L44872,u344,m21,ALICE,No way. You have this -- destiny.
9835,L44871,u354,m21,MILO,I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
9836,L44870,u344,m21,ALICE,Didn't you visit the campus?
9837,L44869,u354,m21,MILO,...But?
9838,L44868,u344,m21,ALICE,"I think that's great, Milo. I do."
9839,L44867,u354,m21,MILO,"If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too."
9840,L44826,u344,m21,ALICE,But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
9841,L44825,u354,m21,MILO,When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
9842,L44824,u344,m21,ALICE,Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
9843,L44823,u354,m21,MILO,"If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway."
9844,L44822,u344,m21,ALICE,It's important.
9845,L44821,u344,m21,ALICE,Then you've gotta ask him about that.
9846,L44820,u354,m21,MILO,"A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --"
9847,L44819,u344,m21,ALICE,"C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times."
9848,L44818,u354,m21,MILO,"I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff."
9849,L45267,u344,m21,ALICE,I don't think he knows how.
9850,L45266,u355,m21,PHIL,He wasn't acting?
9851,L45265,u344,m21,ALICE,"He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes."
9852,L45218,u344,m21,ALICE,Prick.
9853,L45217,u355,m21,PHIL,Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
9854,L45216,u344,m21,ALICE,Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
9855,L45215,u355,m21,PHIL,"That'll be a test, won't it?"
9856,L45214,u344,m21,ALICE,He'll tell me when he gets home.
9857,L45213,u355,m21,PHIL,"Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?"
9858,L45212,u344,m21,ALICE,No.
9859,L45211,u355,m21,PHIL,'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
9860,L45210,u354,m21,MILO,Yes sir.
9861,L45209,u345,m21,BARTON,And Outpost? You're happy there?
9862,L45208,u354,m21,MILO,'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
9863,L45207,u345,m21,BARTON,"Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area."
9864,L45206,u354,m21,MILO,I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
9865,L45205,u345,m21,BARTON,If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
9866,L45204,u354,m21,MILO,It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
9867,L45203,u345,m21,BARTON,My goodness.
9868,L45202,u354,m21,MILO,"My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley."
9869,L45201,u345,m21,BARTON,Milo?
9870,L45200,u354,m21,MILO,"I am. I am, sir."
9871,L45199,u345,m21,BARTON,What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
9872,L45198,u345,m21,BARTON,Have a seat.
9873,L45197,u354,m21,MILO,Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
9874,L45196,u345,m21,BARTON,Milo?
9875,L45194,u345,m21,BARTON,"Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment."
9876,L45193,u354,m21,MILO,Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
9877,L45192,u345,m21,BARTON,"...It's -- Milo, isn't it?"
9878,L45191,u354,m21,MILO,"Mr. Barton, do you remember me?"
9879,L44895,u345,m21,BARTON,Like I said: shot in the dark.
9880,L44894,u354,m21,MILO,It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
9881,L44893,u345,m21,BARTON,"Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do."
9882,L44892,u354,m21,MILO,Right... What's that mean again?
9883,L44891,u345,m21,BARTON,"Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant."
9884,L45563,u354,m21,MILO,You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
9885,L45562,u346,m21,BRIAN,...When did you know?
9886,L45551,u354,m21,MILO,"He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?"
9887,L45550,u346,m21,BRIAN,What?!
9888,L45525,u354,m21,MILO,Is it your dish?
9889,L45524,u346,m21,BRIAN,Is it your software?
9890,L45520,u354,m21,MILO,Gimme the coordinates?
9891,L45519,u346,m21,BRIAN,You're interfaced with our dish.
9892,L45507,u354,m21,MILO,Wanna be a part of history?
9893,L45506,u346,m21,BRIAN,What?!
9894,L45505,u354,m21,MILO,Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
9895,L45504,u346,m21,BRIAN,Okay.
9896,L45503,u354,m21,MILO,What'd they ever do for you?
9897,L45502,u346,m21,BRIAN,What?
9898,L45501,u354,m21,MILO,No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
9899,L45500,u346,m21,BRIAN,Will I get to work for Outpost?
9900,L45499,u354,m21,MILO,"Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life."
9901,L45498,u346,m21,BRIAN,"You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show."
9902,L45497,u354,m21,MILO,This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
9903,L45047,u354,m21,MILO,'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
9904,L45046,u346,m21,BRIAN,Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
9905,L45045,u354,m21,MILO,"Sure, I'll see what I can do."
9906,L45044,u346,m21,BRIAN,"'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?"
9907,L45043,u354,m21,MILO,You're living here?
9908,L45609,u347,m21,CYBER PUNDIT,You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
9909,L45608,u351,m21,LARRY KING,We tried!
9910,L45607,u347,m21,CYBER PUNDIT,Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
9911,L45606,u351,m21,LARRY KING,And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
9912,L45605,u347,m21,CYBER PUNDIT,Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
9913,L45604,u351,m21,LARRY KING,Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
9914,L45603,u347,m21,CYBER PUNDIT,There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
9915,L45602,u351,m21,LARRY KING,That'd change with a criminal indictment.
9916,L45601,u347,m21,CYBER PUNDIT,Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
9917,L45600,u351,m21,LARRY KING,Outpost doesn't own em.
9918,L45599,u347,m21,CYBER PUNDIT,"Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally."
9919,L45598,u351,m21,LARRY KING,"That's gotta kill him, right?"
9920,L44835,u348,m21,DANNY,"I think they call him the ""Houseman."" 'Cause ""guard"" sounds too weird."
9921,L44834,u354,m21,MILO,Who's that?
9922,L44830,u354,m21,MILO,"He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything."
9923,L44829,u348,m21,DANNY,We could move 'em up here.
9924,L44828,u354,m21,MILO,He's pretty tight with his family.
9925,L44827,u348,m21,DANNY,'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
9926,L44804,u354,m21,MILO,Oh hi.
9927,L44803,u348,m21,DANNY,Milo? I'm Danny.
9928,L45419,u349,m21,GARY,"I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control."
9929,L45418,u354,m21,MILO,"I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software."
9930,L45416,u354,m21,MILO,"I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more."
9931,L45415,u349,m21,GARY,I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
9932,L45414,u349,m21,GARY,You see what's hanging on the wall?
9933,L45413,u354,m21,MILO,"Gary, I --"
9934,L45409,u349,m21,GARY,"Oh, that's right. You're ""clueless."""
9935,L45408,u354,m21,MILO,I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
9936,L45407,u349,m21,GARY,You could've handwritten it.
9937,L45406,u354,m21,MILO,I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
9938,L45405,u349,m21,GARY,"""Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice...""  You left my party to send E-mail?"
9939,L45374,u349,m21,GARY,'Sorry about the late notice...
9940,L45373,u354,m21,MILO,That's great! Thanks.
9941,L45296,u349,m21,GARY,"Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet."
9942,L45295,u354,m21,MILO,"Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  ""Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world."" The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one."
9943,L45294,u349,m21,GARY,...Worse?
9944,L45293,u354,m21,MILO,No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
9945,L45292,u349,m21,GARY,"What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?"
9946,L45291,u354,m21,MILO,"...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a ""system."" ""Losers,"" who played games of chance. He could ""read"" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again."
9947,L45290,u349,m21,GARY,Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
9948,L45289,u354,m21,MILO,Sure.
9949,L45288,u349,m21,GARY,'Have a look?
9950,L45287,u354,m21,MILO,I'm okay. It's going well!
9951,L45286,u349,m21,GARY,You look a little tired.
9952,L45285,u354,m21,MILO,"Gary, hi."
9953,L45111,u349,m21,GARY,The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
9954,L45110,u354,m21,MILO,The wrong place?
9955,L45109,u349,m21,GARY,Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
9956,L45108,u349,m21,GARY,"34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way."
9957,L45107,u354,m21,MILO,"Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there..."
9958,L45104,u354,m21,MILO,It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
9959,L45103,u349,m21,GARY,You've been coming in early.
9960,L45102,u354,m21,MILO,Oh. Yeah.
9961,L45101,u349,m21,GARY,I meant did you find other stuff to --
9962,L45100,u354,m21,MILO,Talk about work? Never!
9963,L45099,u349,m21,GARY,Did you?
9964,L45098,u354,m21,MILO,"Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure."
9965,L45097,u349,m21,GARY,Had you talked to him much lately?
9966,L45096,u354,m21,MILO,Were the flags for Teddy?
9967,L45095,u349,m21,GARY,I heard what happened.
9968,L45010,u354,m21,MILO,Definitely.
9969,L45009,u349,m21,GARY,"It scales, don't you think?"
9970,L45008,u349,m21,GARY,The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
9971,L45007,u354,m21,MILO,I'm sure.
9972,L45006,u349,m21,GARY,"Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?"
9973,L45005,u354,m21,MILO,Nothing!
9974,L45004,u349,m21,GARY,What're you implying.
9975,L45003,u354,m21,MILO,You really wrote this just today?
9976,L45002,u349,m21,GARY,Right... Right.
9977,L45001,u354,m21,MILO,Well -- you sent for me.
9978,L45000,u349,m21,GARY,Milo. What's up?
9979,L44972,u349,m21,GARY,You're making me young again.
9980,L44971,u354,m21,MILO,You did this -- overnight?
9981,L44970,u349,m21,GARY,Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
9982,L44969,u354,m21,MILO,It's okay. Really.
9983,L44967,u349,m21,GARY,"Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --"
9984,L44966,u354,m21,MILO,Maybe I'm going too fast.
9985,L44965,u349,m21,GARY,How's it going?
9986,L44949,u349,m21,GARY,"Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree."
9987,L44948,u354,m21,MILO,Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
9988,L44942,u349,m21,GARY,That's what I told her. My wife.
9989,L44941,u354,m21,MILO,That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
9990,L44940,u349,m21,GARY,Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
9991,L44939,u354,m21,MILO,...Do I?
9992,L44938,u349,m21,GARY,'Think I should buy some originals?
9993,L44937,u349,m21,GARY,Okay. I'm Gary.
9994,L44936,u354,m21,MILO,No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
9995,L44866,u349,m21,GARY,"Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away."
9996,L44865,u354,m21,MILO,I do!
9997,L44864,u349,m21,GARY,"When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --"
9998,L44860,u349,m21,GARY,"You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?"
9999,L44859,u354,m21,MILO,"It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?"
10000,L44858,u349,m21,GARY,"The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges."
10001,L44857,u354,m21,MILO,Skywire.
10002,L44856,u349,m21,GARY,"Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?"
10003,L44855,u354,m21,MILO,Low enough to relay internet traffic.
10004,L44854,u349,m21,GARY,"I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up."
10005,L44851,u349,m21,GARY,"There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it."
10006,L44850,u354,m21,MILO,"You know a lot about art, I guess."
10007,L44847,u354,m21,MILO,Oh. No thanks.
10008,L44846,u349,m21,GARY,Would you like a Coke or something?
10009,L44845,u354,m21,MILO,Cool!
10010,L44808,u354,m21,MILO,You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
10011,L44807,u349,m21,GARY,Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
10012,L44806,u354,m21,MILO,...Hello?
10013,L45546,u349,m21,GARY,Just do it.
10014,L45545,u355,m21,PHIL,Gary?
10015,L45544,u349,m21,GARY,'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
10016,L45543,u355,m21,PHIL,What?
10017,L45542,u349,m21,GARY,Wait... He knows.
10018,L45541,u355,m21,PHIL,Longitude 109 --
10019,L45540,u349,m21,GARY,Let's go.
10020,L45539,u355,m21,PHIL,Ready for number three?
10021,L45529,u355,m21,PHIL,Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
10022,L45528,u349,m21,GARY,"Okay, #2."
10023,L45518,u349,m21,GARY,Just do what I'm asking!
10024,L45517,u355,m21,PHIL,"Gary, don't worry, we --"
10025,L45516,u349,m21,GARY,Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
10026,L45071,u349,m21,GARY,Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
10027,L45070,u355,m21,PHIL,"Hasn't affected his work, though."
10028,L45069,u355,m21,PHIL,There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
10029,L45068,u349,m21,GARY,What'd the girl say?
10030,L44964,u349,m21,GARY,Maybe we should all get on it.
10031,L44963,u355,m21,PHIL,'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
10032,L44962,u349,m21,GARY,This is good. Who did it?
10033,L45619,u354,m21,MILO,Cool.
10034,L45618,u350,m21,LARRY,"You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?"
10035,L45614,u354,m21,MILO,Got out of my other commitment.
10036,L45613,u350,m21,LARRY,...You wanna work -- here?
10037,L45612,u354,m21,MILO,We'll come up with the next big thing.
10038,L45611,u350,m21,LARRY,Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
10039,L45092,u354,m21,MILO,"Those really weird, short lines."
10040,L45091,u350,m21,LARRY,"Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style."
10041,L45090,u354,m21,MILO,"It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up."
10042,L45089,u350,m21,LARRY,"He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said ""The answer's not in the box, it's in the band."" Know what it means?"
10043,L45088,u354,m21,MILO,Just thought his work should go on.
10044,L45087,u350,m21,LARRY,You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
10045,L45086,u354,m21,MILO,I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
10046,L44817,u350,m21,LARRY,"I mean, it's your life."
10047,L44816,u354,m21,MILO,You do?
10048,L44815,u350,m21,LARRY,I think you should go.
10049,L44811,u350,m21,LARRY,In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
10050,L44810,u354,m21,MILO,All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
10051,L45567,u352,m21,LEN,I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
10052,L45566,u358,m21,SHROT,Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
10053,L45462,u352,m21,LEN,Where we going?
10054,L45461,u358,m21,SHROT,Come with me.
10055,L45459,u358,m21,SHROT,I'm calling Gary.
10056,L45458,u352,m21,LEN,You calling Phil and Randy?
10057,L45427,u358,m21,SHROT,"They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later."
10058,L45426,u352,m21,LEN,"Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?"
10059,L45360,u358,m21,SHROT,Let's get him in here.
10060,L45359,u352,m21,LEN,Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
10061,L45341,u358,m21,SHROT,Any irregularity in the pattern.
10062,L45340,u352,m21,LEN,What're we looking for?
10063,L45339,u358,m21,SHROT,Keep looking.
10064,L45338,u352,m21,LEN,Every entry was authorized.
10065,L45280,u358,m21,SHROT,"Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries."
10066,L45279,u352,m21,LEN,Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
10067,L45278,u358,m21,SHROT,Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
10068,L45549,u354,m21,MILO,Wait a second. He knows I know.
10069,L45548,u353,m21,LISA,Latitude 47 degrees.
10070,L45538,u354,m21,MILO,He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
10071,L45537,u353,m21,LISA,What?
10072,L45536,u354,m21,MILO,...He knows.
10073,L45527,u354,m21,MILO,Let's try #2.
10074,L45526,u353,m21,LISA,Maybe it's the satellite.
10075,L45490,u353,m21,LISA,But you said the other --
10076,L45489,u354,m21,MILO,Bring it to the other location.
10077,L45488,u353,m21,LISA,"It's three years old, it --"
10078,L45487,u354,m21,MILO,"They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?"
10079,L45486,u353,m21,LISA,Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
10080,L45485,u354,m21,MILO,Meet me at the other location.
10081,L45433,u354,m21,MILO,At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
10082,L45432,u353,m21,LISA,Please don't go.
10083,L45431,u354,m21,MILO,"She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't."
10084,L45430,u353,m21,LISA,Why?!
10085,L45429,u354,m21,MILO,"He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour."
10086,L45428,u353,m21,LISA,Does he know you know?
10087,L45384,u353,m21,LISA,You'll come up with something.
10088,L45383,u354,m21,MILO,"That's lame, isn't it?"
10089,L45382,u353,m21,LISA,You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
10090,L45381,u354,m21,MILO,Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
10091,L45380,u353,m21,LISA,Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
10092,L45370,u353,m21,LISA,Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
10093,L45369,u354,m21,MILO,Oh.
10094,L45368,u353,m21,LISA,"Yeah, that's old, in a tree."
10095,L45367,u354,m21,MILO,"Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?"
10096,L45366,u353,m21,LISA,He doesn't know about the Day Care.
10097,L45365,u354,m21,MILO,They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
10098,L45364,u353,m21,LISA,Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
10099,L45363,u354,m21,MILO,Thank God.
10100,L45362,u353,m21,LISA,"The dishes are juiced up, too."
10101,L45361,u354,m21,MILO,"Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there."
10102,L45333,u353,m21,LISA,Gary.
10103,L45332,u354,m21,MILO,"I felt guilty. 'Cause I ""owed so much"" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --"
10104,L45331,u354,m21,MILO,"""A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"""
10105,L45330,u353,m21,LISA,What'd he say?
10106,L45329,u354,m21,MILO,I told Teddy about you.
10107,L45328,u353,m21,LISA,'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
10108,L45327,u354,m21,MILO,'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
10109,L45326,u353,m21,LISA,Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
10110,L45325,u354,m21,MILO,Why were you snooping in my office?
10111,L45324,u353,m21,LISA,I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
10112,L45323,u354,m21,MILO,Why were you so careless?
10113,L45321,u353,m21,LISA,And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
10114,L45320,u354,m21,MILO,I don't know --
10115,L45319,u353,m21,LISA,You mean -- break in?
10116,L45318,u354,m21,MILO,"Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions."
10117,L45317,u353,m21,LISA,"Before they kill somebody else, too."
10118,L45316,u354,m21,MILO,Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
10119,L45315,u353,m21,LISA,"It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work."
10120,L45314,u354,m21,MILO,"You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?"
10121,L45313,u353,m21,LISA,"But they'd still get the idea, right?"
10122,L45312,u354,m21,MILO,"It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away."
10123,L45311,u353,m21,LISA,A what?
10124,L45310,u354,m21,MILO,We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
10125,L45309,u353,m21,LISA,He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
10126,L45308,u354,m21,MILO,What?
10127,L45307,u353,m21,LISA,How close are you?
10128,L45303,u354,m21,MILO,"Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  ""GE joins Outpost in new venture,"" which means NBC is out. ""Disney joins Outpost,"" ABC is out. ""Outpost and Newscorp in new deal,"" Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!"
10129,L45302,u353,m21,LISA,Time?
10130,L45301,u354,m21,MILO,"Say there's just one ""mole"" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?"
10131,L45300,u353,m21,LISA,"But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --"
10132,L45299,u354,m21,MILO,"Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  ""CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."""
10133,L45298,u353,m21,LISA,"What about ""60 Minutes."""
10134,L45297,u354,m21,MILO,"He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire."
10135,L45284,u354,m21,MILO,Certainly not at my happy home.
10136,L45283,u353,m21,LISA,We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
10137,L45282,u354,m21,MILO,Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
10138,L45281,u353,m21,LISA,"The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine."
10139,L45277,u353,m21,LISA,There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
10140,L45276,u354,m21,MILO,Do we post it on the Net?
10141,L45271,u354,m21,MILO,There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
10142,L45270,u353,m21,LISA,Who can we trust?
10143,L45269,u354,m21,MILO,"They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over."
10144,L45268,u353,m21,LISA,What about the FBI?
10145,L45262,u354,m21,MILO,"No, no. Never."
10146,L45261,u353,m21,LISA,I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
10147,L45260,u354,m21,MILO,Hmm?
10148,L45259,u353,m21,LISA,...Milo?
10149,L45256,u354,m21,MILO,"They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his ""act of revenge."""
10150,L45255,u353,m21,LISA,He's out of prison?
10151,L45254,u354,m21,MILO,They'd frame him.
10152,L45253,u353,m21,LISA,Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
10153,L45251,u353,m21,LISA,Oh yeah?
10154,L45250,u354,m21,MILO,I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
10155,L45246,u354,m21,MILO,"You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make ""sense."" I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much."
10156,L45245,u353,m21,LISA,But why would they --?
10157,L45244,u354,m21,MILO,"It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there."
10158,L45242,u353,m21,LISA,The Day Care?
10159,L45241,u354,m21,MILO,You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
10160,L45240,u353,m21,LISA,Why would you do a thing like --
10161,L45239,u354,m21,MILO,I snuck into #21.
10162,L45049,u354,m21,MILO,She saved my life.
10163,L45048,u353,m21,LISA,That's great. I -- didn't know.
10164,L45040,u353,m21,LISA,Then and now.  But not right now.
10165,L45039,u354,m21,MILO,"So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?"
10166,L45038,u353,m21,LISA,Long story. Not that interesting.
10167,L45037,u354,m21,MILO,Why's that?
10168,L45036,u353,m21,LISA,Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
10169,L45035,u354,m21,MILO,You're compulsive.
10170,L45034,u353,m21,LISA,"Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway."
10171,L45033,u354,m21,MILO,"Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?"
10172,L45032,u353,m21,LISA,Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
10173,L45031,u354,m21,MILO,"""There is no second place."" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?"
10174,L45030,u353,m21,LISA,They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
10175,L45029,u354,m21,MILO,No. Please.
10176,L45028,u353,m21,LISA,Did you wanna be alone?
10177,L44993,u353,m21,LISA,"Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --"
10178,L44992,u354,m21,MILO,Cool!
10179,L44991,u354,m21,MILO,Show me.
10180,L44990,u353,m21,LISA,Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
10181,L44989,u354,m21,MILO,What've you got there?
10182,L44987,u353,m21,LISA,"No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work."
10183,L44986,u354,m21,MILO,Did I say something?
10184,L44985,u354,m21,MILO,Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
10185,L44984,u353,m21,LISA,...Something like that. Yeah.
10186,L44983,u354,m21,MILO,Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
10187,L44982,u353,m21,LISA,We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
10188,L44981,u354,m21,MILO,...Were you?
10189,L44980,u353,m21,LISA,I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
10190,L44979,u354,m21,MILO,I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
10191,L44978,u353,m21,LISA,You're famous around here.
10192,L44977,u354,m21,MILO,You know mine.
10193,L44976,u353,m21,LISA,You know my name.
10194,L44975,u354,m21,MILO,Lisa.
10195,L45067,u354,m21,MILO,I didn't plan this.
10196,L45066,u359,m21,TEDDY,"Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one."
10197,L45065,u354,m21,MILO,What does that mean?
10198,L45064,u359,m21,TEDDY,I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
10199,L45063,u354,m21,MILO,What d'you mean?
10200,L45062,u359,m21,TEDDY,"A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?"
10201,L45061,u354,m21,MILO,"No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful."
10202,L45060,u359,m21,TEDDY,Did you tell Alice?
10203,L45059,u354,m21,MILO,I don't know.
10204,L45058,u359,m21,TEDDY,What? Come on. Is it serious?
10205,L45057,u354,m21,MILO,I met this girl.
10206,L45056,u359,m21,TEDDY,"I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?"
10207,L45055,u354,m21,MILO,"Jesus, Teddy."
10208,L45054,u359,m21,TEDDY,They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
10209,L45053,u354,m21,MILO,What?!
10210,L45052,u359,m21,TEDDY,"But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week."
10211,L44888,u354,m21,MILO,"Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff."
10212,L44887,u359,m21,TEDDY,We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
10213,L44886,u359,m21,TEDDY,"Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!"
10214,L44885,u354,m21,MILO,Wanted to say goodbye to him...
10215,L44884,u359,m21,TEDDY,Uh. Not exactly.
10216,L44883,u354,m21,MILO,Is that how Larry feels?
10217,L44882,u359,m21,TEDDY,"And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime."
10218,L44881,u354,m21,MILO,...You got my E-mail?
10219,L44929,u357,m21,REDMOND,"You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested."
10220,L44928,u354,m21,MILO,Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
10221,L44927,u357,m21,REDMOND,"#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in."
10222,L44926,u354,m21,MILO,What're they building?
10223,L44917,u357,m21,REDMOND,Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.
10224,L44916,u354,m21,MILO,"I've got a girlfriend, remember?"
10225,L44915,u357,m21,REDMOND,"Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her."
10226,L44914,u354,m21,MILO,She's a programmer?
10227,L44913,u357,m21,REDMOND,Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
10228,L44905,u357,m21,REDMOND,"Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something."
10229,L44904,u354,m21,MILO,His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
10230,L44903,u357,m21,REDMOND,So how'd you like the house?
10231,L44833,u357,m21,REDMOND,Oh we're not going to the campus.
10232,L44832,u354,m21,MILO,So -- how far are we from the campus?
10233,L45171,u355,m21,PHIL,You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
10234,L45170,u356,m21,RANDY,Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
10235,L45169,u355,m21,PHIL,Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
10236,L45167,u356,m21,RANDY,"Yeah, yeah."
10237,L45166,u355,m21,PHIL,Speaking of which...
10238,L45165,u356,m21,RANDY,Maybe he'll get back to work.
10239,L44841,u355,m21,PHIL,There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
10240,L44840,u356,m21,RANDY,Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
10241,L44839,u355,m21,PHIL,"We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale."
10242,L45484,u356,m21,RANDY,We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
10243,L45483,u358,m21,SHROT,Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
10244,L45482,u356,m21,RANDY,"Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now."
10245,L45475,u358,m21,SHROT,We're too late. Take a look.
10246,L45474,u356,m21,RANDY,Where is he?
10247,L45473,u358,m21,SHROT,Who're these guys?
10248,L45157,u356,m21,RANDY,You're not listening.
10249,L45156,u358,m21,SHROT,I could get it out of him.
10250,L45155,u356,m21,RANDY,That kid's the great white hope.
10251,L45153,u358,m21,SHROT,"Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --"
10252,L45152,u356,m21,RANDY,"There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual."
10253,L45151,u358,m21,SHROT,Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
10254,L45150,u356,m21,RANDY,What is it?
10255,L56281,u360,m22,ALOTTA,"Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man."
10256,L56280,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'"
10257,L56279,u360,m22,ALOTTA,"I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem."
10258,L56278,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
10259,L56277,u360,m22,ALOTTA,Yes.
10260,L56276,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Is it about my teeth?
10261,L56275,u360,m22,ALOTTA,Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
10262,L56274,u360,m22,ALOTTA,Kiss me.
10263,L56273,u362,m22,AUSTIN,To my health.
10264,L56272,u360,m22,ALOTTA,"Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health."
10265,L56271,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'"
10266,L56270,u360,m22,ALOTTA,That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
10267,L56269,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'"
10268,L56268,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
10269,L56267,u360,m22,ALOTTA,"How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?"
10270,L56266,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Sak-i it to me!
10271,L56265,u360,m22,ALOTTA,Care for some saki?
10272,L56264,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Or sometimes not at all.
10273,L56263,u360,m22,ALOTTA,"In Japan, men come first and women come second."
10274,L56262,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Groovy.
10275,L56261,u360,m22,ALOTTA,May I wash you?
10276,L56260,u360,m22,ALOTTA,"Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know."
10277,L56259,u362,m22,AUSTIN,I'd rather talk about Number Two.
10278,L56258,u360,m22,ALOTTA,Come in.
10279,L56257,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Behave!
10280,L56256,u360,m22,ALOTTA,"It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable."
10281,L56255,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I didn't, baby, you just told me."
10282,L56254,u360,m22,ALOTTA,"Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?"
10283,L56253,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills."
10284,L56252,u360,m22,ALOTTA,You may.
10285,L56251,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?"
10286,L56250,u360,m22,ALOTTA,"What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?"
10287,L56249,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?"
10288,L56248,u360,m22,ALOTTA,I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
10289,L56247,u362,m22,AUSTIN,You seem surprised to see me.
10290,L55905,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Smashing!
10291,L55904,u361,m22,ANDY WARHOL,"""Fifteen minutes of fame?"" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either."
10292,L55903,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man."
10293,L55902,u361,m22,ANDY WARHOL,I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
10294,L55901,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup."
10295,L55900,u361,m22,ANDY WARHOL,Hungry.
10296,L55899,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Hey, how are you?"
10297,L55898,u361,m22,ANDY WARHOL,"Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol."
10298,L56636,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,Be careful!
10299,L56635,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Yes Basil?
10300,L56634,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--"
10301,L56631,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all."
10302,L56630,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you."
10303,L56629,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Austin, I have something for you as well."
10304,L56628,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!"
10305,L56625,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you."
10306,L56624,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition."
10307,L56623,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair."
10308,L56341,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Thanks.
10309,L56340,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,Be careful.
10310,L56339,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Yes, Basil?"
10311,L56338,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?"
10312,L56337,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag."
10313,L56336,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"All right, Austin, I think you should go."
10314,L56333,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick."
10315,L56332,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!"
10316,L56331,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man."
10317,L56325,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"That's not your mother, that's a man!"
10318,L56324,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"My God, Austin, what have you done?"
10319,L56316,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development."
10320,L56315,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
10321,L56314,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it."
10322,L56313,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage."
10323,L56312,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,What?
10324,L56311,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Carnies.
10325,L56310,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,What's the other thing you're scared of?
10326,L56309,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Excuse me?
10327,L56308,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,What's the other?
10328,L56307,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war."
10329,L56306,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world."
10330,L56305,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Hello, Exposition."
10331,L56242,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Thank you.
10332,L56241,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,Be careful.
10333,L56240,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Yes?
10334,L56239,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"There's one more thing, Austin."
10335,L56238,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Oh, yes. Thank you."
10336,L56237,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
10337,L56236,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Yes?
10338,L56235,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Oh, and Austin..."
10339,L56234,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Thank you, Basil."
10340,L56233,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
10341,L56232,u362,m22,AUSTIN,She's working on another lead right now.
10342,L56231,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Where is Vanessa, by the way?"
10343,L56230,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Right away, Exposition."
10344,L56229,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately."
10345,L56036,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,Be careful.
10346,L56035,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Yes?
10347,L56034,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Oh, and Austin..."
10348,L56033,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Thank you, Exposition."
10349,L56032,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms."
10350,L55984,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Thanks.
10351,L55983,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,Be careful.
10352,L55982,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Yes?
10353,L55981,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Oh, and Austin..."
10354,L55980,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Thank you, Exposition."
10355,L55979,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you."
10356,L55973,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now."
10357,L55972,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,Vanessa's one of our top agents.
10358,L55971,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter."
10359,L55970,u362,m22,AUSTIN,You mean Mrs. Kensington?
10360,L55969,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
10361,L55968,u362,m22,AUSTIN,When do I begin?
10362,L55965,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
10363,L55964,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"We won, Austin."
10364,L55963,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?"
10365,L55962,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over."
10366,L55961,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
10367,L55960,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence."
10368,L55959,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!"
10369,L55958,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
10370,L55957,u362,m22,AUSTIN,WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
10371,L55956,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
10372,L55955,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Where am I?
10373,L55890,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Thank you.  Let's go, baby!"
10374,L55889,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,Be careful.
10375,L55888,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Yes?
10376,L55887,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Oh, and Austin..."
10377,L55886,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Thank you.
10378,L55885,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Good luck, Austin."
10379,L55884,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
10380,L55883,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London."
10381,L55882,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
10382,L55881,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world."
10383,L55880,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"We know all that, Exposition."
10384,L55879,u363,m22,BASIL EXPOSITION,"Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone."
10385,L55897,u370,m22,MICK JAGGER,Groovy!
10386,L55896,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Good on ya, man."
10387,L55895,u370,m22,MICK JAGGER,"""You can't always get what you want!"" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit."
10388,L55894,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Well, you can't always get what you want."
10389,L55893,u370,m22,MICK JAGGER,"Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?"
10390,L55892,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Hey, Mick!"
10391,L55891,u370,m22,MICK JAGGER,"Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger."
10392,L56580,u366,m22,DESTRUCTACON,Love is... love is... love is...
10393,L56579,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Why not? It's a question.
10394,L56578,u366,m22,DESTRUCTACON,That does not compute.
10395,L56577,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
10396,L56576,u366,m22,DESTRUCTACON,"Yes, I am programmed to answer any question."
10397,L56575,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin."
10398,L56574,u366,m22,DESTRUCTACON,"Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to..."
10399,L56603,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Man, you are one chilly square!"
10400,L56602,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
10401,L56601,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil."
10402,L56597,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster."
10403,L56596,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility."
10404,L56595,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed."
10405,L56594,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man."
10406,L56593,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit."
10407,L56592,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I've got you, Dr. Evil!"
10408,L56483,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism."
10409,L56482,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?"
10410,L56453,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act."
10411,L56452,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space."
10412,L56451,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless."
10413,L56450,u362,m22,AUSTIN,What's wrong with your hand?
10414,L56621,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Behave!
10415,L56620,u377,m22,VANESSA,Kiss me.
10416,L56619,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa."
10417,L56618,u377,m22,VANESSA,"I love you, Austin."
10418,L56617,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Lay it on me.
10419,L56616,u377,m22,VANESSA,I have something to tell you.
10420,L56572,u377,m22,VANESSA,I'll secure the perimeter.
10421,L56571,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor."
10422,L56570,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Austin, I'm coming with you."
10423,L56568,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Don't worry!
10424,L56567,u377,m22,VANESSA,Are you crazy?
10425,L56566,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
10426,L56562,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs."
10427,L56561,u377,m22,VANESSA,"I believe you, Austin. Let's go."
10428,L56560,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I..."
10429,L56559,u377,m22,VANESSA,Likewise.
10430,L56558,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys."
10431,L56539,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Oh, behave!"
10432,L56538,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you."
10433,L56537,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Austin, what's your point?"
10434,L56536,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--"
10435,L56535,u377,m22,VANESSA,I'll hurry back.
10436,L56534,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops."
10437,L56533,u377,m22,VANESSA,I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
10438,L56532,u362,m22,AUSTIN,We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
10439,L56531,u377,m22,VANESSA,What do we do now?
10440,L56518,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Fair enough.
10441,L56517,u377,m22,VANESSA,Shut up.
10442,L56516,u362,m22,AUSTIN,It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
10443,L56515,u377,m22,VANESSA,Yes.
10444,L56514,u362,m22,AUSTIN,That's not the way to get ahead in life.
10445,L56513,u377,m22,VANESSA,Indeed.
10446,L56512,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Not a good time to lose one's head.
10447,L56507,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Smashing idea! Give it to me.
10448,L56506,u377,m22,VANESSA,"No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge."
10449,L56505,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter."
10450,L56504,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case."
10451,L56503,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?"
10452,L56456,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Not now, Austin."
10453,L56455,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Does that make you horny?
10454,L56438,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa."
10455,L56437,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Thank God, Austin, we made it."
10456,L56405,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now."
10457,L56404,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges."
10458,L56399,u377,m22,VANESSA,"I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch."
10459,L56398,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy."
10460,L56397,u377,m22,VANESSA,You know who.
10461,L56396,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Who?
10462,L56395,u377,m22,VANESSA,Do you think she's prettier than I?
10463,L56394,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?"
10464,L56360,u377,m22,VANESSA,"I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional."
10465,L56359,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Out and about, doing odds and sods."
10466,L56358,u377,m22,VANESSA,Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
10467,L56357,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming."
10468,L56356,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang."
10469,L56355,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Hello, luv."
10470,L56354,u377,m22,VANESSA,"You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely."
10471,L56353,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me."
10472,L56352,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man."
10473,L56351,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me."
10474,L56350,u377,m22,VANESSA,Not in the Nineties.
10475,L56349,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Only sailors use condoms, man."
10476,L56348,u377,m22,VANESSA,"No, did you use a condom?"
10477,L56347,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic."
10478,L56346,u377,m22,VANESSA,I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
10479,L56345,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
10480,L56344,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry."
10481,L56343,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Of course, luv."
10482,L56342,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Austin, may I have a word with you?"
10483,L56335,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands."
10484,L56334,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Really, Austin!"
10485,L56228,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed."
10486,L56227,u377,m22,VANESSA,"It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know."
10487,L56226,u362,m22,AUSTIN,I can't. You're drunk.
10488,L56225,u377,m22,VANESSA,I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
10489,L56224,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Oh, yes you are."
10490,L56223,u377,m22,VANESSA,I am not.
10491,L56222,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"You're smashed, Vanessa."
10492,L56220,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"No, this is me in a nutshell."
10493,L56219,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell."
10494,L56218,u362,m22,AUSTIN,I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
10495,L56217,u377,m22,VANESSA,Why?
10496,L56216,u362,m22,AUSTIN,I'm sorry.
10497,L56215,u377,m22,VANESSA,I haven't had fun like that since college.
10498,L56210,u377,m22,VANESSA,Go! Just go!
10499,L56209,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
10500,L56208,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Watch out, you're on my hair!"
10501,L56207,u377,m22,VANESSA,I couldn't have another bite.
10502,L56206,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Fancy a nibble?
10503,L56198,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa."
10504,L56197,u377,m22,VANESSA,I hate having my picture taken.
10505,L56195,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone..."
10506,L56194,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped."
10507,L56193,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Well, you know... cows, and shagging."
10508,L56192,u377,m22,VANESSA,I don't get it.
10509,L56191,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'"
10510,L56190,u377,m22,VANESSA,"We can't just sit here, Austin."
10511,L56189,u362,m22,AUSTIN,He's too well-protected right now.
10512,L56188,u377,m22,VANESSA,Let's go get him!
10513,L56187,u362,m22,AUSTIN,I never forget a pussy... cat.
10514,L56186,u377,m22,VANESSA,How do you know?
10515,L56185,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat."
10516,L56184,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Let me see.
10517,L56183,u377,m22,VANESSA,A limousine has just pulled up.
10518,L56182,u362,m22,AUSTIN,We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
10519,L56181,u377,m22,VANESSA,Why?
10520,L56180,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear."
10521,L56176,u377,m22,VANESSA,Do you want to talk to him?
10522,L56175,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?"
10523,L56142,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog."
10524,L56141,u377,m22,VANESSA,Why did you leave so soon?
10525,L56126,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism."
10526,L56125,u362,m22,AUSTIN,I can't see a bloody thing.
10527,L56112,u362,m22,AUSTIN,I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
10528,L56111,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Here, use mine."
10529,L56110,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses."
10530,L56107,u362,m22,AUSTIN,I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
10531,L56106,u377,m22,VANESSA,I'm sure.
10532,L56105,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine."
10533,L56098,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
10534,L56097,u377,m22,VANESSA,"No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry."
10535,L56096,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device."
10536,L56095,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this."
10537,L56094,u362,m22,AUSTIN,You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
10538,L56029,u377,m22,VANESSA,"I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you."
10539,L56028,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing."
10540,L56027,u377,m22,VANESSA,I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
10541,L56026,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?"
10542,L56025,u377,m22,VANESSA,What?
10543,L56024,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Do I make you horny?
10544,L56023,u377,m22,VANESSA,Sure.
10545,L56022,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest."
10546,L56014,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!"
10547,L56013,u377,m22,VANESSA,We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
10548,L56012,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro."
10549,L56011,u377,m22,VANESSA,A Chigro?
10550,L56010,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
10551,L56009,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest."
10552,L56008,u362,m22,AUSTIN,My meat and two veg.
10553,L56007,u377,m22,VANESSA,I'm sorry?
10554,L56006,u362,m22,AUSTIN,My wedding tackle.
10555,L56005,u377,m22,VANESSA,Excuse me?
10556,L56004,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working."
10557,L56003,u377,m22,VANESSA,I beg your pardon?
10558,L56002,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?"
10559,L56001,u377,m22,VANESSA,"I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative..."
10560,L56000,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?"
10561,L55999,u362,m22,AUSTIN,My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
10562,L55998,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport."
10563,L55997,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby."
10564,L55978,u377,m22,VANESSA,"My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much."
10565,L55977,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?"
10566,L55976,u377,m22,VANESSA,My mother's told me all about you.
10567,L55975,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound."
10568,L55974,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967."
10569,L55996,u364,m22,CLERK,"One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers."
10570,L55995,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby."
10571,L55994,u364,m22,CLERK,"One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers."
10572,L55993,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine."
10573,L55992,u364,m22,CLERK,"One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers."
10574,L55991,u362,m22,AUSTIN,That's not mine.
10575,L55990,u364,m22,CLERK,"OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump."
10576,L55989,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Danger's my middle name.
10577,L55988,u364,m22,CLERK,"It says here, name Danger Powers."
10578,L55987,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Actually, my name's Austin Powers."
10579,L55986,u364,m22,CLERK,"Danger Powers, personal effects."
10580,L56431,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Where did you learn to shoot?
10581,L56430,u369,m22,GUARD,Noooooooooooooo!
10582,L56420,u362,m22,AUSTIN,I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
10583,L56419,u369,m22,GUARD,"No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece."
10584,L56418,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece."
10585,L56417,u369,m22,GUARD,"Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum."
10586,L56416,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Don't mind if I do.
10587,L56415,u369,m22,GUARD,"Here, have a piece of gum."
10588,L56414,u362,m22,AUSTIN,"Here, have a piece of gum."
10589,L56410,u369,m22,GUARD,"Hey, wait a minute--"
10590,L56409,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Everything seems to be in order.
10591,L56407,u362,m22,AUSTIN,Sure.
10592,L56406,u369,m22,GUARD,"Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?"
10593,L55936,u365,m22,COMMANDER GILMOUR,That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
10594,L55935,u374,m22,RADAR OPERATOR,"Commander, I have to log it..."
10595,L55932,u365,m22,COMMANDER GILMOUR,What's its current position?
10596,L55931,u374,m22,RADAR OPERATOR,Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
10597,L55930,u365,m22,COMMANDER GILMOUR,Shut up.
10598,L55929,u374,m22,RADAR OPERATOR,"In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices."
10599,L55928,u365,m22,COMMANDER GILMOUR,"Oh my God, he's back."
10600,L55927,u374,m22,RADAR OPERATOR,"It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir."
10601,L55926,u365,m22,COMMANDER GILMOUR,"What are you saying, son?"
10602,L55925,u374,m22,RADAR OPERATOR,"No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir."
10603,L55924,u365,m22,COMMANDER GILMOUR,Is it one of ours?
10604,L55923,u374,m22,RADAR OPERATOR,"Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle."
10605,L56058,u372,m22,MUSTAFA,You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
10606,L56057,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Right. Okay. Moving on.
10607,L56056,u372,m22,MUSTAFA,Ow! You shot me!
10608,L56054,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
10609,L56053,u372,m22,MUSTAFA,Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
10610,L56052,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time."
10611,L56051,u372,m22,MUSTAFA,"Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned."
10612,L56050,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,We've got a lot of work to do.
10613,L56047,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
10614,L56046,u372,m22,MUSTAFA,Ahhhhhhhhh!
10615,L56045,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Silence!
10616,L56044,u372,m22,MUSTAFA,We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
10617,L56043,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
10618,L56042,u372,m22,MUSTAFA,"But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm..."
10619,L56041,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!"
10620,L56040,u372,m22,MUSTAFA,"But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left."
10621,L56496,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,Please allow me to demonstrate.
10622,L56495,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Really? Are they ill-tempered?
10623,L56494,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,They're mutated sea bass.
10624,L56493,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Right.
10625,L56492,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,Sea bass.
10626,L56491,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?"
10627,L56490,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,"Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died."
10628,L56489,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,What is it now?
10629,L56488,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads."
10630,L56487,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,"It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape."
10631,L56486,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph."
10632,L56485,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,Dr. Evil?
10633,L56484,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
10634,L56288,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it."
10635,L56287,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,"Thank you, Herr Doctor."
10636,L56286,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Quite impressive.
10637,L56285,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,"These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!"
10638,L56284,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers."
10639,L56283,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,"Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!"
10640,L56282,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
10641,L56090,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,Yes.  Scott!
10642,L56089,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,My son?
10643,L56088,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,"Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son."
10644,L56087,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Yes.
10645,L56086,u368,m22,FRAU FARBISSINA,"Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?"
10646,L56391,u376,m22,THERAPIST,"That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood."
10647,L56390,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
10648,L56389,u376,m22,THERAPIST,"We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you."
10649,L56388,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive."
10650,L56385,u376,m22,THERAPIST,"Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step."
10651,L56384,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"No, the boy's right. I really am evil."
10652,L56364,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Evil, actually, Doctor Evil."
10653,L56363,u376,m22,THERAPIST,"That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?"
10654,L56607,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Scott, don't say that..."
10655,L56606,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
10656,L56605,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent."
10657,L56604,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!"
10658,L56545,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,Show me.
10659,L56544,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,What did you say?
10660,L56543,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,Blow me.
10661,L56542,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
10662,L56541,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,I don't want to.
10663,L56540,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?"
10664,L56501,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?"
10665,L56500,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out."
10666,L56499,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan."
10667,L56498,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
10668,L56497,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank."
10669,L56480,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
10670,L56479,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done."
10671,L56478,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
10672,L56477,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
10673,L56476,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,In due time.
10674,L56475,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
10675,L56474,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers."
10676,L56473,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,Yeah. What?
10677,L56472,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"And that's how you want to live your life, is it?"
10678,L56471,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
10679,L56470,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
10680,L56469,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'."
10681,L56468,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?"
10682,L56380,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil."
10683,L56379,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,An evil petting zoo?
10684,L56378,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something."
10685,L56377,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,An evil vet?
10686,L56374,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,Not me.
10687,L56373,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?"
10688,L56093,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
10689,L56092,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours."
10690,L56091,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,Hi.
10691,L56085,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?"
10692,L56084,u373,m22,NUMBER TWO,Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
10693,L56083,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
10694,L56082,u373,m22,NUMBER TWO,Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
10695,L56081,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!"
10696,L56080,u373,m22,NUMBER TWO,"Umm, that also has already happened."
10697,L56079,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a ""laser.""  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the ""Ozone Layer."" Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom."
10698,L56078,u373,m22,NUMBER TWO,"Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually."
10699,L56077,u367,m22,DR. EVIL,"Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce."
10700,L56076,u373,m22,NUMBER TWO,"We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved."
10701,L56179,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,"I love you, Vanessa."
10702,L56178,u377,m22,VANESSA,"I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you."
10703,L56177,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,"No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone."
10704,L56174,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
10705,L56173,u377,m22,VANESSA,"You didn't answer my question, Mum."
10706,L56172,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,"Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery."
10707,L56171,u377,m22,VANESSA,Did you ever want to?
10708,L56170,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,Of course not. I was married to your father.
10709,L56169,u377,m22,VANESSA,Did you ever...
10710,L56168,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,"Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out."
10711,L56167,u377,m22,VANESSA,I just don't see it.
10712,L56166,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,"You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter."
10713,L56165,u377,m22,VANESSA,What about his teeth?
10714,L56164,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
10715,L56163,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre."
10716,L56162,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
10717,L56161,u377,m22,VANESSA,Why?
10718,L56160,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,I'm proud of you.
10719,L56159,u377,m22,VANESSA,"Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch."
10720,L56158,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,You didn't...
10721,L56157,u377,m22,VANESSA,He's asleep.
10722,L56156,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,How's Austin?
10723,L56155,u377,m22,VANESSA,Great.
10724,L56154,u371,m22,MRS. KENSINGTON,"Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?"
10725,L56387,u376,m22,THERAPIST,"OK, Scott, no one really wants to ""kill"" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it."
10726,L56386,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me."
10727,L56383,u376,m22,THERAPIST,Scott.
10728,L56382,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"No, he's really evil."
10729,L56381,u376,m22,THERAPIST,"We don't label people here, Scott."
10730,L56376,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff."
10731,L56375,u376,m22,THERAPIST,"What do you want to do, Scott?"
10732,L56372,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,I don't wanna take over the family business.
10733,L56371,u376,m22,THERAPIST,And how do you feel about that?
10734,L56370,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business."
10735,L56369,u376,m22,THERAPIST,We don't judge here.
10736,L56368,u375,m22,SCOTT EVIL,"Well, it's kind of weird."
10737,L56367,u376,m22,THERAPIST,"So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?"
10738,L57766,u387,m23,STEED,No need. I'll call again.
10739,L57765,u378,m23,BAILEY,The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
10740,L57764,u387,m23,STEED,There are limits?
10741,L57763,u378,m23,BAILEY,As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
10742,L57762,u387,m23,STEED,You don't say. How real does it feel?
10743,L57761,u378,m23,BAILEY,Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
10744,L57760,u387,m23,STEED,Seriously?
10745,L57759,u378,m23,BAILEY,"Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --"
10746,L57758,u387,m23,STEED,"Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?"
10747,L57757,u378,m23,BAILEY,Really?
10748,L57756,u387,m23,STEED,Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
10749,L57755,u378,m23,BAILEY,"We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid."
10750,L58080,u379,m23,DR. DARLING,"Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ..."
10751,L58079,u380,m23,EMMA,Would that I could say the Same.
10752,L57889,u380,m23,EMMA,So I'm still ...
10753,L57888,u379,m23,DR. DARLING,"He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test."
10754,L57862,u379,m23,DR. DARLING,Three days.
10755,L57861,u380,m23,EMMA,How long have I been here?
10756,L57859,u379,m23,DR. DARLING,Peter ...

10775,L57839,u379,m23,DR. DARLING,I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
10776,L57715,u380,m23,EMMA,Sir August...?  What now?
10777,L57714,u386,m23,SIR AUGUST,Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
10778,L57650,u386,m23,SIR AUGUST,"There, look!"
10779,L57649,u380,m23,EMMA,Promised? Who promised?
10780,L57648,u386,m23,SIR AUGUST,"Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised."
10781,L57644,u386,m23,SIR AUGUST,You mean you don't recall??
10782,L57643,u380,m23,EMMA,Have we met?
10783,L57642,u386,m23,SIR AUGUST,You
10784,L57641,u386,m23,SIR AUGUST,"Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ..."
10785,L57640,u380,m23,EMMA,I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
10786,L57639,u386,m23,SIR AUGUST,"You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man."
10787,L57638,u380,m23,EMMA,I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
10788,L57504,u380,m23,EMMA,Really -- what happened in 1922?
10789,L57503,u385,m23,PORTER,No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
10790,L57502,u380,m23,EMMA,I have an appointment.
10791,L57501,u385,m23,PORTER,Then you can't come in.
10792,L57500,u380,m23,EMMA,As you see.
10793,L57499,u385,m23,PORTER,You are female?
10794,L57498,u380,m23,EMMA,Impossible?
10795,L57497,u385,m23,PORTER,I'm afraid that's impossible.
10796,L57496,u380,m23,EMMA,"Mr. John Steed, please."
10797,L57495,u385,m23,PORTER,"May I help you, madam ..."
10798,L58072,u389,m23,VOICE,"You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ..."
10799,L58071,u380,m23,EMMA,Then who wins?
10800,L58070,u389,m23,VOICE,"People, too."
10801,L58069,u380,m23,EMMA,Rules are made to be broken.
10802,L58068,u389,m23,VOICE,"Quite right, but we still make the rules."
10803,L58067,u380,m23,EMMA,This isn't a game.
10804,L58066,u389,m23,VOICE,"Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning."
10805,L57818,u389,m23,VOICE,We have met ...
10806,L57817,u380,m23,EMMA,Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
10807,L57816,u389,m23,VOICE,"If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass."
10808,L57815,u380,m23,EMMA,Quite a collection.
10809,L57637,u389,m23,VOICE,Eh? In here!
10810,L57636,u380,m23,EMMA,Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
10811,L58221,u380,m23,EMMA,"Thank you, Steed."
10812,L58220,u383,m23,MOTHER,"Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ..."
10813,L58217,u380,m23,EMMA,Next assignment?
10814,L58216,u383,m23,MOTHER,"About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ..."
10815,L57894,u380,m23,EMMA,So am I.
10816,L57893,u383,m23,MOTHER,"The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment."
10817,L57892,u380,m23,EMMA,To find out who killed my husband.
10818,L57891,u383,m23,MOTHER,"This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?"
10819,L57883,u383,m23,MOTHER,Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
10820,L57882,u380,m23,EMMA,Who?
10821,L57877,u383,m23,MOTHER,A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
10822,L57876,u380,m23,EMMA,The Institute ... the funding ...
10823,L57875,u383,m23,MOTHER,Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
10824,L57873,u380,m23,EMMA,To you ... ?
10825,L57872,u383,m23,MOTHER,The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
10826,L57871,u380,m23,EMMA,I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
10827,L57870,u383,m23,MOTHER,We want to help...!
10828,L57869,u380,m23,EMMA,What are you trying to do to me?
10829,L57867,u380,m23,EMMA,Watch me.
10830,L57866,u383,m23,MOTHER,"You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign."
10831,L57865,u380,m23,EMMA,I resign.
10832,L57752,u380,m23,EMMA,After the cold war ...
10833,L57751,u383,m23,MOTHER,"London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world."
10834,L57749,u380,m23,EMMA,Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
10835,L57748,u383,m23,MOTHER,Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
10836,L57736,u380,m23,EMMA,He tried to warn us ...
10837,L57735,u383,m23,MOTHER,Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
10838,L57565,u380,m23,EMMA,Ropes?
10839,L57564,u383,m23,MOTHER,Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
10840,L57553,u383,m23,MOTHER,Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
10841,L57552,u380,m23,EMMA,How curious ...
10842,L57542,u380,m23,EMMA,Let me guess -- 'Father'?
10843,L57541,u383,m23,MOTHER,My number two. Special assignments. She's --
10844,L57535,u383,m23,MOTHER,"Looks like rain, Steed..."
10845,L57534,u380,m23,EMMA,Hmmm ...
10846,L57533,u383,m23,MOTHER,"Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ..."
10847,L58142,u380,m23,EMMA,I'll never marry you.
10848,L58141,u388,m23,VALENTINE,Choices?
10849,L58140,u380,m23,EMMA,What are my choices?
10850,L58139,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel."
10851,L58138,u380,m23,EMMA,How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
10852,L58137,u388,m23,VALENTINE,The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
10853,L58136,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring."
10854,L58135,u380,m23,EMMA,Then what's stopping you?
10855,L58134,u388,m23,VALENTINE,Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
10856,L58133,u380,m23,EMMA,The result would be ...
10857,L58132,u388,m23,VALENTINE,Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
10858,L58131,u380,m23,EMMA,Such as?
10859,L58123,u388,m23,VALENTINE,Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
10860,L58122,u380,m23,EMMA,You're mad.
10861,L58121,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ..."
10862,L58118,u380,m23,EMMA,Ring?
10863,L58117,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring."
10864,L58116,u380,m23,EMMA,"Valentine, listen to me ..."
10865,L58115,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"You know, I believe she's actually jealous."
10866,L58113,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here."
10867,L58112,u380,m23,EMMA,I'm already married ...
10868,L58111,u388,m23,VALENTINE,Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
10869,L58108,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ..."
10870,L58107,u380,m23,EMMA,'Our revels now are ended.'
10871,L58106,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ..."
10872,L58105,u380,m23,EMMA,But -- why?
10873,L58104,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"Of course. I planned that, too."
10874,L58103,u380,m23,EMMA,But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
10875,L58102,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ..."
10876,L58101,u380,m23,EMMA,Too many cooks --
10877,L58100,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ..."
10878,L58099,u380,m23,EMMA,You killed my husband.
10879,L58098,u388,m23,VALENTINE,An unholy trinity ...
10880,L58097,u380,m23,EMMA,"Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ..."
10881,L58096,u388,m23,VALENTINE,A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
10882,L58093,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ..."
10883,L58092,u380,m23,EMMA,You.
10884,L57465,u380,m23,EMMA,"Thanks, Valentine ..."
10885,L57464,u388,m23,VALENTINE,Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
10886,L58219,u387,m23,STEED,Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
10887,L58218,u380,m23,EMMA,Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
10888,L58214,u380,m23,EMMA,"Pity your mother came, too ..."
10889,L58213,u387,m23,STEED,Our chaperon.
10890,L58212,u387,m23,STEED,Not quite.
10891,L58211,u380,m23,EMMA,Our little paradise -- just made for two?
10892,L58210,u387,m23,STEED,"It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel."
10893,L58209,u380,m23,EMMA,"I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed."
10894,L58208,u387,m23,STEED,As a matter of fact I have ...
10895,L58207,u380,m23,EMMA,Have you any place in mind?
10896,L58206,u387,m23,STEED,"English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ..."
10897,L58205,u380,m23,EMMA,Still a bit chilly ...
10898,L58204,u387,m23,STEED,"A fine night, Mrs. Peel ..."
10899,L58203,u380,m23,EMMA,'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
10900,L58202,u387,m23,STEED,'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
10901,L58200,u387,m23,STEED,"The plot.  Hello, we must be going ..."
10902,L58199,u380,m23,EMMA,What kept you?
10903,L58198,u387,m23,STEED,Mrs. Peel?
10904,L58038,u380,m23,EMMA,"If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --"
10905,L58037,u387,m23,STEED,"Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder."
10906,L58036,u380,m23,EMMA,But --
10907,L58035,u387,m23,STEED,No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
10908,L58034,u380,m23,EMMA,"You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect."
10909,L58033,u387,m23,STEED,"Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ..."
10910,L58032,u380,m23,EMMA,Where are you going?
10911,L58031,u387,m23,STEED,I'll be back ...
10912,L58016,u380,m23,EMMA,Have a look at this.
10913,L58015,u387,m23,STEED,Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
10914,L58008,u380,m23,EMMA,'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
10915,L58007,u387,m23,STEED,"They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel."
10916,L58006,u387,m23,STEED,Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
10917,L58005,u380,m23,EMMA,Trubshaw again? What now?
10918,L58002,u380,m23,EMMA,Shall we?
10919,L58001,u387,m23,STEED,You first.
10920,L58000,u380,m23,EMMA,"When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit."
10921,L57999,u387,m23,STEED,"Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's."
10922,L57998,u380,m23,EMMA,What is it?
10923,L57997,u387,m23,STEED,"Intoxicating. Here, have one of these."
10924,L57996,u380,m23,EMMA,It's called Black Leather.
10925,L57995,u387,m23,STEED,What's that you're wearing?
10926,L57987,u380,m23,EMMA,Have we been invited?
10927,L57986,u387,m23,STEED,There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
10928,L57981,u387,m23,STEED,You didn't tell her?
10929,L57980,u380,m23,EMMA,Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
10930,L57979,u387,m23,STEED,"We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ..."
10931,L57962,u387,m23,STEED,I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
10932,L57961,u380,m23,EMMA,Aren't you coming?
10933,L57960,u387,m23,STEED,You'll find out.
10934,L57959,u380,m23,EMMA,Why's he called 'Invisible'?
10935,L57958,u387,m23,STEED,His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
10936,L57957,u380,m23,EMMA,"I'm a wanted woman, I know ..."
10937,L57956,u387,m23,STEED,Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
10938,L57955,u380,m23,EMMA,Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
10939,L57954,u387,m23,STEED,Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
10940,L57953,u380,m23,EMMA,"... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children."
10941,L57952,u387,m23,STEED,"Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ..."
10942,L57951,u380,m23,EMMA,No idea who. No idea why ...
10943,L57950,u387,m23,STEED,"Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?"
10944,L57948,u387,m23,STEED,I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
10945,L57947,u380,m23,EMMA,You lied.
10946,L57946,u387,m23,STEED,I told Mother I took care of you.
10947,L57937,u380,m23,EMMA,As far as you trust me.
10948,L57936,u387,m23,STEED,You don't trust me?
10949,L57935,u380,m23,EMMA,"No, after you."
10950,L57934,u387,m23,STEED,After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
10951,L57933,u380,m23,EMMA,Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
10952,L57932,u387,m23,STEED,Winning isn't everything.
10953,L57931,u380,m23,EMMA,I'm playing to win.
10954,L57930,u387,m23,STEED,I thought you didn't.
10955,L57929,u380,m23,EMMA,I thought you played by the rules.
10956,L57928,u387,m23,STEED,"Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?"
10957,L57927,u380,m23,EMMA,You're playing games.
10958,L57926,u387,m23,STEED,Not for a moment.
10959,L57925,u380,m23,EMMA,But you did suspect me.
10960,L57923,u380,m23,EMMA,Is that all?
10961,L57922,u387,m23,STEED,Keeping a stiff upper lip?
10962,L57921,u380,m23,EMMA,Mmm ... what are you doing?
10963,L57915,u380,m23,EMMA,It wasn't me; you have my word.
10964,L57914,u387,m23,STEED,"I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ..."
10965,L57913,u380,m23,EMMA,And do you trust me?
10966,L57912,u387,m23,STEED,"... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust."
10967,L57911,u380,m23,EMMA,Yes ... ?
10968,L57910,u387,m23,STEED,Always.  Except ...
10969,L57909,u380,m23,EMMA,Because you always obey orders ...
10970,L57908,u387,m23,STEED,No trouble.
10971,L57907,u380,m23,EMMA,I could save you the trouble.
10972,L57904,u387,m23,STEED,Nothing personal.
10973,L57903,u380,m23,EMMA,To kill me?
10974,L57902,u387,m23,STEED,Orders.
10975,L57901,u380,m23,EMMA,You followed me.
10976,L57836,u380,m23,EMMA,It was Peter -- I saw him ...
10977,L57835,u387,m23,STEED,I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
10978,L57834,u380,m23,EMMA,Was I?
10979,L57833,u387,m23,STEED,"The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ..."
10980,L57832,u380,m23,EMMA,Where am I?
10981,L57808,u387,m23,STEED,Mrs. Peel ... ?
10982,L57807,u380,m23,EMMA,Steed ... !
10983,L57799,u387,m23,STEED,I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
10984,L57798,u380,m23,EMMA,Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
10985,L57797,u387,m23,STEED,Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
10986,L57796,u380,m23,EMMA,This must be the last straw.
10987,L57795,u387,m23,STEED,"You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?"
10988,L57794,u380,m23,EMMA,Barely.
10989,L57793,u387,m23,STEED,"What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?"
10990,L57778,u380,m23,EMMA,Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
10991,L57777,u387,m23,STEED,Do you always drive this fast?
10992,L57776,u387,m23,STEED,"Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel."
10993,L57775,u380,m23,EMMA,Is that what you think?
10994,L57774,u387,m23,STEED,"According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D."
10995,L57773,u380,m23,EMMA,Not that I know of.  Explanation?
10996,L57772,u387,m23,STEED,"... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?"
10997,L57771,u380,m23,EMMA,Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
10998,L57770,u387,m23,STEED,"... And by you, Mrs. Peel ..."
10999,L57769,u380,m23,EMMA,Three agents killed by bad weather...
11000,L57747,u387,m23,STEED,Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
11001,L57746,u380,m23,EMMA,That's what we were working on.
11002,L57745,u387,m23,STEED,But if someone miniaturized the process...
11003,L57744,u380,m23,EMMA,Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
11004,L57743,u387,m23,STEED,Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
11005,L57742,u380,m23,EMMA,"The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'..."
11006,L57741,u387,m23,STEED,Is there anything that isn't?
11007,L57740,u380,m23,EMMA,Not quite. This is my field.
11008,L57733,u387,m23,STEED,Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
11009,L57732,u380,m23,EMMA,But
11010,L57713,u380,m23,EMMA,Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
11011,L57712,u387,m23,STEED,"For you, Mrs. Peel."
11012,L57701,u380,m23,EMMA,"She had this in her mouth. There, there..."
11013,L57700,u387,m23,STEED,"Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ..."
11014,L57699,u380,m23,EMMA,Is that written in his shoe?
11015,L57698,u387,m23,STEED,"Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ..."
11016,L57697,u380,m23,EMMA,Any ideas?
11017,L57696,u387,m23,STEED,What on earth?
11018,L57694,u380,m23,EMMA,"Very good, Steed ..."
11019,L57693,u387,m23,STEED,"Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ..."
11020,L57692,u380,m23,EMMA,How on earth can you tell?
11021,L57691,u387,m23,STEED,Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
11022,L57678,u380,m23,EMMA,I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
11023,L57677,u387,m23,STEED,Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
11024,L57676,u380,m23,EMMA,You mean my other self ...
11025,L57675,u387,m23,STEED,"I must say, you look more your old self --"
11026,L57674,u380,m23,EMMA,Did you say formal? I must dress.
11027,L57673,u387,m23,STEED,An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
11028,L57672,u380,m23,EMMA,"No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this."
11029,L57671,u387,m23,STEED,Did he say who?
11030,L57670,u380,m23,EMMA,"That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised."
11031,L57669,u387,m23,STEED,"Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel."
11032,L57668,u380,m23,EMMA,"But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style."
11033,L57667,u387,m23,STEED,Frankly that's how I remember it.
11034,L57666,u380,m23,EMMA,"You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead."
11035,L57665,u387,m23,STEED,Why should they think that?
11036,L57664,u380,m23,EMMA,Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
11037,L57663,u387,m23,STEED,I might say the same.
11038,L57662,u380,m23,EMMA,I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
11039,L57661,u387,m23,STEED,I wasn't about to.
11040,L57660,u380,m23,EMMA,You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
11041,L57659,u387,m23,STEED,Strange.
11042,L57658,u380,m23,EMMA,You should be dead.  How do you feel?
11043,L57657,u387,m23,STEED,"Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?"
11044,L57632,u387,m23,STEED,Small talk.  Try the weather.
11045,L57631,u380,m23,EMMA,So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
11046,L57630,u387,m23,STEED,"All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens."
11047,L57629,u380,m23,EMMA,Any other vices?
11048,L57628,u387,m23,STEED,The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
11049,L57627,u380,m23,EMMA,"June, July ... August?"
11050,L57626,u387,m23,STEED,Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
11051,L57625,u380,m23,EMMA,An eccentric recluse?
11052,L57624,u387,m23,STEED,"According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ..."
11053,L57623,u387,m23,STEED,I meant me.
11054,L57622,u380,m23,EMMA,No thanks.
11055,L57621,u387,m23,STEED,"After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?"
11056,L57620,u380,m23,EMMA,I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
11057,L57619,u387,m23,STEED,They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
11058,L57618,u380,m23,EMMA,"Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?"
11059,L57617,u387,m23,STEED,For a man in my position --
11060,L57616,u380,m23,EMMA,Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
11061,L57615,u387,m23,STEED,As per mother's instructions.
11062,L57614,u380,m23,EMMA,Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
11063,L57612,u380,m23,EMMA,That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
11064,L57611,u387,m23,STEED,The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
11065,L57610,u380,m23,EMMA,And I suppose you're the knight.
11066,L57609,u387,m23,STEED,A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
11067,L57608,u380,m23,EMMA,But why? What's the point?
11068,L57607,u387,m23,STEED,"Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you."
11069,L57606,u380,m23,EMMA,You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
11070,L57603,u387,m23,STEED,Do you really think so?
11071,L57602,u380,m23,EMMA,"That place is so absurd, so out of date ..."
11072,L57601,u387,m23,STEED,"Thank you, Trubshaw ..."
11073,L57600,u380,m23,EMMA,You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
11074,L57599,u387,m23,STEED,Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
11075,L57598,u380,m23,EMMA,"Steed, we really must be --"
11076,L57595,u380,m23,EMMA,Or half cocked.
11077,L57594,u387,m23,STEED,"Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod."
11078,L57593,u380,m23,EMMA,I thought we were on our way.
11079,L57592,u387,m23,STEED,Yes indeed. I need protection.
11080,L57591,u380,m23,EMMA,Do you?
11081,L57589,u380,m23,EMMA,I had a feeling you would. Touche!
11082,L57588,u387,m23,STEED,Really?  I fail to see the connection.
11083,L57587,u380,m23,EMMA,My father always wanted a boy.
11084,L57548,u380,m23,EMMA,A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
11085,L57547,u387,m23,STEED,Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
11086,L57537,u380,m23,EMMA,"We're not here to talk about the weather, surely."
11087,L57536,u387,m23,STEED,... Showers followed by sunny periods.
11088,L57525,u380,m23,EMMA,Mother?
11089,L57524,u387,m23,STEED,I didn't. Mother did.
11090,L57523,u380,m23,EMMA,"And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?"
11091,L57522,u387,m23,STEED,Much better.
11092,L57521,u380,m23,EMMA,"Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel."
11093,L57520,u387,m23,STEED,"I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?"
11094,L57519,u380,m23,EMMA,And just what is the game?
11095,L57518,u387,m23,STEED,"Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing."
11096,L57517,u380,m23,EMMA,Rules are made to be broken.
11097,L57516,u387,m23,STEED,Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
11098,L57515,u380,m23,EMMA,Whereas you are.
11099,L57514,u387,m23,STEED,"Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor."
11100,L57513,u380,m23,EMMA,So what was all this -- some sort of test?
11101,L57512,u387,m23,STEED,"Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?"
11102,L57511,u380,m23,EMMA,1922. Why the kippers?
11103,L57510,u387,m23,STEED,I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
11104,L57509,u380,m23,EMMA,I had a spot of bother at the door.
11105,L57508,u387,m23,STEED,I was about to throw in the towel.
11106,L57507,u380,m23,EMMA,And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
11107,L57506,u387,m23,STEED,"Doctor Peel, I presume?"
11108,L58076,u381,m23,FATHER,And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
11109,L58075,u380,m23,EMMA,Decontamination -- ?
11110,L58074,u381,m23,FATHER,"Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete."
11111,L57731,u381,m23,FATHER,It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
11112,L57730,u380,m23,EMMA,You don't believe him?
11113,L57726,u381,m23,FATHER,Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
11114,L57725,u380,m23,EMMA,Where's Mother?
11115,L57563,u380,m23,EMMA,You're saying I have no choice.
11116,L57562,u381,m23,FATHER,"Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect."
11117,L57555,u380,m23,EMMA,I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
11118,L57554,u381,m23,FATHER,Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
11119,L58054,u380,m23,EMMA,I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
11120,L58053,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,"You're not venturing alone, surely."
11121,L58052,u380,m23,EMMA,I shall need a small plane.
11122,L58051,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,"Very good, Mrs. Peel ..."
11123,L58050,u380,m23,EMMA,Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
11124,L58049,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,Privately owned by ...
11125,L58048,u380,m23,EMMA,... and now?
11126,L58047,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
11127,L57989,u380,m23,EMMA,"Well, I can't possibly go like this."
11128,L57988,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,"Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ..."
11129,L57985,u380,m23,EMMA,I fail to see --
11130,L57984,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
11131,L57983,u380,m23,EMMA,Getting to what?
11132,L57982,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,I was getting to it.
11133,L57978,u380,m23,EMMA,Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
11134,L57977,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,Makes two of us.
11135,L57976,u380,m23,EMMA,Who's now vanished.
11136,L57975,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
11137,L57974,u380,m23,EMMA,Surveillance? By whom?
11138,L57973,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,"Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?"
11139,L57972,u380,m23,EMMA,I know all this.
11140,L57971,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,"Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ..."
11141,L57970,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,Half-brother to be precise.
11142,L57969,u380,m23,EMMA,Peter's brother?  But --
11143,L57968,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,"Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel."
11144,L57966,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,"Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?"
11145,L57965,u380,m23,EMMA,I see.
11146,L57964,u382,m23,INVISIBLE JONES,"Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal."
11147,L58129,u387,m23,STEED,"Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ..."
11148,L58128,u381,m23,FATHER,Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
11149,L58127,u387,m23,STEED,It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
11150,L58126,u381,m23,FATHER,You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
11151,L58125,u387,m23,STEED,How did you guess?
11152,L58124,u381,m23,FATHER,Steed
11153,L58011,u387,m23,STEED,"Dead, I'm afraid."
11154,L58010,u381,m23,FATHER,We want Mrs. Peel.
11155,L58009,u387,m23,STEED,"Oh, hello ..."
11156,L57729,u381,m23,FATHER,So you say ...
11157,L57728,u387,m23,STEED,We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
11158,L57551,u381,m23,FATHER,Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
11159,L57550,u387,m23,STEED,Global warming?
11160,L57549,u381,m23,FATHER,A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
11161,L58064,u383,m23,MOTHER,"I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel."
11162,L58063,u387,m23,STEED,In your operation.
11163,L58062,u383,m23,MOTHER,Where?
11164,L58061,u387,m23,STEED,"I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole."
11165,L58060,u383,m23,MOTHER,"You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I."
11166,L58059,u387,m23,STEED,I was hoping you could tell me.
11167,L57898,u383,m23,MOTHER,Mother and Father know best.
11168,L57897,u387,m23,STEED,Guilty until proven innocent?
11169,L57896,u383,m23,MOTHER,Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
11170,L57885,u383,m23,MOTHER,"Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ..."
11171,L57884,u387,m23,STEED,You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
11172,L57838,u387,m23,STEED,"No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all."
11173,L57837,u383,m23,MOTHER,This man -- did you see him?
11174,L57739,u387,m23,STEED,Impossible.
11175,L57738,u383,m23,MOTHER,Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
11176,L57737,u387,m23,STEED,We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
11177,L57583,u383,m23,MOTHER,You.
11178,L57582,u387,m23,STEED,Anyone particular in mind?
11179,L57581,u383,m23,MOTHER,"Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination."
11180,L57578,u387,m23,STEED,"How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?"
11181,L57577,u383,m23,MOTHER,Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
11182,L57573,u383,m23,MOTHER,She may try to kill you.
11183,L57572,u387,m23,STEED,Why?
11184,L57571,u383,m23,MOTHER,"Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out."
11185,L57570,u387,m23,STEED,Insane ... ?
11186,L57569,u383,m23,MOTHER,Possibly. Split personality ...
11187,L57568,u387,m23,STEED,Amnesia?
11188,L57567,u383,m23,MOTHER,She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
11189,L57566,u387,m23,STEED,Think she really killed those agents?
11190,L57557,u387,m23,STEED,"Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --"
11191,L57556,u383,m23,MOTHER,Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
11192,L57488,u383,m23,MOTHER,Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
11193,L57487,u387,m23,STEED,"You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely."
11194,L57486,u383,m23,MOTHER,Weather's turning nasty.
11195,L57483,u383,m23,MOTHER,Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
11196,L57482,u387,m23,STEED,Mother. I thought you were burglars.
11197,L57802,u384,m23,OLD LADY,This way ...
11198,L57801,u387,m23,STEED,Wonderland Weather Ltd.
11199,L57792,u387,m23,STEED,You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
11200,L57791,u384,m23,OLD LADY,Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
11201,L57790,u387,m23,STEED,"Both, actually."
11202,L57789,u384,m23,OLD LADY,You with Mother or Father?
11203,L57788,u387,m23,STEED,She was ...
11204,L57787,u384,m23,OLD LADY,I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
11205,L57786,u387,m23,STEED,I feel sure of it.
11206,L57785,u384,m23,OLD LADY,Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
11207,L57782,u387,m23,STEED,"I think so, thank you so much ..."
11208,L57781,u384,m23,OLD LADY,"Are you alright, young man?"
11209,L57722,u389,m23,VOICE,Stay by the window. By the window.
11210,L57721,u386,m23,SIR AUGUST,"Let it be rain, please let it be --"
11211,L57720,u389,m23,VOICE,Walk over to the window ...
11212,L57719,u386,m23,SIR AUGUST,"No, please! I beg you ..."
11213,L57718,u389,m23,VOICE,Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
11214,L57717,u386,m23,SIR AUGUST,Mrs. Peel -- ?
11215,L58194,u388,m23,VALENTINE,Ugh ...
11216,L58193,u387,m23,STEED,I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
11217,L58191,u388,m23,VALENTINE,"Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --"
11218,L58190,u387,m23,STEED,"You are, and it's behind you."
11219,L58189,u388,m23,VALENTINE,Aren't you forgetting about something?
11220,L58182,u387,m23,STEED,Did I? My mistake.
11221,L58181,u388,m23,VALENTINE,You said ... one shot.
11222,L58180,u387,m23,STEED,I do.
11223,L58179,u388,m23,VALENTINE,If you say so.
11224,L58178,u387,m23,STEED,Rules are made to be broken.
11225,L58177,u388,m23,VALENTINE,That's not playing by the rules.
11226,L58176,u387,m23,STEED,One shot -- for emergencies.
11227,L58175,u388,m23,VALENTINE,You wish.
11228,L58174,u387,m23,STEED,Bang-bang ... you're dead.
11229,L58173,u388,m23,VALENTINE,But did they teach you this?
11230,L58172,u387,m23,STEED,I was at Harrow ...
11231,L58171,u388,m23,VALENTINE,You're better than I expected.
11232,L58168,u387,m23,STEED,Perish the thought.
11233,L58167,u388,m23,VALENTINE,The last one you'll ever see.
11234,L58166,u387,m23,STEED,Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
11235,L58165,u388,m23,VALENTINE,John Steed.
11236,L59527,u390,m24,BOBBIE,Check out the other guy's buns.
11237,L59526,u404,m24,PHOEBE,Look at that guy. What a hunk.
11238,L59172,u390,m24,BOBBIE,"Deb, I want to throw you a shower."
11239,L59171,u404,m24,PHOEBE,I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
11240,L59167,u404,m24,PHOEBE,Really -- you went with him for two years.
11241,L59166,u390,m24,BOBBIE,Does Cole know about this?
11242,L59162,u404,m24,PHOEBE,...Really?
11243,L59161,u390,m24,BOBBIE,Debbie's marrying Rick.
11244,L59160,u404,m24,PHOEBE,What's happening?
11245,L59865,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
11246,L59864,u390,m24,BOBBIE,"Deb, we're pretending to be hookers."
11247,L59681,u393,m24,DEBBIE,I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
11248,L59680,u390,m24,BOBBIE,That's what we're going to find out...
11249,L59415,u390,m24,BOBBIE,Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
11250,L59414,u393,m24,DEBBIE,You're kidding.
11251,L59413,u390,m24,BOBBIE,I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
11252,L59412,u393,m24,DEBBIE,What do you mean?
11253,L59411,u390,m24,BOBBIE,"They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies."
11254,L59410,u393,m24,DEBBIE,What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
11255,L59170,u393,m24,DEBBIE,No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
11256,L59169,u390,m24,BOBBIE,He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
11257,L59168,u393,m24,DEBBIE,He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
11258,L59159,u390,m24,BOBBIE,O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
11259,L59158,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Bobbie, what are you talking about?"
11260,L59157,u390,m24,BOBBIE,Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
11261,L59444,u391,m24,CHULO,Women!
11262,L59443,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes."
11263,L59423,u391,m24,CHULO,Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
11264,L59422,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"Chulo, one thing at a time."
11265,L59421,u391,m24,CHULO,"Where's the women, man? We gotta have women."
11266,L59146,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
11267,L59145,u391,m24,CHULO,"Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads."
11268,L59134,u391,m24,CHULO,You're kidding.
11269,L59133,u403,m24,O'NEILL,What?
11270,L59097,u391,m24,CHULO,Yeah. What is it?
11271,L59096,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Rick's got an important announcement to make.
11272,L59095,u391,m24,CHULO,I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
11273,L59138,u391,m24,CHULO,"Hey, man, congratulations!"
11274,L59137,u406,m24,RICK,"Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro."
11275,L59132,u406,m24,RICK,Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
11276,L59131,u391,m24,CHULO,"Man, you're losing your audience."
11277,L59099,u391,m24,CHULO,"Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France."
11278,L59098,u406,m24,RICK,I've decided not to run for President.
11279,L59093,u391,m24,CHULO,"Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?"
11280,L59092,u406,m24,RICK,We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
11281,L59091,u391,m24,CHULO,"Hey, you guys, what's going on?"
11282,L59432,u391,m24,CHULO,I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
11283,L59431,u407,m24,RYKO,Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
11284,L59377,u391,m24,CHULO,When do the girls get to the party?
11285,L59376,u407,m24,RYKO,All right!
11286,L59325,u391,m24,CHULO,What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
11287,L59324,u407,m24,RYKO,I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
11288,L59323,u391,m24,CHULO,"Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks."
11289,L59322,u407,m24,RYKO,You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
11290,L59927,u406,m24,RICK,Fan out and look for them.
11291,L59926,u392,m24,COLE,"He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: ""24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!"" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters."
11292,L59923,u392,m24,COLE,She's mine!
11293,L59922,u406,m24,RICK,"Cole, what the hell are you doing?"
11294,L59628,u392,m24,COLE,You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
11295,L59627,u406,m24,RICK,"Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?"
11296,L59626,u392,m24,COLE,Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
11297,L59503,u392,m24,COLE,Shit!
11298,L59502,u406,m24,RICK,Maybe it had something to do.
11299,L59501,u392,m24,COLE,"Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!"
11300,L59499,u406,m24,RICK,So does Debbie.
11301,L59498,u392,m24,COLE,Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
11302,L59496,u406,m24,RICK,"Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?"
11303,L59495,u392,m24,COLE,I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
11304,L59494,u406,m24,RICK,The car for Debbie?
11305,L59493,u392,m24,COLE,I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
11306,L59492,u406,m24,RICK,I'm very happy for you two.
11307,L59491,u392,m24,COLE,I love that car.
11308,L59490,u406,m24,RICK,The best.
11309,L59489,u392,m24,COLE,Great car.
11310,L59485,u392,m24,COLE,See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
11311,L59484,u406,m24,RICK,"Ooh, be still, my heart."
11312,L59483,u392,m24,COLE,I'm ready to make you another deal.
11313,L59482,u406,m24,RICK,"Oh, come on, just a little."
11314,L59481,u392,m24,COLE,I don't want any trouble.
11315,L59480,u406,m24,RICK,"Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service."
11316,L59479,u392,m24,COLE,"Rick, I want to talk to you."
11317,L59302,u406,m24,RICK,Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
11318,L59301,u392,m24,COLE,"He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would."
11319,L59300,u406,m24,RICK,"Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away."
11320,L59296,u406,m24,RICK,What is this person's story here?
11321,L59295,u392,m24,COLE,Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
11322,L59294,u406,m24,RICK,I'm marrying Debbie.
11323,L59293,u392,m24,COLE,"Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart..."
11324,L59292,u406,m24,RICK,Not interested.
11325,L59291,u392,m24,COLE,Seventy-five hundred.
11326,L59290,u406,m24,RICK,No.
11327,L59289,u392,m24,COLE,Five thousand dollars.
11328,L59288,u406,m24,RICK,What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
11329,L59287,u392,m24,COLE,You dump her and I'll give you cash.
11330,L59286,u406,m24,RICK,Cole...
11331,L59285,u392,m24,COLE,I want Debbie.
11332,L59284,u406,m24,RICK,Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
11333,L59260,u406,m24,RICK,Bond... James Bond.
11334,L59259,u392,m24,COLE,And...
11335,L59613,u392,m24,COLE,Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
11336,L59612,u400,m24,MR. T,Fine. How's everything going?
11337,L59611,u392,m24,COLE,Yes I did.
11338,L59610,u400,m24,MR. T,"Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?"
11339,L59609,u392,m24,COLE,Mr. Thomerson.
11340,L59608,u400,m24,MR. T,Hello?
11341,L59821,u392,m24,COLE,"Yes, sir."
11342,L59820,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes."
11343,L59819,u392,m24,COLE,1002.
11344,L59818,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
11345,L59817,u392,m24,COLE,The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
11346,L59816,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?"
11347,L59619,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage."
11348,L59618,u392,m24,COLE,"Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir."
11349,L59617,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"Well, tell the asshole to shut up."
11350,L59616,u392,m24,COLE,Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
11351,L59615,u392,m24,COLE,"What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you."
11352,L59614,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?"
11353,L59276,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,Keep me informed.
11354,L59275,u392,m24,COLE,"Thanks for the advise, sir."
11355,L59274,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action."
11356,L59273,u392,m24,COLE,But how can I do that?
11357,L59272,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
11358,L59271,u392,m24,COLE,I've tried to change her mind.
11359,L59270,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"Cole, I don't want you to give up on her."
11360,L59269,u392,m24,COLE,"Yes, sir, I am."
11361,L59268,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
11362,L59267,u392,m24,COLE,"Thank you, sir."
11363,L59266,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,Nice shot.
11364,L59262,u392,m24,COLE,Sure have...
11365,L59261,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"So, Cole, you been practicing your game?"
11366,L59257,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
11367,L59256,u392,m24,COLE,"Hi, everybody. Am I late?"
11368,L59213,u392,m24,COLE,"I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy."
11369,L59212,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"I'm going now, Cole."
11370,L59211,u392,m24,COLE,"That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me."
11371,L59210,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Cole, I'm sorry, I..."
11372,L59209,u392,m24,COLE,"You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy."
11373,L59208,u393,m24,DEBBIE,I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
11374,L59207,u392,m24,COLE,You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
11375,L59206,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Cole, I'm marrying Rick."
11376,L59205,u392,m24,COLE,"You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough..."
11377,L59204,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you..."
11378,L59203,u392,m24,COLE,"It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas."
11379,L59202,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"No, Cole, I..."
11380,L59201,u392,m24,COLE,"Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?"
11381,L59200,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Cole, we've got to talk."
11382,L59198,u392,m24,COLE,"Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse."
11383,L59197,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Cole?
11384,L59935,u393,m24,DEBBIE,You're so romantic...
11385,L59934,u406,m24,RICK,This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
11386,L59933,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Yeah.
11387,L59932,u406,m24,RICK,Are you okay?
11388,L59907,u406,m24,RICK,You're on.
11389,L59906,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Let's get naked.
11390,L59905,u406,m24,RICK,"Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?"
11391,L59904,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Yes...
11392,L59903,u406,m24,RICK,See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
11393,L59898,u406,m24,RICK,"You don't believe me? Okay, fine."
11394,L59897,u393,m24,DEBBIE,I don't believe you.
11395,L59896,u406,m24,RICK,I am committed. I love you.
11396,L59895,u393,m24,DEBBIE,And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
11397,L59894,u406,m24,RICK,I don't want that. I want to be with you.
11398,L59893,u393,m24,DEBBIE,The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
11399,L59892,u406,m24,RICK,"Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly."
11400,L59891,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Let go of me!
11401,L59890,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Rick, you're lying!"
11402,L59889,u406,m24,RICK,"C'mon, I knew it was you."
11403,L59888,u393,m24,DEBBIE,I can't trust you!
11404,L59885,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Why don't you get undressed.
11405,L59884,u406,m24,RICK,How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
11406,L59883,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around."
11407,L59373,u393,m24,DEBBIE,I love you.
11408,L59372,u406,m24,RICK,"Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap."
11409,L59371,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
11410,L59370,u406,m24,RICK,"Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her."
11411,L59369,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Your mother's not dead.
11412,L59368,u406,m24,RICK,"Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave."
11413,L59367,u393,m24,DEBBIE,You're really pissing me off.
11414,L59366,u406,m24,RICK,Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
11415,L59365,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Remember, you promised... no screwing around."
11416,L59364,u406,m24,RICK,"Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady."
11417,L59363,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Can't I just go with you guys?
11418,L59362,u406,m24,RICK,"This is it, lady. Last stop."
11419,L59355,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Gonna get married...
11420,L59354,u406,m24,RICK,Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
11421,L59353,u393,m24,DEBBIE,You better not have too much joy.
11422,L59352,u406,m24,RICK,Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
11423,L59320,u406,m24,RICK,"Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland."
11424,L59319,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Um... that's very relaxing.
11425,L59318,u406,m24,RICK,Good...
11426,L59317,u393,m24,DEBBIE,That feels so great.
11427,L59316,u406,m24,RICK,C'mere.
11428,L59315,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
11429,L59314,u406,m24,RICK,"I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right."
11430,L59313,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party..."
11431,L59312,u406,m24,RICK,About what?
11432,L59311,u393,m24,DEBBIE,I don't know... I just feel scared.
11433,L59310,u406,m24,RICK,What's the matter?
11434,L59309,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
11435,L59308,u406,m24,RICK,Oh... I got something for that.
11436,L59307,u393,m24,DEBBIE,I can't sleep.
11437,L59306,u406,m24,RICK,Huh? Wha...
11438,L59192,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy."
11439,L59191,u406,m24,RICK,"Oh, those. Why do you ask?"
11440,L59190,u393,m24,DEBBIE,I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
11441,L59189,u406,m24,RICK,"No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home."
11442,L59188,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Are you going to have women at your party?
11443,L59187,u406,m24,RICK,"Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however."
11444,L59186,u393,m24,DEBBIE,It looks awful.
11445,L59185,u406,m24,RICK,"Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?"
11446,L59184,u393,m24,DEBBIE,You're going to have a bachelor party?
11447,L59183,u406,m24,RICK,Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
11448,L59182,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
11449,L59181,u406,m24,RICK,Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
11450,L59180,u393,m24,DEBBIE,I think your dinner's burning.
11451,L59179,u406,m24,RICK,"It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished."
11452,L59178,u393,m24,DEBBIE,What are we having?
11453,L59177,u406,m24,RICK,But a fabulous cook.
11454,L59176,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"God, you're a slob."
11455,L59869,u396,m24,ILENE,I know what I'm doing... Go!
11456,L59868,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Ilene, are you crazy?"
11457,L59867,u396,m24,ILENE,"Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!"
11458,L59866,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Let's go.
11459,L59522,u396,m24,ILENE,"Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men."
11460,L59521,u393,m24,DEBBIE,That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
11461,L59520,u396,m24,ILENE,"Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party."
11462,L59519,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Are you sure this is a good idea?
11463,L59251,u396,m24,ILENE,"Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs."
11464,L59250,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Ilene, Rick promised..."
11465,L59249,u396,m24,ILENE,"Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?"
11466,L59248,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick."
11467,L59247,u396,m24,ILENE,"If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party."
11468,L59872,u393,m24,DEBBIE,I hope those guys are all right.
11469,L59871,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,I hope Ilene's all right.
11470,L59767,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Quiet, Mother."
11471,L59766,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
11472,L59679,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Ilene, we don't really know that."
11473,L59678,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,A strange wang right in my palm.
11474,L59264,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,You know your father enjoys his company.
11475,L59263,u393,m24,DEBBIE,Why is Cole here?
11476,L59246,u393,m24,DEBBIE,"Great, Mom."
11477,L59245,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
11478,L59815,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"Any time, Al."
11479,L59814,u394,m24,EXECUTIVE,"Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it."
11480,L59673,u394,m24,EXECUTIVE,I think I screwed that one once.
11481,L59672,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,Great bathing suit.
11482,L59558,u394,m24,EXECUTIVE,Well... hope she'll be very happy.
11483,L59557,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,A real turd.
11484,L59556,u394,m24,EXECUTIVE,Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
11485,L59554,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am."
11486,L59553,u394,m24,EXECUTIVE,"Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant."
11487,L59518,u395,m24,GARY,That's more like it.
11488,L59517,u397,m24,JUMBO,Give him the works.
11489,L59516,u397,m24,JUMBO,Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
11490,L59515,u395,m24,GARY,This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
11491,L59514,u397,m24,JUMBO,Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
11492,L59513,u395,m24,GARY,Why?
11493,L59512,u397,m24,JUMBO,"I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?"
11494,L59511,u395,m24,GARY,What are you...
11495,L59510,u397,m24,JUMBO,"That's it, prick lips."
11496,L59509,u395,m24,GARY,Screw you!
11497,L59508,u397,m24,JUMBO,"They left an hour ago, pink nuts."
11498,L59507,u395,m24,GARY,Your whores never showed up.
11499,L59506,u397,m24,JUMBO,"What are you talking about, asshole?"
11500,L59505,u395,m24,GARY,"Jumbo, where the hell are the women?"
11501,L59386,u395,m24,GARY,Okay. Nice to meet you both.
11502,L59385,u397,m24,JUMBO,They'll be up there in a half hour.
11503,L59384,u395,m24,GARY,"Park View Hotel, Room 1002."
11504,L59380,u397,m24,JUMBO,Let's see your bread.
11505,L59379,u395,m24,GARY,"So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop."
11506,L59707,u406,m24,RICK,This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
11507,L59706,u395,m24,GARY,"Rick, I really think I'm in love."
11508,L59705,u406,m24,RICK,"Gary, how we doing, big stallion?"
11509,L59533,u406,m24,RICK,I didn't know you were into that.
11510,L59532,u395,m24,GARY,Yes.
11511,L59531,u406,m24,RICK,Hookers beat you up?
11512,L59476,u395,m24,GARY,Screw that.
11513,L59475,u406,m24,RICK,Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
11514,L59474,u395,m24,GARY,I'm going to see what the hell happened.
11515,L59473,u406,m24,RICK,Guy paints a beautiful picture.
11516,L59472,u395,m24,GARY,This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
11517,L59471,u406,m24,RICK,It's true.
11518,L59468,u395,m24,GARY,What's going on?
11519,L59467,u406,m24,RICK,Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
11520,L59148,u395,m24,GARY,Let's have a toast.
11521,L59147,u406,m24,RICK,"Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will."
11522,L59140,u406,m24,RICK,Because I love her. What can I tell you?
11523,L59139,u395,m24,GARY,Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
11524,L59130,u406,m24,RICK,"All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is."
11525,L59129,u395,m24,GARY,"Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?"
11526,L59107,u406,m24,RICK,"Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody."
11527,L59106,u395,m24,GARY,Let's go.
11528,L59103,u395,m24,GARY,Screw you...
11529,L59102,u406,m24,RICK,"Gary, you're quite an animal."
11530,L59101,u395,m24,GARY,"Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys."
11531,L59593,u395,m24,GARY,Milt?
11532,L59592,u405,m24,RAJAH,Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
11533,L59591,u395,m24,GARY,Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
11534,L59590,u405,m24,RAJAH,You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
11535,L59589,u395,m24,GARY,I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
11536,L59588,u405,m24,RAJAH,Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
11537,L59587,u395,m24,GARY,I'll take some.
11538,L59586,u405,m24,RAJAH,"That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want."
11539,L59585,u395,m24,GARY,I want women.
11540,L59584,u405,m24,RAJAH,"I'm telling you I am, Joe."
11541,L59583,u395,m24,GARY,You're a pimp?
11542,L59582,u405,m24,RAJAH,What can I be doing for you?
11543,L59853,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Good.
11544,L59852,u398,m24,LARRY,That's it.
11545,L59851,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Is that all the coke in the place?
11546,L59341,u398,m24,LARRY,I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
11547,L59340,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"Larry, you and your wife got problems?"
11548,L59339,u398,m24,LARRY,"I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch."
11549,L59337,u398,m24,LARRY,"Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody."
11550,L59336,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"So, Larry, how have you been?"
11551,L59835,u406,m24,RICK,"It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful..."
11552,L59834,u398,m24,LARRY,It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
11553,L59823,u398,m24,LARRY,It's Bullwinkle.
11554,L59822,u406,m24,RICK,"Hi, guys. We brought back a friend."
11555,L59704,u406,m24,RICK,"No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party."
11556,L59703,u398,m24,LARRY,"Ha, ha, ha."
11557,L59702,u406,m24,RICK,"Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up."
11558,L59701,u398,m24,LARRY,I couldn't find any razor blades.
11559,L59700,u406,m24,RICK,You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
11560,L59699,u398,m24,LARRY,I'm trying to slash my wrists.
11561,L59698,u406,m24,RICK,What the hell are you doing?
11562,L59606,u398,m24,LARRY,"Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party."
11563,L59605,u406,m24,RICK,Really?
11564,L59604,u398,m24,LARRY,"Yeah, I guess so."
11565,L59603,u406,m24,RICK,You okay?
11566,L59602,u398,m24,LARRY,"No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now."
11567,L59601,u406,m24,RICK,Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
11568,L59552,u406,m24,RICK,"All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after ""Falcon Crest."""
11569,L59551,u398,m24,LARRY,I just want to be alone.
11570,L59550,u406,m24,RICK,"C'mon, Larry. Be good for you."
11571,L59549,u398,m24,LARRY,"Guys, I think I'd rather stay here."
11572,L59348,u406,m24,RICK,"What do you mean, it changes?"
11573,L59347,u398,m24,LARRY,"She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?"
11574,L59346,u406,m24,RICK,Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
11575,L59345,u398,m24,LARRY,My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
11576,L59344,u398,m24,LARRY,Right.
11577,L59343,u406,m24,RICK,"Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck."
11578,L59342,u398,m24,LARRY,You want to share it?
11579,L59912,u406,m24,RICK,"Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!"
11580,L59911,u399,m24,MANAGER,You're all under arrest. Open up!
11581,L59406,u406,m24,RICK,I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
11582,L59405,u399,m24,MANAGER,Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
11583,L59404,u406,m24,RICK,"What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later."
11584,L59403,u399,m24,MANAGER,It's on the tenth floor.
11585,L59402,u406,m24,RICK,"Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002."
11586,L59401,u399,m24,MANAGER,This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
11587,L59400,u406,m24,RICK,Are any of those right?
11588,L59910,u406,m24,RICK,"Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E."
11589,L59909,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
11590,L59856,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,No sob story is going to change my mind.
11591,L59855,u406,m24,RICK,The end.
11592,L59842,u406,m24,RICK,"Oh, no!"
11593,L59841,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,Rick!
11594,L59840,u406,m24,RICK,"Welcome, welcome, one and all."
11595,L59244,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life..."
11596,L59243,u406,m24,RICK,Feel free.
11597,L59242,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions..."
11598,L59241,u406,m24,RICK,"Mr. Thomerson, I..."
11599,L59240,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes."
11600,L59239,u406,m24,RICK,I'd love that.
11601,L59238,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"Rick, I want to cut through the b.s."
11602,L59237,u406,m24,RICK,"Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience."
11603,L59233,u406,m24,RICK,Can't I just maim it a little?
11604,L59232,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it."
11605,L59230,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"All right, who serves?"
11606,L59229,u406,m24,RICK,Oops!
11607,L59920,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,It's all right...  So have I.
11608,L59919,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"No, Brett, I..."
11609,L59918,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,You've been having strange sex...!
11610,L59917,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,The phone made me do it!
11611,L59916,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,Ed... you're kinky!
11612,L59278,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,You can tell a man by his friends.
11613,L59277,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
11614,L59253,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,"In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words."
11615,L59252,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,"Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?"
11616,L59235,u401,m24,MR. THOMERSON,No. Let's at least finish the set.
11617,L59234,u402,m24,MRS. THOMERSON,Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
11618,L59083,u410,m24,WOMAN,Of course.
11619,L59082,u403,m24,O'NEILL,I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
11620,L59078,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
11621,L59077,u410,m24,WOMAN,I'm separated.
11622,L59076,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Mrs.?
11623,L59075,u410,m24,WOMAN,Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
11624,L59074,u403,m24,O'NEILL,How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
11625,L59879,u403,m24,O'NEILL,You got it.
11626,L59878,u406,m24,RICK,"I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom."
11627,L59877,u403,m24,O'NEILL,What's with her costume?
11628,L59876,u406,m24,RICK,My Debbie?
11629,L59875,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Debbie.
11630,L59874,u406,m24,RICK,Who?
11631,L59873,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
11632,L59860,u406,m24,RICK,I'm saved. Let's party!
11633,L59859,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Reach out and snort someone.
11634,L59847,u403,m24,O'NEILL,I'll stop him... You stall him.
11635,L59846,u406,m24,RICK,What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
11636,L59845,u403,m24,O'NEILL,What are you going to do about it?
11637,L59826,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree..."
11638,L59825,u406,m24,RICK,"How about this, a Trojan donkey."
11639,L59806,u406,m24,RICK,Who's your friend?
11640,L59805,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"Hey, you guys..."
11641,L59784,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Take care.
11642,L59783,u406,m24,RICK,"Now, don't get into any trouble."
11643,L59744,u406,m24,RICK,C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
11644,L59743,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Very.
11645,L59742,u406,m24,RICK,He look familiar?
11646,L59741,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Still drawing a blank.
11647,L59740,u406,m24,RICK,How 'bout this?
11648,L59739,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Got me.
11649,L59738,u406,m24,RICK,What's this?
11650,L59737,u403,m24,O'NEILL,I don't know.
11651,L59736,u406,m24,RICK,Who was that?
11652,L59733,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"I'm proud of you, lad."
11653,L59732,u406,m24,RICK,"Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister."
11654,L59731,u403,m24,O'NEILL,How'd it go?
11655,L59720,u403,m24,O'NEILL,That's the old Rick!
11656,L59719,u406,m24,RICK,"If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics."
11657,L59718,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"Right in there, pal."
11658,L59717,u406,m24,RICK,Oooooo.
11659,L59716,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please."
11660,L59715,u406,m24,RICK,"Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens."
11661,L59714,u403,m24,O'NEILL,This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
11662,L59713,u406,m24,RICK,About what?
11663,L59712,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"Rick, I'm concerned."
11664,L59656,u406,m24,RICK,I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
11665,L59655,u403,m24,O'NEILL,I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
11666,L59654,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"So long, Father."
11667,L59653,u406,m24,RICK,I think you'll enjoy this table.
11668,L59638,u403,m24,O'NEILL,The best table in the house.
11669,L59637,u406,m24,RICK,Under the table!
11670,L59636,u403,m24,O'NEILL,My gift to you.
11671,L59635,u406,m24,RICK,What the hell is that?
11672,L59632,u403,m24,O'NEILL,C'mon. I insist.
11673,L59631,u406,m24,RICK,I'm not really hungry.
11674,L59630,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody."
11675,L59629,u406,m24,RICK,Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
11676,L59439,u403,m24,O'NEILL,This isn't right.
11677,L59438,u406,m24,RICK,"Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican."
11678,L59428,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Then it's on to the real thing.
11679,L59427,u406,m24,RICK,"Olivier's in that, right?"
11680,L59426,u403,m24,O'NEILL,"We'll spend an hour with ""Nymphos Without Pants""..."
11681,L59375,u406,m24,RICK,Nothing... Let's get crazy!
11682,L59374,u403,m24,O'NEILL,What's the matter?
11683,L59330,u406,m24,RICK,"Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight."
11684,L59329,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Where the hell is he?
11685,L59087,u406,m24,RICK,"She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce."
11686,L59086,u403,m24,O'NEILL,Where'd she go?
11687,L59808,u406,m24,RICK,"Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?"
11688,L59807,u409,m24,STAN,Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
11689,L59690,u406,m24,RICK,"Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help."
11690,L59689,u409,m24,STAN,"Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts."
11691,L59688,u406,m24,RICK,"Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?"
11692,L59687,u409,m24,STAN,"Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next."
11693,L59665,u409,m24,STAN,Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
11694,L59664,u406,m24,RICK,"Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break."
11695,L59222,u409,m24,STAN,"Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action."
11696,L59221,u406,m24,RICK,That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
11697,L59220,u406,m24,RICK,"Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?"
11698,L59219,u409,m24,STAN,"You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that."
11699,L59218,u406,m24,RICK,"True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?"
11700,L59217,u409,m24,STAN,"Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me."
11701,L59216,u406,m24,RICK,"You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky."
11702,L59066,u406,m24,RICK,Right... Think it over.
11703,L59065,u408,m24,SISTER MARY FRANCIS,"Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is."
11704,L59064,u406,m24,RICK,"Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book."
11705,L59062,u406,m24,RICK,"You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak."
11706,L59061,u408,m24,SISTER MARY FRANCIS,There can be no excuse for tardiness.
11707,L59060,u406,m24,RICK,"I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse."
11708,L59059,u408,m24,SISTER MARY FRANCIS,"You're late again, Rick."
11709,L59804,u409,m24,STAN,Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
11710,L59803,u407,m24,RYKO,Can you believe how perfect it fits?
11711,L59802,u409,m24,STAN,I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
11712,L59801,u407,m24,RYKO,Maybe I did... I don't remember.
11713,L59800,u409,m24,STAN,What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
11714,L59799,u407,m24,RYKO,I don't know.
11715,L59798,u409,m24,STAN,How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
11716,L60866,u411,m25,AXE,Stevie... I...
11717,L60865,u421,m25,STEPHEN,You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
11718,L60859,u421,m25,STEPHEN,There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
11719,L60858,u411,m25,AXE,"...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?"
11720,L60851,u411,m25,AXE,"-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --"
11721,L60850,u421,m25,STEPHEN,-- Knock it off!
11722,L60844,u411,m25,AXE,"They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department."
11723,L60843,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman."
11724,L60842,u411,m25,AXE,"Aw man, Stephen, listen to me..."
11725,L60609,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
11726,L60608,u411,m25,AXE,"Let me take the lead, Stephen..."
11727,L60607,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here."
11728,L60606,u411,m25,AXE,"It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one."
11729,L60605,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side."
11730,L60336,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"We're gonna be okay, man..."
11731,L60335,u411,m25,AXE,Biggest in two battalions.
11732,L60334,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?"
11733,L60333,u411,m25,AXE,Yeah...
11734,L60332,u421,m25,STEPHEN,You know Knowlton pretty well?
11735,L60303,u421,m25,STEPHEN,No.  I need a drink.
11736,L60302,u411,m25,AXE,"Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?"
11737,L60209,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose."
11738,L60208,u411,m25,AXE,That's Franny. She likes firemen.
11739,L60134,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling."
11740,L60133,u411,m25,AXE,"It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it."
11741,L60132,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on."
11742,L60131,u411,m25,AXE,Wash it to the windows?
11743,L60126,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Be gentle.
11744,L60125,u411,m25,AXE,Oh these moments do try me...
11745,L60855,u411,m25,AXE,-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
11746,L60854,u412,m25,BRIAN,"-- Stephen, this is bullshit --"
11747,L60853,u411,m25,AXE,-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
11748,L60852,u412,m25,BRIAN,-- He killed people --
11749,L60849,u411,m25,AXE,-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
11750,L60848,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Just come down, John. Just --"
11751,L60847,u411,m25,AXE,You gotta let me finish --
11752,L60846,u411,m25,AXE,"That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!"
11753,L60845,u412,m25,BRIAN,Did you do it for Tim?
11754,L60622,u411,m25,AXE,He's alive.
11755,L60621,u412,m25,BRIAN,Is he...
11756,L60183,u412,m25,BRIAN,"John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see..."
11757,L60182,u411,m25,AXE,"Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family."
11758,L60181,u412,m25,BRIAN,My Lt. might have something to say about that.
11759,L60180,u411,m25,AXE,"Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay."
11760,L60881,u412,m25,BRIAN,I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
11761,L60880,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
11762,L60864,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm..."
11763,L60863,u412,m25,BRIAN,"""You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"""
11764,L60862,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?"
11765,L60857,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Shut up!
11766,L60856,u412,m25,BRIAN,"You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?"
11767,L60836,u421,m25,STEPHEN,I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
11768,L60835,u412,m25,BRIAN,"We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen."
11769,L60834,u421,m25,STEPHEN,I'll handle it.
11770,L60833,u412,m25,BRIAN,What are we going to do about this?
11771,L60832,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Anything else?
11772,L60827,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"They were for the fucking boat, Brian."
11773,L60826,u412,m25,BRIAN,-- What were they doing there?
11774,L60825,u421,m25,STEPHEN,I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
11775,L60824,u412,m25,BRIAN,How do you know?
11776,L60823,u421,m25,STEPHEN,I know.
11777,L60822,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!"
11778,L60821,u421,m25,STEPHEN,-- What are you doing here?
11779,L60820,u412,m25,BRIAN,"-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --"
11780,L60819,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"I don't know, Brian... I don't know..."
11781,L60818,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?"
11782,L60817,u412,m25,BRIAN,Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
11783,L60816,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian."
11784,L60815,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on..."
11785,L60814,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?"
11786,L60813,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die."
11787,L60812,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Everybody did.
11788,L60811,u412,m25,BRIAN,"When dad died, I saw another fire..."
11789,L60810,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Saw what?
11790,L60809,u412,m25,BRIAN,I saw it.
11791,L60808,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go..."
11792,L60807,u412,m25,BRIAN,"It's okay, Stephen, I --"
11793,L60806,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!"
11794,L60805,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --"
11795,L60804,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay."
11796,L60803,u412,m25,BRIAN,I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
11797,L60802,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them..."
11798,L60801,u412,m25,BRIAN,You're selling dad's boat?
11799,L60800,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes."
11800,L60799,u421,m25,STEPHEN,So hello.
11801,L60798,u412,m25,BRIAN,Just... Just wanted to say hello...
11802,L60797,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
11803,L60632,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Fuck you.
11804,L60631,u412,m25,BRIAN,"He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him."
11805,L60630,u421,m25,STEPHEN,I had that fire. He didn't listen!
11806,L60629,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?"
11807,L60628,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"...Not now, Brian."
11808,L60468,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Just leave me alone, okay?"
11809,L60467,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Brian, look --"
11810,L60466,u412,m25,BRIAN,Thanks for the insight.
11811,L60465,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game."
11812,L60369,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?"
11813,L60368,u412,m25,BRIAN,Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
11814,L60367,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way."
11815,L60366,u412,m25,BRIAN,I waited... I would have fucking waited...
11816,L60365,u421,m25,STEPHEN,You okay?
11817,L60362,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us."
11818,L60361,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team..."
11819,L60360,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Ready?
11820,L60354,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Roll the hose.
11821,L60353,u412,m25,BRIAN,"No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me."
11822,L60352,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"You got a problem with drilling, probie?"
11823,L60351,u412,m25,BRIAN,"What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time."
11824,L60349,u412,m25,BRIAN,"What, are you kidding? By myself?"
11825,L60348,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Roll the hose.
11826,L60317,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Yeah... too bright...
11827,L60316,u412,m25,BRIAN,This?
11828,L60315,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind..."
11829,L60311,u412,m25,BRIAN,"C'mon, let's crawl home."
11830,L60310,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too."
11831,L60308,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?"
11832,L60307,u412,m25,BRIAN,So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
11833,L60235,u412,m25,BRIAN,Hey.
11834,L60234,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Hey.
11835,L60233,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
11836,L60232,u412,m25,BRIAN,Thanks.
11837,L60185,u412,m25,BRIAN,-- Never mind.
11838,L60184,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose..."
11839,L60170,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right."
11840,L60169,u412,m25,BRIAN,"-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!"
11841,L60168,u421,m25,STEPHEN,-- I told you to stay next to me!
11842,L60167,u412,m25,BRIAN,Goddamn it Stephen!
11843,L60166,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before."
11844,L60165,u412,m25,BRIAN,"-- C'mon, Stephen."
11845,L60164,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me."
11846,L60138,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
11847,L60137,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I'm in heaven, Lt."
11848,L60136,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Ya love it, probie?"
11849,L60114,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow."
11850,L60113,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know."
11851,L60112,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like."
11852,L60111,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt..."
11853,L60110,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Thanks for the speakers.
11854,L60109,u412,m25,BRIAN,There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
11855,L60108,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
11856,L60107,u412,m25,BRIAN,So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
11857,L60106,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?"
11858,L60105,u412,m25,BRIAN,Hey! You don't know me --
11859,L60104,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man."
11860,L60103,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother ""you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed"" games?"
11861,L60102,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Why'd you come here, Brian?"
11862,L60101,u421,m25,STEPHEN,That was never proved.
11863,L60100,u412,m25,BRIAN,Yeah? What about Laura --
11864,L60099,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Sheep don't count.
11865,L60098,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors."
11866,L60097,u421,m25,STEPHEN,People actually used to pay you for this?
11867,L60096,u412,m25,BRIAN,It worked when you were in sixth grade.
11868,L60095,u421,m25,STEPHEN,It works.
11869,L60094,u412,m25,BRIAN,In the Field Museum once.
11870,L60093,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"What, you've never seen one before?"
11871,L60092,u412,m25,BRIAN,"My God, an actual operating 8-track."
11872,L60090,u421,m25,STEPHEN,It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
11873,L60089,u412,m25,BRIAN,Been ripping off fire stations?
11874,L60088,u421,m25,STEPHEN,It's comin' along... want a beer?
11875,L60087,u412,m25,BRIAN,I like what you've done with the place.
11876,L60054,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian..."
11877,L60053,u412,m25,BRIAN,Not likely.
11878,L60052,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother."
11879,L60051,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"So you're going to fight fires now, huh?"
11880,L60050,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me."
11881,L60049,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?"
11882,L59962,u421,m25,STEPHEN,If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
11883,L59961,u412,m25,BRIAN,Who asked you?
11884,L59960,u421,m25,STEPHEN,It doesn't go like that.
11885,L60908,u417,m25,JENNIFER,It's a small town.
11886,L60907,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I'll see ya around, huh?"
11887,L60906,u417,m25,JENNIFER,I don't have the slightest idea...
11888,L60905,u412,m25,BRIAN,What'll you do?
11889,L60904,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"I quit two days ago, Brian."
11890,L60903,u412,m25,BRIAN,I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
11891,L60746,u412,m25,BRIAN,You're right.
11892,L60745,u417,m25,JENNIFER,That's a dumb thing to say.
11893,L60744,u412,m25,BRIAN,I'm sorry.
11894,L60743,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Just take it.
11895,L60742,u412,m25,BRIAN,What is --
11896,L60720,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Your boss is lying, Jennifer."
11897,L60719,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?"
11898,L60718,u412,m25,BRIAN,Yes.
11899,L60717,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Do you know what you're asking me to do?
11900,L60716,u412,m25,BRIAN,You could check. It'd be in his files.
11901,L60715,u417,m25,JENNIFER,I don't know anything about it.
11902,L60714,u412,m25,BRIAN,Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
11903,L60713,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --"
11904,L60712,u412,m25,BRIAN,Hi.
11905,L60711,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Hi.
11906,L60647,u417,m25,JENNIFER,You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
11907,L60646,u412,m25,BRIAN,-- I work for the city.
11908,L60645,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --"
11909,L60644,u412,m25,BRIAN,Leave Stephen out of this --
11910,L60643,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --"
11911,L60642,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Yeah? And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""?"
11912,L60641,u417,m25,JENNIFER,I was doing my job.
11913,L60640,u412,m25,BRIAN,-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
11914,L60639,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --"
11915,L60638,u412,m25,BRIAN,-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
11916,L60637,u417,m25,JENNIFER,I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
11917,L60636,u412,m25,BRIAN,You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
11918,L60635,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Brian. What's wrong?
11919,L60591,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Uh huh.
11920,L60590,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose."
11921,L60587,u412,m25,BRIAN,I wanted to be a good one.
11922,L60586,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Then why did you quit?
11923,L60585,u412,m25,BRIAN,"When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman."
11924,L60584,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
11925,L60583,u412,m25,BRIAN,"See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?"
11926,L60582,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Homey.
11927,L60581,u412,m25,BRIAN,This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
11928,L60580,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies."
11929,L60579,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Got anything to drink in there?
11930,L60578,u412,m25,BRIAN,Thanks for the invite.
11931,L60576,u412,m25,BRIAN,"In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah."
11932,L60575,u417,m25,JENNIFER,But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
11933,L60574,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked."
11934,L60573,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not."
11935,L60572,u412,m25,BRIAN,"No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one."
11936,L60571,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?"
11937,L60570,u412,m25,BRIAN,Okay.
11938,L60564,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
11939,L60563,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Well, you did invite me here."
11940,L60562,u417,m25,JENNIFER,You think that's really any of your business?
11941,L60561,u412,m25,BRIAN,Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
11942,L60560,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes..."
11943,L60559,u412,m25,BRIAN,Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
11944,L60558,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Hi.
11945,L60542,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in..."
11946,L60541,u417,m25,JENNIFER,I could use a date.
11947,L60540,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here."
11948,L60539,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
11949,L60538,u412,m25,BRIAN,Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
11950,L60537,u417,m25,JENNIFER,How's it going?
11951,L60536,u412,m25,BRIAN,Hey.
11952,L60535,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
11953,L60534,u412,m25,BRIAN,Arson.
11954,L60377,u412,m25,BRIAN,Yeah...
11955,L60376,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian."
11956,L60375,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it."
11957,L60284,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them."
11958,L60283,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us."
11959,L60282,u412,m25,BRIAN,So now you suddenly care about my future?
11960,L60281,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once."
11961,L60280,u412,m25,BRIAN,"C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth."
11962,L60279,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that."
11963,L60252,u412,m25,BRIAN,I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
11964,L60251,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters."
11965,L60250,u412,m25,BRIAN,"What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard."
11966,L60247,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?"
11967,L60246,u412,m25,BRIAN,-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
11968,L60245,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
11969,L60244,u412,m25,BRIAN,Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
11970,L60243,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
11971,L60242,u412,m25,BRIAN,Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
11972,L60241,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here."
11973,L60240,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?"
11974,L60239,u417,m25,JENNIFER,When I was twenty.
11975,L60238,u412,m25,BRIAN,"With grenadine, right?"
11976,L60040,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"I don't want to be your friend, Brian."
11977,L60039,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends."
11978,L60035,u417,m25,JENNIFER,"What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission."
11979,L60034,u412,m25,BRIAN,Really? No kidding.
11980,L60033,u417,m25,JENNIFER,I work for city hall.
11981,L60032,u412,m25,BRIAN,Yeah? What have you been up to?
11982,L60031,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
11983,L60030,u412,m25,BRIAN,So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
11984,L60029,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Huh.
11985,L60028,u412,m25,BRIAN,Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
11986,L60027,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Thanks for calling.
11987,L60026,u412,m25,BRIAN,You look great.
11988,L60025,u417,m25,JENNIFER,You're back.
11989,L60024,u412,m25,BRIAN,Jennifer.
11990,L60023,u417,m25,JENNIFER,Brian.
11991,L60795,u419,m25,RONALD,"Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?"
11992,L60794,u412,m25,BRIAN,Oh Jesus Christ...
11993,L60790,u419,m25,RONALD,After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
11994,L60789,u412,m25,BRIAN,Who the fuck is doing this?
11995,L60788,u419,m25,RONALD,"Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?"
11996,L60787,u412,m25,BRIAN,Trychticholorate.
11997,L60786,u419,m25,RONALD,"That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian."
11998,L60785,u412,m25,BRIAN,The outlets.
11999,L60784,u419,m25,RONALD,"Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen."
12000,L60783,u412,m25,BRIAN,-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
12001,L60782,u419,m25,RONALD,"Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!"
12002,L60781,u412,m25,BRIAN,I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
12003,L60780,u419,m25,RONALD,"You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --"
12004,L60779,u412,m25,BRIAN,What?
12005,L60778,u419,m25,RONALD,"Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?"
12006,L60777,u419,m25,RONALD,Sure you do.
12007,L60776,u412,m25,BRIAN,I don't have a story.
12008,L60775,u419,m25,RONALD,"-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story."
12009,L60774,u412,m25,BRIAN,Then who --
12010,L60773,u419,m25,RONALD,"Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?"
12011,L60772,u412,m25,BRIAN,Who's doing this?
12012,L60771,u419,m25,RONALD,"Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?"
12013,L60770,u419,m25,RONALD,"So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all..."
12014,L60769,u412,m25,BRIAN,I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
12015,L60398,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Hey, do I know you?"
12016,L60397,u419,m25,RONALD,"Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?"
12017,L59997,u412,m25,BRIAN,See you Monday. Sir.
12018,L59996,u413,m25,CHIEF FITZGERALD,"Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you."
12019,L59995,u412,m25,BRIAN,"No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir."
12020,L59994,u413,m25,CHIEF FITZGERALD,"Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year."
12021,L59993,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I need another one, sir."
12022,L59992,u413,m25,CHIEF FITZGERALD,"-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot."
12023,L59991,u412,m25,BRIAN,"If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --"
12024,L59990,u413,m25,CHIEF FITZGERALD,"Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?"
12025,L59989,u412,m25,BRIAN,"I want another shot, Sir."
12026,L59988,u413,m25,CHIEF FITZGERALD,You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
12027,L59987,u412,m25,BRIAN,"If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing."
12028,L60893,u412,m25,BRIAN,Like it never happened...
12029,L60892,u420,m25,SHADOW,Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
12030,L60891,u412,m25,BRIAN,Yeah.
12031,L60890,u420,m25,SHADOW,Your brother was a good man.
12032,L60767,u420,m25,SHADOW,"I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place..."
12033,L60766,u412,m25,BRIAN,So what do you want me to do?
12034,L60765,u420,m25,SHADOW,I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
12035,L60764,u412,m25,BRIAN,Just wondering.
12036,L60763,u420,m25,SHADOW,No.
12037,L60762,u412,m25,BRIAN,Did I say thanks?
12038,L60761,u420,m25,SHADOW,Yeah.
12039,L60760,u412,m25,BRIAN,Did you pull me out?
12040,L60759,u412,m25,BRIAN,How ya feeling?
12041,L60758,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now..."
12042,L60754,u420,m25,SHADOW,It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
12043,L60753,u412,m25,BRIAN,Then who wrote the report?
12044,L60752,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box."
12045,L60751,u412,m25,BRIAN,I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
12046,L60750,u412,m25,BRIAN,Yeah? Airtight?
12047,L60749,u420,m25,SHADOW,This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
12048,L60709,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared."
12049,L60708,u412,m25,BRIAN,Nice bunch of guys.
12050,L60707,u420,m25,SHADOW,"And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either."
12051,L60706,u412,m25,BRIAN,So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
12052,L60705,u420,m25,SHADOW,Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
12053,L60704,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb."
12054,L60672,u412,m25,BRIAN,Fire.
12055,L60671,u420,m25,SHADOW,"In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?"
12056,L60665,u412,m25,BRIAN,I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
12057,L60664,u420,m25,SHADOW,What the hell are you doing here?
12058,L60557,u420,m25,SHADOW,No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
12059,L60556,u412,m25,BRIAN,Are you going public with this?
12060,L60555,u420,m25,SHADOW,"No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point."
12061,L60554,u412,m25,BRIAN,"That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?"
12062,L60553,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out."
12063,L60552,u412,m25,BRIAN,What reason?
12064,L60551,u420,m25,SHADOW,But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
12065,L60550,u412,m25,BRIAN,But he killed these guys.
12066,L60549,u420,m25,SHADOW,I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.
12067,L60548,u412,m25,BRIAN,What?
12068,L60547,u420,m25,SHADOW,"That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!"
12069,L60533,u420,m25,SHADOW,"I don't work for them, either."
12070,L60532,u412,m25,BRIAN,Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
12071,L60531,u420,m25,SHADOW,I don't guess.
12072,L60530,u412,m25,BRIAN,But the right guess on this is arson.
12073,L60529,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier"
12074,L60528,u412,m25,BRIAN,And the putty around the door?
12075,L60527,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes."
12076,L60526,u412,m25,BRIAN,Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
12077,L60525,u420,m25,SHADOW,Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
12078,L60524,u420,m25,SHADOW,Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
12079,L60523,u412,m25,BRIAN,"""During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium""."
12080,L60522,u420,m25,SHADOW,-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
12081,L60521,u412,m25,BRIAN,"""Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"""
12082,L60520,u420,m25,SHADOW,Read.
12083,L60512,u420,m25,SHADOW,I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
12084,L60511,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Uh, I don't think that's in my contract..."
12085,L60445,u412,m25,BRIAN,No it couldn't.
12086,L60444,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire."
12087,L60441,u412,m25,BRIAN,-- Another backdraft.
12088,L60440,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air..."
12089,L60439,u420,m25,SHADOW,Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
12090,L60438,u412,m25,BRIAN,Glass?
12091,L60437,u420,m25,SHADOW,"So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass."
12092,L60434,u412,m25,BRIAN,What are you listening to?
12093,L60433,u420,m25,SHADOW,-- Shhh.
12094,L60388,u420,m25,SHADOW,Pest control.
12095,L60387,u412,m25,BRIAN,Where are you going?
12096,L60386,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?"
12097,L60385,u412,m25,BRIAN,I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
12098,L60384,u420,m25,SHADOW,Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
12099,L60383,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere."
12100,L60382,u420,m25,SHADOW,Are you still here?
12101,L60381,u420,m25,SHADOW,Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
12102,L60380,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant."
12103,L60083,u416,m25,HELEN,You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
12104,L60082,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Oh, man, I'm sorry."
12105,L60081,u416,m25,HELEN,"Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April."
12106,L60080,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?"
12107,L60078,u416,m25,HELEN,Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.

12113,L60071,u412,m25,BRIAN,Four months.
12114,L60070,u416,m25,HELEN,'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
12115,L60069,u416,m25,HELEN,You look like... Brian.
12116,L60068,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Hi, Helen. Man, you look great."
12117,L60067,u416,m25,HELEN,Brian?
12118,L60649,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight."
12119,L60648,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
12120,L60567,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
12121,L60566,u412,m25,BRIAN,Nice boat.
12122,L60565,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,Mr. McCaffrey...
12123,L60277,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,"Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine."
12124,L60276,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young."
12125,L60275,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,"This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan."
12126,L60274,u412,m25,BRIAN,I have a job.
12127,L60273,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,"Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job."
12128,L60272,u412,m25,BRIAN,Every little boy's fantasy.
12129,L60271,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,"-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command."
12130,L60270,u412,m25,BRIAN,"No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin."
12131,L60269,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,"No need to be modest, Brian."
12132,L60268,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman."
12133,L60267,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,"And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian."
12134,L60266,u412,m25,BRIAN,Yeah. Big fan.
12135,L60454,u412,m25,BRIAN,Swayzak's not my boss.
12136,L60453,u423,m25,TIM,"There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed."
12137,L60452,u412,m25,BRIAN,"So, you surviving without me?"
12138,L60260,u423,m25,TIM,"""Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."""
12139,L60259,u412,m25,BRIAN,What?
12140,L60215,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning."
12141,L60214,u423,m25,TIM,"Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? ""You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it""."
12142,L60213,u423,m25,TIM,"Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch."
12143,L60212,u412,m25,BRIAN,Do you have to do that?
12144,L60048,u412,m25,BRIAN,Backdraft.
12145,L60047,u423,m25,TIM,Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
12146,L60020,u423,m25,TIM,"Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?"
12147,L60019,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station."
12148,L60018,u423,m25,TIM,You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
12149,L60017,u412,m25,BRIAN,Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
12150,L60016,u423,m25,TIM,How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
12151,L60015,u412,m25,BRIAN,"Engine 115, right?"
12152,L60014,u423,m25,TIM,Aren't you even curious?
12153,L60000,u423,m25,TIM,What the hell are we waiting for?
12154,L59999,u412,m25,BRIAN,Completely out of control.
12155,L60013,u424,m25,WILLY,"You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for ""Brian McCaffrey, Fireman""..."
12156,L60012,u412,m25,BRIAN,I was ahead of my time.
12157,L60011,u424,m25,WILLY,"And just this year, ""Brian's Sound Spectrum"". Your own company even. Big step."
12158,L60010,u412,m25,BRIAN,Coffee sucked.
12159,L60009,u424,m25,WILLY,"""Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards""?"
12160,L60008,u412,m25,BRIAN,Management were pin heads.
12161,L60007,u424,m25,WILLY,"Uh huh. And ""Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins"". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?"
12162,L60006,u412,m25,BRIAN,Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
12163,L60005,u424,m25,WILLY,"Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was ""in your blood"". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... ""Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."""
12164,L60004,u412,m25,BRIAN,"It's in my blood, Willy."
12165,L60003,u424,m25,WILLY,"Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform."
12166,L59979,u414,m25,DENNIS,"You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?"
12167,L59978,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Dad!
12168,L59973,u414,m25,DENNIS,Cute.
12169,L59972,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Firehouse.
12170,L59971,u414,m25,DENNIS,"Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?"
12171,L59970,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Fireman shit?
12172,L59967,u421,m25,STEPHEN,And DIE!
12173,L59966,u414,m25,DENNIS,Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
12174,L59965,u414,m25,DENNIS,"Well, let's have a look."
12175,L59964,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right."
12176,L59963,u414,m25,DENNIS,Who's going to die?
12177,L60831,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"I'll be there, goddamn it!"
12178,L60830,u415,m25,GRINDLE,They're waitin' man.
12179,L60829,u421,m25,STEPHEN,I'll be there.
12180,L60828,u415,m25,GRINDLE,"We gotta roll, Stevie..."
12181,L60692,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?"
12182,L60691,u415,m25,GRINDLE,He just wants to --
12183,L60690,u421,m25,STEPHEN,I'm busy.
12184,L60689,u415,m25,GRINDLE,Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
12185,L60124,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
12186,L60123,u415,m25,GRINDLE,I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
12187,L60730,u416,m25,HELEN,"I don't want to confuse him, Stephen."
12188,L60729,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano."
12189,L60728,u416,m25,HELEN,"-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean..."
12190,L60727,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Look, I'm sorry I --"
12191,L60726,u416,m25,HELEN,Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
12192,L60725,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
12193,L60724,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you."
12194,L60723,u416,m25,HELEN,What's wrong?
12195,L60722,u421,m25,STEPHEN,I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
12196,L60499,u416,m25,HELEN,You can't keep being his father...
12197,L60498,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't..."
12198,L60497,u416,m25,HELEN,Yeah? When was the last time?
12199,L60496,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong."
12200,L60495,u416,m25,HELEN,"Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right."
12201,L60494,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror."
12202,L60493,u416,m25,HELEN,"I know he's out, but how's he doing?"
12203,L60492,u421,m25,STEPHEN,He's out.
12204,L60491,u416,m25,HELEN,"What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?"
12205,L60490,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Coffee? Nah, I gotta go."
12206,L60489,u416,m25,HELEN,You want some coffee?
12207,L60488,u416,m25,HELEN,You treated me like shit.
12208,L60487,u421,m25,STEPHEN,I treated you better.
12209,L60486,u416,m25,HELEN,Okay.
12210,L60485,u421,m25,STEPHEN,He treats you okay?
12211,L60484,u416,m25,HELEN,He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
12212,L60483,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Sorry I hit Jackson.
12213,L60482,u416,m25,HELEN,The great communicator.
12214,L60481,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something."
12215,L60480,u416,m25,HELEN,-- You remember.
12216,L60479,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --"
12217,L60478,u416,m25,HELEN,"Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this."
12218,L60477,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried..."
12219,L60476,u416,m25,HELEN,He's going to be a fireman.
12220,L60475,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Oh yeah? How's he doing?
12221,L60474,u416,m25,HELEN,He's got piano lessons.
12222,L60473,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Where's Sean?
12223,L60472,u416,m25,HELEN,It's not your roof anymore.
12224,L60471,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Fixing my roof.
12225,L60470,u416,m25,HELEN,"Stephen, what are you doing here?"
12226,L60299,u416,m25,HELEN,Here we go...
12227,L60298,u421,m25,STEPHEN,You can't talk about my brother like that...
12228,L60291,u416,m25,HELEN,"Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?"
12229,L60290,u421,m25,STEPHEN,"Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean..."
12230,L60518,u418,m25,RICCO,That's your job.
12231,L60517,u420,m25,SHADOW,What the hell was it doing in the fire?
12232,L60516,u418,m25,RICCO,Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
12233,L60515,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago."
12234,L60514,u418,m25,RICCO,See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
12235,L60510,u420,m25,SHADOW,"McCaffrey, hold this for us."
12236,L60509,u418,m25,RICCO,"Anyway, down here, take a look..."
12237,L60506,u418,m25,RICCO,There's something else kinda interesting...
12238,L60505,u420,m25,SHADOW,Putty? On both doors?
12239,L60504,u418,m25,RICCO,They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
12240,L60427,u419,m25,RONALD,-- Burn it all.
12241,L60426,u420,m25,SHADOW,And the world -- the whole world.
12242,L60425,u419,m25,RONALD,-- Burn them.
12243,L60424,u420,m25,SHADOW,And old ladies?
12244,L60423,u419,m25,RONALD,-- Burn them.
12245,L60419,u419,m25,RONALD,Absolutely.
12246,L60418,u420,m25,SHADOW,Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
12247,L60407,u419,m25,RONALD,"Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here..."
12248,L60406,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Nobody cares, Ronald."
12249,L60405,u419,m25,RONALD,Did he tell you how we finally met?
12250,L60404,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?"
12251,L60403,u419,m25,RONALD,"Tell him about me, Shadow?"
12252,L60402,u420,m25,SHADOW,Knock it off. Now.
12253,L60400,u419,m25,RONALD,I know you.
12254,L60399,u420,m25,SHADOW,You don't know him.
12255,L60396,u420,m25,SHADOW,"You like everybody, Ronald."
12256,L60395,u419,m25,RONALD,Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
12257,L60394,u420,m25,SHADOW,He works for me.
12258,L60393,u419,m25,RONALD,Who's this?
12259,L60392,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal."
12260,L60391,u419,m25,RONALD,Didn't think you'd make it.
12261,L60390,u420,m25,SHADOW,"How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?"
12262,L60389,u419,m25,RONALD,Shadow.
12263,L60702,u420,m25,SHADOW,"I need that report, Lt."
12264,L60701,u421,m25,STEPHEN,It knows us. This one knows us.
12265,L60700,u420,m25,SHADOW,I might.
12266,L60699,u421,m25,STEPHEN,You don't know... nobody knows...
12267,L60698,u420,m25,SHADOW,"What do you listen to, Stephen?"
12268,L60697,u421,m25,STEPHEN,...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
12269,L60696,u420,m25,SHADOW,I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
12270,L60695,u421,m25,STEPHEN,I'm working on it.
12271,L60058,u421,m25,STEPHEN,The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
12272,L60057,u420,m25,SHADOW,Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
12273,L60056,u421,m25,STEPHEN,Got a cause?
12274,L60898,u420,m25,SHADOW,This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --

12278,L60663,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,Just catch the son of a bitch.
12279,L60662,u420,m25,SHADOW,"Is there a connection between them, Alderman?"
12280,L60661,u420,m25,SHADOW,Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
12281,L60660,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,"Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!"
12282,L60659,u420,m25,SHADOW,We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
12283,L60658,u420,m25,SHADOW,"No Marty, I don't."
12284,L60657,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,Don't you have any leads at all?

12287,L60653,u420,m25,SHADOW,Alderman.
12288,L60652,u422,m25,SWAYZAK,Inspector.

That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --"

Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would."

Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?"

12413,L61863,u433,m26,NUN,"Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys."
12414,L61862,u433,m26,NUN,"Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina."
12415,L61861,u434,m26,PRIEST,"Yes, Sister?"
12416,L61860,u433,m26,NUN,"As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --"
12417,L61859,u434,m26,PRIEST,"I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer."
12418,L61858,u433,m26,NUN,"I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?"
12419,L61857,u434,m26,PRIEST,"It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt."
12420,L61856,u433,m26,NUN,"Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?"
12421,L61855,u434,m26,PRIEST,"Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --"
12422,L61854,u433,m26,NUN,"Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil."

12458,L62743,u452,m27,SLOAN,What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
12459,L62742,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,"Yeah, him."
12460,L62741,u452,m27,SLOAN,Delacroix.
12461,L62740,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
12462,L62739,u452,m27,SLOAN,Please.
12463,L62738,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,"We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A."
12464,L62737,u452,m27,SLOAN,Who are you revolting against?
12465,L62736,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,"So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo."
12466,L62735,u452,m27,SLOAN,"Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?"
12467,L62734,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
12468,L62733,u452,m27,SLOAN,I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
12469,L62732,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,"Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece."
12470,L62731,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
12471,L62730,u452,m27,SLOAN,I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
12472,L62729,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,"Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is..."
12473,L62728,u452,m27,SLOAN,"I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius."
12474,L62727,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,Give me some?
12475,L62726,u452,m27,SLOAN,Well you did.
12476,L62725,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,I didn't mean to scare you like that.
12477,L62724,u452,m27,SLOAN,You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
12478,L62979,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
12479,L62978,u439,m27,DELACROIX,We're ready when you are.
12480,L62977,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,"We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science."
12481,L62976,u439,m27,DELACROIX,And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
12482,L62975,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
12483,L62974,u439,m27,DELACROIX,What's your name?
12484,L62973,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,"The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's."
12485,L63481,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,"Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats."
12486,L63480,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,"And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better..."
12487,L63476,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,I'm a revolutionary.
12488,L63475,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,What do you do?
12489,L63474,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,What do I do?
12490,L63473,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,"And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?"
12491,L63468,u437,m27,BIG BLACK,"Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout."
12492,L63467,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
12493,L63431,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit."
12494,L63430,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent."
12495,L63429,u438,m27,CHEEBA,You can walk away.  We both can.
12496,L63428,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players."
12497,L63427,u438,m27,CHEEBA,You're in this up till ya neck.
12498,L63426,u447,m27,MANTAN,Damn skippy.
12499,L63425,u438,m27,CHEEBA,So that's what you been doing?
12500,L63424,u447,m27,MANTAN,Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
12501,L63423,u438,m27,CHEEBA,I'm out.
12502,L63422,u447,m27,MANTAN,Meaning?
12503,L63421,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid."
12504,L63420,u447,m27,MANTAN,What are you talkin' about?
12505,L63419,u438,m27,CHEEBA,I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
12506,L63254,u438,m27,CHEEBA,Look at my lips.
12507,L63253,u447,m27,MANTAN,Why they gotta make my nose so big?
12508,L62898,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"In fact, we never knew she had any friends period."
12509,L62897,u447,m27,MANTAN,Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
12510,L62896,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"Please, have a seat."
12511,L62891,u447,m27,MANTAN,Must be the pressure.
12512,L62890,u438,m27,CHEEBA,What's wrong with him?
12513,L62881,u447,m27,MANTAN,You ain't happy about the green light?
12514,L62880,u438,m27,CHEEBA,DeLa - what's the matter with you.
12515,L62833,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you."
12516,L62832,u447,m27,MANTAN,You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
12517,L62831,u438,m27,CHEEBA,Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
12518,L62830,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Seconds and thirds, too."
12519,L62829,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE."
12520,L62828,u447,m27,MANTAN,What's that?
12521,L62827,u438,m27,CHEEBA,She's also moorish.
12522,L62826,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Certified ladies' man, huh?"
12523,L62825,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit."
12524,L62824,u447,m27,MANTAN,"It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face."
12525,L62823,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins."
12526,L62822,u447,m27,MANTAN,I'm not smiling.
12527,L62821,u438,m27,CHEEBA,Why are you smiling so?
12528,L62820,u447,m27,MANTAN,You might be right.
12529,L62819,u438,m27,CHEEBA,Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
12530,L62845,u439,m27,DELACROIX,That can be done.
12531,L62844,u438,m27,CHEEBA,We might need some mo' money behind this.
12532,L62843,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one."
12533,L62757,u439,m27,DELACROIX,And this is Manray.
12534,L62756,u438,m27,CHEEBA,Nice to meet you.
12535,L62701,u439,m27,DELACROIX,You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
12536,L62700,u438,m27,CHEEBA,What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
12537,L62695,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Different.
12538,L62694,u438,m27,CHEEBA,What kind of show is this gonna be?
12539,L62690,u439,m27,DELACROIX,First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
12540,L62689,u438,m27,CHEEBA,How much?
12541,L62688,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money."
12542,L62682,u438,m27,CHEEBA,Manray needs a job.
12543,L62681,u439,m27,DELACROIX,No offense.
12544,L62680,u438,m27,CHEEBA,You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
12545,L62679,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
12546,L62562,u438,m27,CHEEBA,Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
12547,L62561,u439,m27,DELACROIX,De-la-croix.
12548,L62560,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot."
12549,L62559,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Good morning, Cheeba."
12550,L62842,u446,m27,MANRAY,"DeLa, I don't know 'bout this."
12551,L62841,u438,m27,CHEEBA,That ain't funny.
12552,L62686,u438,m27,CHEEBA,We're starving.
12553,L62685,u446,m27,MANRAY,If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
12554,L62684,u438,m27,CHEEBA,We was coming to see you.
12555,L62683,u446,m27,MANRAY,We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
12556,L62646,u438,m27,CHEEBA,Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
12557,L62645,u446,m27,MANRAY,We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
12558,L62629,u446,m27,MANRAY,I'm tired of waiting.
12559,L62628,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing."
12560,L62627,u446,m27,MANRAY,And I'm the feet.
12561,L62626,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit."
12562,L62625,u446,m27,MANRAY,"Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me."
12563,L62624,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"Ahh, the luxuries of life."
12564,L62622,u438,m27,CHEEBA,Did we get our bill yet?
12565,L62621,u446,m27,MANRAY,"Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO."
12566,L62620,u438,m27,CHEEBA,"My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon."
12567,L62619,u446,m27,MANRAY,I'm starvin' like Marvin.
12568,L63568,u439,m27,DELACROIX,No costume.  No blackface.
12569,L63567,u446,m27,MANRAY,I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
12570,L63566,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional."
12571,L63565,u446,m27,MANRAY,I won't do it anymore.
12572,L63564,u439,m27,DELACROIX,How you sound?
12573,L63563,u446,m27,MANRAY,I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
12574,L62847,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Mantan!!
12575,L62846,u446,m27,MANRAY,Mantan?
12576,L62836,u439,m27,DELACROIX,You have to start getting into your character.
12577,L62835,u446,m27,MANRAY,Why?
12578,L62834,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
12579,L62706,u446,m27,MANRAY,"Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks."
12580,L62705,u439,m27,DELACROIX,You're now Mantan.
12581,L62704,u446,m27,MANRAY,To what?
12582,L62703,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I would like to change your name.
12583,L62699,u439,m27,DELACROIX,That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
12584,L62698,u446,m27,MANRAY,"DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!"
12585,L62697,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other."
12586,L62696,u446,m27,MANRAY,How different?
12587,L62693,u446,m27,MANRAY,Where do I sign?
12588,L62692,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Some tap dancing, some singing."
12589,L62691,u446,m27,MANRAY,What do I have to do?
12590,L62637,u439,m27,DELACROIX,EUREKA!!
12591,L62636,u446,m27,MANRAY,My tap shoes.
12592,L62566,u446,m27,MANRAY,Well do something about it.
12593,L62565,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street."
12594,L63326,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon."
12595,L63325,u442,m27,GARY BYRD,Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
12596,L63324,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up."
12597,L63323,u442,m27,GARY BYRD,But the line has to be drawn.
12598,L63322,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
12599,L63321,u442,m27,GARY BYRD,No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
12600,L63320,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored."
12601,L63319,u442,m27,GARY BYRD,"Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?"
12602,L63097,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice."
12603,L63096,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I gots to go, it's my Moms."
12604,L63095,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call."
12605,L63094,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Hold on a sec, I got a call."
12606,L63093,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street."
12607,L63092,u439,m27,DELACROIX,This has to be a big mistake.
12608,L63091,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together."
12609,L63090,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?"
12610,L63023,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings."
12611,L63022,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut."
12612,L63021,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
12613,L63020,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from."
12614,L63018,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Calm down, please."
12615,L63017,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
12616,L62997,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Dunwitty, don't leave."
12617,L62996,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
12618,L62935,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much."
12619,L62934,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!"
12620,L62933,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that."
12621,L62932,u439,m27,DELACROIX,That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
12622,L62931,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"If Spielburg can direct ""The Color Purple"" and ""Amistad"", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot."
12623,L62930,u439,m27,DELACROIX,What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
12624,L62929,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless."
12625,L62928,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Besides, what does he know about Negroes?"
12626,L62927,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
12627,L62926,u439,m27,DELACROIX,You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
12628,L62925,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video."
12629,L62924,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after."
12630,L62923,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job."
12631,L62922,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing ""Amos and Andy.""  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain."
12632,L62812,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?"
12633,L62811,u439,m27,DELACROIX,We think so.
12634,L62810,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
12635,L62800,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
12636,L62799,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I don't know about that plantation angle.
12637,L62798,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive."
12638,L62797,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama."
12639,L62796,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's ""The PJ's."""
12640,L62795,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
12641,L62794,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima."
12642,L62793,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Who are the other characters?
12643,L62792,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
12644,L62791,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
12645,L62790,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Negroes would be in an uproar.
12646,L62789,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
12647,L62788,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Protest finally forced ""Amos and Andy"" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on."
12648,L62787,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"This could be bigger than ""Amos and Andy."""
12649,L62786,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Yep, you guessed it."
12650,L62785,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
12651,L62784,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
12652,L62783,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Exactly!
12653,L62782,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky."
12654,L62781,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,What are there character traits?
12655,L62780,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
12656,L62779,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
12657,L62778,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
12658,L62777,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,That's a great handle.
12659,L62774,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?"
12660,L62773,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
12661,L62772,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?"
12662,L62771,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial."
12663,L62770,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,I'm feelin' dis'!
12664,L62769,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister."
12665,L62768,u439,m27,DELACROIX,It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
12666,L62767,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,The name of the show?
12667,L62766,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium."
12668,L62765,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Word!!!
12669,L62764,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?"
12670,L62763,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Go on.  Good so far.
12671,L62762,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing."
12672,L62761,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,I'm wid it.
12673,L62760,u439,m27,DELACROIX,We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
12674,L62753,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan."
12675,L62752,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right."
12676,L62618,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you."
12677,L62617,u439,m27,DELACROIX,What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
12678,L62616,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
12679,L62615,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
12680,L62614,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know ""niggers"" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water."
12681,L62613,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some ""nigger"" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?"
12682,L62612,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white."
12683,L62611,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I've never been given a fair shot.
12684,L62610,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk."
12685,L62609,u439,m27,DELACROIX,...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
12686,L62608,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic..."
12687,L62607,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,I'm telling you it's not.
12688,L62606,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom."
12689,L62605,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again."
12690,L62602,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
12691,L62601,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
12692,L62600,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know ""niggers"" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I."
12693,L62599,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
12694,L62598,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed."
12695,L62597,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
12696,L62595,u439,m27,DELACROIX,C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
12697,L62594,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Do you know what C.P. Time is?
12698,L62578,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
12699,L62577,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
12700,L62576,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Four minutes ago.
12701,L62575,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
12702,L62574,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
12703,L62573,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,I'm sorry I'm late.
12704,L62572,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
12705,L63170,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,Always keep 'em laughing.
12706,L63169,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I love you too, Daddy."
12707,L63168,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble."
12708,L63167,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Let's get him over to the bed.
12709,L63164,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?"
12710,L63163,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I didn't mean that, in life."
12711,L63162,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"Three nights Charleston, South Carolina."
12712,L63161,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Where do you go from here?
12713,L63160,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle."
12714,L63159,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Nuthin' I can't handle.
12715,L63158,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
12716,L63157,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through."
12717,L63156,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"Enough about me, what's happening with you?"
12718,L63155,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the ""life's too short"" category."
12719,L63154,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
12720,L63153,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic."
12721,L63152,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors."
12722,L63151,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
12723,L63150,u439,m27,DELACROIX,That's what I'm askin'.
12724,L63149,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?"
12725,L63148,u439,m27,DELACROIX,How did you end up here?
12726,L63147,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
12727,L63146,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
12728,L63145,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,Purely for medicinal purposes.
12729,L63144,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic."
12730,L63143,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Daddy, she's younger than me."
12731,L63142,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,Good woman.  I trained her right.
12732,L63137,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Pleased to meet you.
12733,L63136,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT."
12734,L63135,u439,m27,DELACROIX,It's been a long time.
12735,L63134,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
12736,L63133,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"It's me, Peerless."
12737,L63132,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,"Go away, unless you got my money."
12738,L63131,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I want to speak with you.
12739,L63130,u445,m27,JUNEBUG,What do you want?
12740,L63180,u440,m27,DOT,"He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you."
12741,L63179,u439,m27,DELACROIX,He never showed it.
12742,L63178,u440,m27,DOT,Your father is proud of you.
12743,L63177,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
12744,L63176,u440,m27,DOT,"I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since."
12745,L63175,u439,m27,DELACROIX,So what's up with you?
12746,L63174,u440,m27,DOT,"The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it."
12747,L63173,u439,m27,DELACROIX,So he drank himself into a stuper?
12748,L63172,u440,m27,DOT,Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
12749,L63171,u439,m27,DELACROIX,How long has my father been like this?
12750,L63139,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Is that so?
12751,L63138,u440,m27,DOT,"Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about."
12752,L63659,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Give me the gun.
12753,L63658,u452,m27,SLOAN,I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
12754,L63655,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
12755,L63654,u452,m27,SLOAN,Don't make me have to use this.
12756,L63504,u439,m27,DELACROIX,And that's how you got me in the first place.
12757,L63503,u452,m27,SLOAN,"DeLa, kiss my big black ass."
12758,L63502,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU."
12759,L63501,u452,m27,SLOAN,Work related or otherwise?
12760,L63500,u439,m27,DELACROIX,The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
12761,L63499,u452,m27,SLOAN,"That was a mistake, but I don't regret it."
12762,L63498,u452,m27,SLOAN,That's why it will be so much fun.
12763,L63497,u439,m27,DELACROIX,This is crazy.
12764,L63496,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you."
12765,L63495,u452,m27,SLOAN,That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
12766,L63494,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Light?
12767,L63493,u452,m27,SLOAN,"DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light."
12768,L63492,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Do you have to be so damn forthright?
12769,L63491,u452,m27,SLOAN,"I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think."
12770,L63490,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up."
12771,L63489,u452,m27,SLOAN,Please don't go there.
12772,L63488,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?"
12773,L63487,u452,m27,SLOAN,He's just playing big brother.
12774,L63486,u439,m27,DELACROIX,That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
12775,L63485,u452,m27,SLOAN,You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
12776,L63484,u439,m27,DELACROIX,How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
12777,L63483,u452,m27,SLOAN,I don't want to hear it.
12778,L63482,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Why'd you do that?
12779,L63318,u452,m27,SLOAN,"To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human."
12780,L63317,u439,m27,DELACROIX,How so?
12781,L63316,u452,m27,SLOAN,"It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles."
12782,L63315,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Is that good or bad?
12783,L63314,u452,m27,SLOAN,I thought it was appropiate.
12784,L63313,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Thanks.
12785,L63312,u452,m27,SLOAN,"This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century."
12786,L63311,u439,m27,DELACROIX,The Jolly Nigger Bank.
12787,L63307,u452,m27,SLOAN,"No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it."
12788,L63306,u439,m27,DELACROIX,For what?
12789,L63305,u452,m27,SLOAN,A gift.
12790,L63304,u439,m27,DELACROIX,What is this?
12791,L63303,u439,m27,DELACROIX,A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
12792,L63302,u452,m27,SLOAN,"So you have your small victory, now what?"
12793,L63251,u452,m27,SLOAN,Everybody shut up.
12794,L63250,u439,m27,DELACROIX,What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
12795,L63247,u452,m27,SLOAN,"I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny."
12796,L63246,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Who's side are you on?
12797,L63060,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his."
12798,L63059,u452,m27,SLOAN,I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
12799,L63053,u452,m27,SLOAN,The pleasure is mine.
12800,L63052,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Same here.
12801,L63047,u452,m27,SLOAN,Just don't lie to me.
12802,L63046,u439,m27,DELACROIX,What do you want me to say?
12803,L63045,u452,m27,SLOAN,We both lied to him.
12804,L63044,u452,m27,SLOAN,Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
12805,L63043,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Your life will never be the same.
12806,L63025,u452,m27,SLOAN,Break a leg.
12807,L63024,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Just want to say good luck.
12808,L63015,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
12809,L63014,u452,m27,SLOAN,You've said that already.
12810,L62971,u452,m27,SLOAN,The big one.
12811,L62970,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Which one is your brother?
12812,L62969,u452,m27,SLOAN,This is the group I was telling you about.
12813,L62938,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired."
12814,L62937,u452,m27,SLOAN,Hello.
12815,L62936,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins."
12816,L62920,u452,m27,SLOAN,"Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it."
12817,L62919,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
12818,L62918,u452,m27,SLOAN,What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
12819,L62917,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous."
12820,L62913,u452,m27,SLOAN,Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
12821,L62912,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money."
12822,L62911,u452,m27,SLOAN,Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
12823,L62910,u439,m27,DELACROIX,My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
12824,L62909,u452,m27,SLOAN,What is your problem?
12825,L62879,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
12826,L62878,u452,m27,SLOAN,You okay?
12827,L62755,u439,m27,DELACROIX,This is Cheeba.
12828,L62754,u452,m27,SLOAN,Hello.
12829,L62667,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours."
12830,L62666,u452,m27,SLOAN,Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
12831,L62659,u439,m27,DELACROIX,And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
12832,L62658,u452,m27,SLOAN,Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
12833,L62657,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Good.  I'm going to need your support.
12834,L62656,u452,m27,SLOAN,I'm in till the end.
12835,L62655,u439,m27,DELACROIX,You getting cold feet?
12836,L62654,u452,m27,SLOAN,Sounds risky to me.
12837,L62653,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons."
12838,L62652,u452,m27,SLOAN,What point is that?
12839,L62651,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point."
12840,L62650,u452,m27,SLOAN,You lost me.
12841,L62649,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Not yet, but this thing will never get made."
12842,L62648,u452,m27,SLOAN,Do you know how you will use him?
12843,L62647,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Manray was under our nose the whole time.
12844,L62644,u452,m27,SLOAN,The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
12845,L62643,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary."
12846,L62642,u452,m27,SLOAN,It hit me like a ton of bricks.
12847,L62641,u439,m27,DELACROIX,How did you know?
12848,L62640,u452,m27,SLOAN,Manray!
12849,L62639,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Manray!
12850,L62593,u452,m27,SLOAN,"It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known."
12851,L62592,u439,m27,DELACROIX,What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
12852,L62591,u452,m27,SLOAN,Nobody told me anything.
12853,L62590,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
12854,L62589,u452,m27,SLOAN,How was it?
12855,L62951,u448,m27,MONA,"I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's ""LAUGH-IN."""
12856,L62950,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud."
12857,L62949,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work."
12858,L62944,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Oh, is that what I'm doing?"
12859,L62943,u448,m27,MONA,I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
12860,L62942,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Hi, Mona."
12861,L62941,u448,m27,MONA,"He, I'm Mona."
12862,L62940,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Yes, your name?"
12863,L63562,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up."
12864,L63561,u447,m27,MANTAN,"My name is Manray, goddamnit."
12865,L63560,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Mantan, we got a show to tape."
12866,L63512,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself."
12867,L63511,u447,m27,MANTAN,I don't believe it.
12868,L63510,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity."
12869,L63509,u447,m27,MANTAN,Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
12870,L63508,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired."
12871,L63507,u447,m27,MANTAN,What you did is dead wrong.
12872,L63506,u439,m27,DELACROIX,You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
12873,L63453,u439,m27,DELACROIX,And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
12874,L63452,u447,m27,MANTAN,Yeah.
12875,L63451,u439,m27,DELACROIX,You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
12876,L63450,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece."
12877,L63449,u439,m27,DELACROIX,You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
12878,L63448,u447,m27,MANTAN,No.
12879,L63447,u439,m27,DELACROIX,What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
12880,L63350,u439,m27,DELACROIX,In time.
12881,L63349,u447,m27,MANTAN,Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
12882,L63348,u439,m27,DELACROIX,No joke.  Serious.
12883,L63345,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity."
12884,L63344,u447,m27,MANTAN,Same thing Giuliani said.
12885,L63343,u439,m27,DELACROIX,This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
12886,L63342,u447,m27,MANTAN,You sound like the media.
12887,L63341,u439,m27,DELACROIX,So they can be on TV.
12888,L63032,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready."
12889,L63031,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Not nervous?  Relaxed?
12890,L63030,u447,m27,MANTAN,I feel fine.
12891,L63029,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"You feel good, not nervous?"
12892,L63028,u447,m27,MANTAN,Naw.  I'll take the zero.
12893,L63027,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Can I kiss you too?
12894,L62889,u447,m27,MANTAN,The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
12895,L62888,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you."
12896,L62887,u447,m27,MANTAN,"That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?"
12897,L62886,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I didn't mean it to sound like that.
12898,L62885,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure."
12899,L62884,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
12900,L63545,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Soon.
12901,L63544,u450,m27,ORCHID,I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
12902,L63543,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan."
12903,L63542,u450,m27,ORCHID,You know how your Daddy is.
12904,L63541,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Not at all?
12905,L63540,u450,m27,ORCHID,No.
12906,L63539,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?"
12907,L63538,u450,m27,ORCHID,Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
12908,L63537,u439,m27,DELACROIX,You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
12909,L63536,u450,m27,ORCHID,"I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery."
12910,L63118,u450,m27,ORCHID,"Peerless, last time, go see your father."
12911,L63117,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present."
12912,L63116,u450,m27,ORCHID,Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
12913,L63115,u439,m27,DELACROIX,It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
12914,L63114,u450,m27,ORCHID,"Regardless, he still is your father."
12915,L63113,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
12916,L63112,u450,m27,ORCHID,Richmond is not all the way down south.
12917,L63111,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I can't go all the way down south.
12918,L63110,u450,m27,ORCHID,"He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia."
12919,L63109,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Where is he?
12920,L63108,u450,m27,ORCHID,Yes he did.
12921,L63107,u439,m27,DELACROIX,He said that?
12922,L63106,u450,m27,ORCHID,He wants you to come and see him.
12923,L63099,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I'll be right over.
12924,L63098,u450,m27,ORCHID,"Peerless, your father called."
12925,L62877,u450,m27,ORCHID,I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
12926,L62876,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something."
12927,L62875,u450,m27,ORCHID,"Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already."
12928,L62874,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?"
12929,L62873,u450,m27,ORCHID,I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
12930,L62872,u439,m27,DELACROIX,I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
12931,L62871,u450,m27,ORCHID,"Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate."
12932,L62870,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Mommy, please don't call me that."
12933,L62869,u450,m27,ORCHID,"If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless."
12934,L62868,u439,m27,DELACROIX,It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
12935,L62867,u450,m27,ORCHID,"That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?"
12936,L62866,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot."
12937,L62865,u450,m27,ORCHID,How's the food?
12938,L62864,u450,m27,ORCHID,I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
12939,L62863,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff."
12940,L62862,u450,m27,ORCHID,You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
12941,L62861,u439,m27,DELACROIX,It looks delicious.
12942,L62860,u450,m27,ORCHID,You must think I'm some kind of fool.
12943,L63049,u444,m27,JUKKA,Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
12944,L63048,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show."
12945,L63013,u439,m27,DELACROIX,This is a travesty.  A debacle.
12946,L63012,u444,m27,JUKKA,"Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?"
12947,L63011,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"This is a TV show, not a music video."
12948,L63010,u444,m27,JUKKA,"My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?"
12949,L63009,u439,m27,DELACROIX,How did you get this gig?
12950,L63008,u444,m27,JUKKA,Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
12951,L63007,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO."
12952,L63006,u444,m27,JUKKA,Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
12953,L63005,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
12954,L63004,u439,m27,DELACROIX,A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
12955,L63003,u444,m27,JUKKA,What's a Negro.
12956,L63002,u439,m27,DELACROIX,"Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?"
12957,L63001,u444,m27,JUKKA,"You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?"
12958,L63000,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Finland.
12959,L62999,u444,m27,JUKKA,"Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland."
12960,L62998,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Where are you from?
12961,L62995,u444,m27,JUKKA,I just turned twenty.
12962,L62994,u439,m27,DELACROIX,Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
12963,L63300,u449,m27,MYRNA,"This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black."
12964,L63299,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Yes you!
12965,L63295,u449,m27,MYRNA,Thank you.  And always smile.
12966,L63294,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Let Myrna finish.
12967,L63289,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing."
12968,L63288,u449,m27,MYRNA,"The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, ""F"" 'em."
12969,L63282,u449,m27,MYRNA,The best defense is offense.
12970,L63281,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
12971,L63278,u449,m27,MYRNA,"First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King."
12972,L63277,u441,m27,DUNWITTY,"I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz."
12973,L62722,u452,m27,SLOAN,I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
12974,L62721,u446,m27,MANRAY,"I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world."
12975,L62720,u452,m27,SLOAN,Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
12976,L62719,u446,m27,MANRAY,You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
12977,L62718,u452,m27,SLOAN,"If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you."
12978,L62717,u446,m27,MANRAY,I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
12979,L62716,u452,m27,SLOAN,"No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant."
12980,L62715,u446,m27,MANRAY,Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
12981,L62714,u452,m27,SLOAN,What do you mean?
12982,L62713,u446,m27,MANRAY,So what's up with you and DeLa?
12983,L62712,u452,m27,SLOAN,A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
12984,L62711,u446,m27,MANRAY,You sing and dance?
12985,L62710,u452,m27,SLOAN,I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
12986,L62709,u446,m27,MANRAY,"Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself."
12987,L62708,u452,m27,SLOAN,"You've never had any formal training, either?"
12988,L62707,u446,m27,MANRAY,I never had a really real pair before.
12989,L63466,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,"I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS."
12990,L63465,u447,m27,MANTAN,"I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time."
12991,L63464,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
12992,L63463,u447,m27,MANTAN,"No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better."
12993,L63462,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
12994,L63461,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game."
12995,L63460,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,Money and nothing else?
12996,L63459,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, ""it's all about the Benjamins."""
12997,L63458,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,"Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?"
12998,L63457,u447,m27,MANTAN,I'm more comfortable around my people.
12999,L63456,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,"Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here."
13000,L63455,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Tavis, thank you for having me."
13001,L63454,u453,m27,TAVIS SMILEY,"Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in."
13002,L63399,u451,m27,SLEEP 'N EAT,A song a comin' I feel.
13003,L63398,u447,m27,MANTAN,I feel a song a comin' on.

13005,L63395,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather."
13006,L63394,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother."
13007,L63393,u451,m27,SLEEP 'N EAT,"Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle."
13008,L63392,u447,m27,MANTAN,I don't know who I am.
13009,L63391,u451,m27,SLEEP 'N EAT,How be dat?
13010,L63390,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately."
13011,L63389,u451,m27,SLEEP 'N EAT,Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
13012,L63388,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me."
13013,L63387,u451,m27,SLEEP 'N EAT,"Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?"
13014,L63386,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?"
13015,L63385,u451,m27,SLEEP 'N EAT,You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
13016,L63384,u447,m27,MANTAN,I slept too near where I fell out.
13017,L63383,u451,m27,SLEEP 'N EAT,You slept too near where you got in?
13018,L63382,u447,m27,MANTAN,I fell out of my bed last night.

Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.

13072,L63529,u447,m27,MANTAN,Don't try to change to the subject.
13073,L63528,u452,m27,SLOAN,"Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?"
13074,L63527,u447,m27,MANTAN,"So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like ""IHOP.""  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass."
13075,L63526,u452,m27,SLOAN,That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
13076,L63525,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Aw, c'mon."
13077,L63524,u452,m27,SLOAN,"We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned."
13078,L63523,u447,m27,MANTAN,Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
13079,L63522,u452,m27,SLOAN,"Say what, Manray?"

13084,L63517,u447,m27,MANTAN,And?
13085,L63516,u452,m27,SLOAN,"After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant."
13086,L63515,u447,m27,MANTAN,You leave something out?
13087,L63514,u452,m27,SLOAN,"Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position."
13088,L63513,u447,m27,MANTAN,How did you get this gig?
13089,L63441,u447,m27,MANTAN,You look beautiful like that.
13090,L63440,u452,m27,SLOAN,What?

13095,L63434,u447,m27,MANTAN,For what?  He left.  Not me.
13096,L63433,u452,m27,SLOAN,Why don't you call him?
13097,L63380,u447,m27,MANTAN,We can look out for ourselves.
13098,L63379,u452,m27,SLOAN,I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
13099,L63378,u447,m27,MANTAN,Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
13100,L63377,u452,m27,SLOAN,"Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?"
13101,L63376,u447,m27,MANTAN,Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
13102,L63375,u452,m27,SLOAN,Maybe you need to start.
13103,L63374,u447,m27,MANTAN,Never read a book in my whole life.
13104,L63373,u452,m27,SLOAN,"You don't read, do you?"
13105,L63372,u447,m27,MANTAN,"No, before my time."
13106,L63371,u452,m27,SLOAN,"Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist."
13107,L63370,u447,m27,MANTAN,Gots no intention of ending up broke.
13108,L63369,u452,m27,SLOAN,I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
13109,L63368,u447,m27,MANTAN,Just a little something' somethin'.
13110,L63367,u452,m27,SLOAN,"Oh you do, huh?"
13111,L63366,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Sloan, I got it like 'dat."
13112,L63365,u452,m27,SLOAN,This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
13113,L63105,u452,m27,SLOAN,Are you trying to rap to me?
13114,L63104,u447,m27,MANTAN,What else?
13115,L63103,u452,m27,SLOAN,I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
13116,L63102,u447,m27,MANTAN,The good stuff.
13117,L63101,u452,m27,SLOAN,What do you want to know?
13118,L63100,u447,m27,MANTAN,So what's up with you?
13119,L62904,u452,m27,SLOAN,Enough.
13120,L62903,u447,m27,MANTAN,A lot?
13121,L62883,u447,m27,MANTAN,"Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral."
13122,L62882,u452,m27,SLOAN,People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
13123,L64606,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again."
13124,L64605,u454,m28,ARMED GENTLEMAN,Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
13125,L64604,u473,m28,RODERICK,That is none of your business.
13126,L64603,u454,m28,ARMED GENTLEMAN,Where are you bound for?
13127,L64602,u473,m28,RODERICK,Good morning.
13128,L64601,u454,m28,ARMED GENTLEMAN,"Good day to you, young sir."
13129,L64575,u463,m28,HARRY,"Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire."
13130,L64574,u455,m28,CAPTAIN BEST,"Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?"
13131,L64573,u463,m28,HARRY,"There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?"
13132,L64530,u463,m28,HARRY,"You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that."
13133,L64529,u455,m28,CAPTAIN BEST,"I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I."
13134,L64528,u463,m28,HARRY,Both of us ride home with Best here.
13135,L64524,u463,m28,HARRY,"If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best."
13136,L64523,u455,m28,CAPTAIN BEST,"And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --"
13137,L64501,u455,m28,CAPTAIN BEST,I never was more in earnest.
13138,L64500,u466,m28,MICHAEL,"Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking."
13139,L64499,u455,m28,CAPTAIN BEST,"It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir."
13140,L64498,u466,m28,MICHAEL,"Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones."
13141,L64497,u455,m28,CAPTAIN BEST,"I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir."
13142,L64496,u466,m28,MICHAEL,"Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?"
13143,L64828,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago."
13144,L64827,u473,m28,RODERICK,And his baggage?
13145,L64826,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on."
13146,L64823,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Not yet, but I believe he intends to."
13147,L64822,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,Has he sent the challenge yet?
13148,L64808,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it."
13149,L64807,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,What are the Chevalier's intentions?
13150,L64769,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys."
13151,L64768,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Only a very little, as soldiers do."
13152,L64767,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?"
13153,L64764,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet."
13154,L64763,u473,m28,RODERICK,"What is the service, sir?"
13155,L64762,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas."
13156,L64761,u473,m28,RODERICK,"The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion."
13157,L64760,u473,m28,RODERICK,"How do you do, sir?"
13158,L64759,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein."
13159,L64742,u473,m28,RODERICK,Neither!
13160,L64741,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?"
13161,L64740,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Sir, I'm a British officer."
13162,L64739,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,I have acted as I think fit.
13163,L64738,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly."
13164,L64737,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile."
13165,L64736,u473,m28,RODERICK,Where's the beauty you promised me?
13166,L64733,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers."
13167,L64732,u473,m28,RODERICK,The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
13168,L64731,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you."
13169,L64730,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
13170,L64729,u473,m28,RODERICK,"This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach."
13171,L64728,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
13172,L64726,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,"Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady..."
13173,L64725,u473,m28,RODERICK,O'Grady.
13174,L64724,u456,m28,CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN,What is your uncle's name?
13175,L64723,u473,m28,RODERICK,"My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him."
13176,L64692,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want."
13177,L64691,u473,m28,RODERICK,The coward!
13178,L64690,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made."
13179,L64689,u473,m28,RODERICK,Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
13180,L64688,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
13181,L64687,u473,m28,RODERICK,Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
13182,L64686,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
13183,L64685,u473,m28,RODERICK,Is Miss Dugan well?
13184,L64684,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
13185,L64683,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to ""Brown Bess."""
13186,L64682,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office."
13187,L64681,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin."
13188,L64680,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family."
13189,L64572,u473,m28,RODERICK,"A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize."
13190,L64571,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off."
13191,L64563,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,It must have been some other gate.
13192,L64562,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years."
13193,L64561,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now."
13194,L64560,u473,m28,RODERICK,I'll match any man with the sword.
13195,L64559,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword."
13196,L64558,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body."
13197,L64557,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality."
13198,L64556,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world."
13199,L64555,u473,m28,RODERICK,"It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize."
13200,L64554,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,That's a very handsome sword you have there.
13201,L64552,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,Your cousins go out with him.
13202,L64551,u473,m28,RODERICK,My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
13203,L64550,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
13204,L64549,u473,m28,RODERICK,Have you taken my message to him?
13205,L64540,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second."
13206,L64539,u473,m28,RODERICK,He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
13207,L64538,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow."
13208,L64537,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?"
13209,L64536,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?"
13210,L64535,u473,m28,RODERICK,And so I am.
13211,L64534,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father."
13212,L64510,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,"Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word."
13213,L64509,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!"
13214,L64506,u473,m28,RODERICK,The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
13215,L64505,u457,m28,CAPTAIN GROGAN,This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
13216,L64661,u458,m28,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,"Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud."
13217,L64660,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body."
13218,L64659,u458,m28,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,"You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!"
13219,L64658,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!"
13220,L64657,u458,m28,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,"Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?"
13221,L64639,u458,m28,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,I have heard of them.
13222,L64638,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown."
13223,L64637,u458,m28,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,"Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset."
13224,L64636,u473,m28,RODERICK,Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
13225,L64635,u458,m28,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,"Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?"
13226,L64634,u473,m28,RODERICK,I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
13227,L64633,u458,m28,CAPTAIN O'REILLY,"Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife."
13228,L64803,u471,m28,PRINCE,I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
13229,L64802,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,"Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation."
13230,L64801,u471,m28,PRINCE,"Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time."
13231,L64800,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,"Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won."
13232,L64799,u471,m28,PRINCE,I don't know.
13233,L64798,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,"I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?"
13234,L64797,u471,m28,PRINCE,"Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me."
13235,L64843,u472,m28,PRUSSIAN OFFICER,The gentleman has nothing contraband.
13236,L64842,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,I have no luggage.
13237,L64839,u472,m28,PRUSSIAN OFFICER,As you please.
13238,L64838,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,All Europe shall hear of this!
13239,L64837,u472,m28,PRUSSIAN OFFICER,Your honor must lower his voice.
13240,L64836,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
13241,L64835,u472,m28,PRUSSIAN OFFICER,"I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not."
13242,L64834,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
13243,L64833,u472,m28,PRUSSIAN OFFICER,You are going to drive to the frontier.
13244,L64832,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,Good gracious!  What is this?
13245,L64831,u472,m28,PRUSSIAN OFFICER,I will let down the steps for your honor.
13246,L64830,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,"Where is my rascal, Lazlo?"
13247,L64912,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble."
13248,L64911,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,Certain?
13249,L64910,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him."
13250,L64909,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
13251,L64908,u473,m28,RODERICK,It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
13252,L64874,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,"Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you."
13253,L64873,u473,m28,RODERICK,"When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?"
13254,L64845,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier."
13255,L64844,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,"Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?"
13256,L64819,u473,m28,RODERICK,"But how, sir?"
13257,L64818,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,"Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go."
13258,L64817,u473,m28,RODERICK,"But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?"
13259,L64816,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,I have faced that problem before.
13260,L64815,u473,m28,RODERICK,I believe they will deport you.
13261,L64814,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
13262,L64813,u473,m28,RODERICK,But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
13263,L64792,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,"We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing."
13264,L64791,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill."
13265,L64790,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,"The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?"
13266,L64788,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,"I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place."
13267,L64787,u473,m28,RODERICK,"And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood."
13268,L64781,u473,m28,RODERICK,Only the agency of servants.
13269,L64780,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,Who else can give me information about you?
13270,L64779,u473,m28,RODERICK,"No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins."
13271,L64778,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,For whom else have you worked?
13272,L64777,u473,m28,RODERICK,Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
13273,L64776,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
13274,L64775,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Yes, sir."
13275,L64774,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
13276,L64773,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Yes, sir.  Here is my letter."
13277,L64772,u459,m28,CHEVALIER,You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
13278,L64901,u460,m28,COUNT,"Take to your legs, low Irish dog."
13279,L64900,u473,m28,RODERICK,That is a trifle strong.
13280,L64899,u460,m28,COUNT,Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
13281,L64898,u473,m28,RODERICK,On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
13282,L64897,u460,m28,COUNT,Then you yield to me.
13283,L64896,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her."
13284,L64895,u460,m28,COUNT,"Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals."
13285,L64894,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?"
13286,L64893,u460,m28,COUNT,"I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady."
13287,L65194,u461,m28,COUNTESS,Old fool!
13288,L65193,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool."
13289,L65164,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me."
13290,L65163,u473,m28,RODERICK,"My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:"
13291,L64992,u473,m28,RODERICK,"We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  ""Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"""
13292,L64991,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much."
13293,L64990,u473,m28,RODERICK,Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
13294,L64989,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes."
13295,L64986,u473,m28,RODERICK,"O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!"
13296,L64985,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it."
13297,L64984,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty."
13298,L64983,u461,m28,COUNTESS,My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
13299,L64982,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew."
13300,L64981,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires."
13301,L64980,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away."
13302,L64979,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it."
13303,L64978,u473,m28,RODERICK,Will we always leave it at this?
13304,L64977,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet."
13305,L64976,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?"
13306,L64975,u473,m28,RODERICK,Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
13307,L64974,u461,m28,COUNTESS,You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
13308,L64973,u473,m28,RODERICK,Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
13309,L64972,u461,m28,COUNTESS,And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
13310,L64971,u473,m28,RODERICK,"With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight."
13311,L64970,u461,m28,COUNTESS,Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
13312,L64969,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer."
13313,L64968,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent."
13314,L64967,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me."
13315,L64966,u473,m28,RODERICK,To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
13316,L64965,u461,m28,COUNTESS,To make me wretched in two weeks.
13317,L64964,u473,m28,RODERICK,It is my only object.
13318,L64963,u461,m28,COUNTESS,You want my heart?
13319,L64962,u473,m28,RODERICK,"By loving you, with no hope of possessing you."
13320,L64961,u461,m28,COUNTESS,How so?
13321,L64960,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men."
13322,L64959,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws."
13323,L64958,u473,m28,RODERICK,I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
13324,L64957,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last."
13325,L64956,u473,m28,RODERICK,"That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love."
13326,L64955,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune."
13327,L64954,u473,m28,RODERICK,"It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love."
13328,L64953,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"Your word ""empty"" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it."
13329,L64952,u473,m28,RODERICK,Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
13330,L64951,u461,m28,COUNTESS,Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
13331,L64950,u473,m28,RODERICK,What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
13332,L64949,u461,m28,COUNTESS,"That man has, perhaps, not yet been born."
13333,L64948,u473,m28,RODERICK,Have you not a man whom you value?
13334,L64947,u461,m28,COUNTESS,Not one.
13335,L64946,u473,m28,RODERICK,How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
13336,L64945,u461,m28,COUNTESS,Not even that.
13337,L64944,u473,m28,RODERICK,"But, for a time... a passing fancy?"
13338,L64943,u461,m28,COUNTESS,Never.
13339,L64942,u473,m28,RODERICK,Have you had one?
13340,L64941,u461,m28,COUNTESS,No.
13341,L64494,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick."
13342,L64493,u462,m28,DOROTHY,"Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?"
13343,L64472,u462,m28,DOROTHY,"Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --"
13344,L64471,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us."
13345,L64470,u462,m28,DOROTHY,"What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?"
13346,L64469,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them."
13347,L64468,u462,m28,DOROTHY,"Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side."
13348,L64467,u462,m28,DOROTHY,"But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter."
13349,L64466,u473,m28,RODERICK,"If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is."
13350,L64465,u462,m28,DOROTHY,"Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world."
13351,L64464,u473,m28,RODERICK,"But you refused me, Dorothy."
13352,L64463,u462,m28,DOROTHY,"I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?"
13353,L64462,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?"
13354,L64461,u462,m28,DOROTHY,I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
13355,L64460,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night."
13356,L64452,u473,m28,RODERICK,With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
13357,L64451,u462,m28,DOROTHY,Why are you shaking?
13358,L64450,u462,m28,DOROTHY,Then you must get it.
13359,L64449,u473,m28,RODERICK,I feel the ribbon.
13360,L64446,u473,m28,RODERICK,Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
13361,L64445,u462,m28,DOROTHY,Agreed.
13362,L64444,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases."
13363,L65079,u473,m28,RODERICK,"All right, five hundred guineas."
13364,L65078,u464,m28,HENRI,"Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more."
13365,L65075,u473,m28,RODERICK,It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
13366,L65074,u464,m28,HENRI,"All the same, you must name an amount."
13367,L65073,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly."
13368,L65072,u464,m28,HENRI,As much as possible?
13369,L65071,u473,m28,RODERICK,As much as possible.
13370,L65070,u464,m28,HENRI,"I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?"
13371,L65103,u465,m28,LORD WEST,"Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you."
13372,L65102,u473,m28,RODERICK,Yes!
13373,L65101,u465,m28,LORD WEST,"Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?"
13374,L65048,u465,m28,LORD WEST,"Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get."
13375,L65047,u473,m28,RODERICK,By name only.
13376,L65046,u465,m28,LORD WEST,"Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?"
13377,L65045,u473,m28,RODERICK,"And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table."
13378,L64825,u473,m28,RODERICK,What is to be done?
13379,L64824,u467,m28,MINISTER GALGENSTEIN,Then this must be done tomorrow.
13380,L64821,u473,m28,RODERICK,When is he to go?
13381,L64820,u467,m28,MINISTER GALGENSTEIN,The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
13382,L64810,u473,m28,RODERICK,The Prince left him only that choice.
13383,L64809,u467,m28,MINISTER GALGENSTEIN,A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
13384,L64806,u467,m28,MINISTER GALGENSTEIN,Hmm-mmmm.
13385,L64805,u473,m28,RODERICK,In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
13386,L64804,u467,m28,MINISTER GALGENSTEIN,Was he cheated?
13387,L64771,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein."
13388,L64770,u467,m28,MINISTER GALGENSTEIN,Does this assignment interest you?
13389,L64629,u468,m28,MRS. O'REILLY,"You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver."
13390,L64628,u473,m28,RODERICK,"How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum."
13391,L64627,u468,m28,MRS. O'REILLY,"That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins."
13392,L64626,u473,m28,RODERICK,"As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?"
13393,L64625,u473,m28,RODERICK,O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
13394,L64624,u468,m28,MRS. O'REILLY,"But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?"
13395,L64623,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap."
13396,L64622,u468,m28,MRS. O'REILLY,"That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me."
13397,L64618,u468,m28,MRS. O'REILLY,"Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees..."
13398,L64617,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?"
13399,L64614,u468,m28,MRS. O'REILLY,"Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him ""good luck."""
13400,L64613,u473,m28,RODERICK,"What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?"
13401,L65179,u469,m28,NEWCOMBE,"When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here."
13402,L65178,u473,m28,RODERICK,I see.
13403,L65177,u469,m28,NEWCOMBE,"Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital."
13404,L65176,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Yes, of course."
13405,L65175,u469,m28,NEWCOMBE,May I be quite frank with you?
13406,L65174,u473,m28,RODERICK,Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
13407,L65173,u469,m28,NEWCOMBE,"There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature."
13408,L65172,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe."
13409,L65171,u469,m28,NEWCOMBE,"Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one."
13410,L65170,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed."
13411,L65169,u469,m28,NEWCOMBE,"I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance."
13412,L65146,u470,m28,PATRICK,"Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away."
13413,L65145,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Yes, he's fine."
13414,L65144,u470,m28,PATRICK,"Is he all right, papa?"
13415,L65143,u473,m28,RODERICK,Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
13416,L65133,u470,m28,PATRICK,"Yes, papa."
13417,L65132,u473,m28,RODERICK,I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
13418,L65127,u473,m28,RODERICK,"What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?"
13419,L65126,u470,m28,PATRICK,"One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?"
13420,L65125,u473,m28,RODERICK,Yes?
13421,L65124,u470,m28,PATRICK,Papa?
13422,L65123,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Good night, my little darling."
13423,L65122,u470,m28,PATRICK,"Good night, papa."
13424,L65120,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?"
13425,L65119,u470,m28,PATRICK,"But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?"
13426,L65118,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week."
13427,L65117,u470,m28,PATRICK,"Did you buy the horse, papa?"
13428,L65006,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,"I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?"
13429,L65005,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Sir, let those laugh that win."
13430,L65004,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,"Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting."
13431,L65003,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?"
13432,L65002,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,"Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?"
13433,L65001,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?"
13434,L65000,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
13435,L64999,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?"
13436,L64998,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,"Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?"
13437,L64997,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert."
13438,L64996,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,"Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool."
13439,L64995,u473,m28,RODERICK,I beg your pardon?
13440,L64994,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,"Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?"
13441,L64993,u473,m28,RODERICK,"Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account."
13442,L64936,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,"Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains."
13443,L64935,u473,m28,RODERICK,The milkmaid's daughter?
13444,L64934,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,"In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge."
13445,L64933,u473,m28,RODERICK,Would you have me spend my life all alone?
13446,L64932,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,"Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry."
13447,L64930,u474,m28,SIR WILLIAM,"Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own."
13448,L64929,u473,m28,RODERICK,"I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth."
13449,L64888,u473,m28,RODERICK,Tender Hegenheim.
13450,L64887,u475,m28,VALDEZ,"He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him."
13451,L64886,u473,m28,RODERICK,Will he wish to know the details of this night?
13452,L64885,u475,m28,VALDEZ,"He loves me, as I love you."
13453,L64884,u473,m28,RODERICK,"If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here."
13454,L64883,u475,m28,VALDEZ,He is only curious to know who you are.
13455,L64882,u473,m28,RODERICK,And he doesn't care about me?
13456,L64881,u475,m28,VALDEZ,"Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight."
13457,L64880,u473,m28,RODERICK,Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
13458,L64879,u473,m28,RODERICK,Dark Valdez.
13459,L64878,u473,m28,RODERICK,Black-eyed Sczortarska.
13460,L64877,u473,m28,RODERICK,Charming Schuvaloff.
13461,L66030,u479,m29,HARDY,Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
13462,L66029,u476,m29,BARTENDER,Who?
13463,L66028,u479,m29,HARDY,Bill Styles...
13464,L66025,u479,m29,HARDY,"Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going."
13465,L66024,u476,m29,BARTENDER,"Hurricane kept you up, too?"
13466,L66023,u479,m29,HARDY,"Don't you mean ""don't need no liquor license not taken away from me""?"
13467,L66022,u476,m29,BARTENDER,You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
13468,L66021,u479,m29,HARDY,"Yeah, if you've slept."
13469,L66020,u476,m29,BARTENDER,It's ten thirty in the morning.
13470,L66019,u479,m29,HARDY,Can I at least have a drink?
13471,L66018,u479,m29,HARDY,You know that was like a quadruple negative?
13472,L66017,u476,m29,BARTENDER,"Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me."
13473,L66621,u477,m29,CHILDS,"None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?"
13474,L66620,u480,m29,KENDALL,You framed-him...
13475,L66370,u480,m29,KENDALL,"Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --"
13476,L66369,u477,m29,CHILDS,He is the only one unaccounted for.
13477,L66344,u477,m29,CHILDS,"Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go."
13478,L66343,u480,m29,KENDALL,What about Pike?
13479,L66326,u477,m29,CHILDS,It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
13480,L66325,u480,m29,KENDALL,Did -- did you --
13481,L66322,u477,m29,CHILDS,Fine.
13482,L66321,u480,m29,KENDALL,I don't want to go --
13483,L66320,u477,m29,CHILDS,Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
13484,L66319,u480,m29,KENDALL,What do we do?
13485,L66318,u477,m29,CHILDS,"Fuck, what the fuck is going on --"
13486,L66306,u477,m29,CHILDS,"Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this."
13487,L66305,u480,m29,KENDALL,I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
13488,L66304,u477,m29,CHILDS,"A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?"
13489,L66300,u480,m29,KENDALL,I'm -- I'm sorry...
13490,L66299,u477,m29,CHILDS,Don't you ever point a gun at me!
13491,L66619,u477,m29,CHILDS,"Shut up, Mueller."
13492,L66618,u481,m29,MUELLER,"West was one thing, but this --"
13493,L66341,u477,m29,CHILDS,HEY!
13494,L66340,u481,m29,MUELLER,"Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP."
13495,L66338,u481,m29,MUELLER,I don't know!
13496,L66337,u477,m29,CHILDS,Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
13497,L66336,u481,m29,MUELLER,"We got -- I don't know, we got separated"
13498,L66332,u477,m29,CHILDS,We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
13499,L66331,u481,m29,MUELLER,You killed him you fucking faggot --
13500,L66330,u477,m29,CHILDS,We found him like this --
13501,L66329,u481,m29,MUELLER,"Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?"
13502,L66328,u481,m29,MUELLER,Can anybody hear me!
13503,L66327,u477,m29,CHILDS,This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
13504,L66617,u477,m29,CHILDS,"We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story."
13505,L66616,u478,m29,DUNBAR,You too?
13506,L66506,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Shut up.  West's dead.
13507,L66505,u477,m29,CHILDS,"Yeah, right..."
13508,L66484,u477,m29,CHILDS,We found him like this...
13509,L66483,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?"
13510,L66356,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"What do you mean, alone?"
13511,L66355,u477,m29,CHILDS,"What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --"
13512,L66351,u477,m29,CHILDS,We don't know. West is dead.
13513,L66350,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?"
13514,L67044,u479,m29,HARDY,He's telling the truth up to a point...
13515,L67043,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Washout rejects, guys he said were ""dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead""..."
13516,L67042,u479,m29,HARDY,I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
13517,L66918,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good."
13518,L66917,u479,m29,HARDY,And the bodies?
13519,L66916,u478,m29,DUNBAR,I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
13520,L66865,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
13521,L66864,u479,m29,HARDY,Do what?
13522,L66863,u478,m29,DUNBAR,He -- He made me do it --
13523,L66853,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Jesus!
13524,L66852,u479,m29,HARDY,"Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --"
13525,L66848,u479,m29,HARDY,We've found all of them.
13526,L66847,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?"
13527,L66846,u479,m29,HARDY,We don't need the tapes --
13528,L66824,u478,m29,DUNBAR,You wanna bet?
13529,L66823,u479,m29,HARDY,We're not finished yet --
13530,L66635,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die."
13531,L66634,u479,m29,HARDY,"Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --"
13532,L66629,u478,m29,DUNBAR,But not Pike's.
13533,L66628,u479,m29,HARDY,You saved Kendall's life --
13534,L66627,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession."
13535,L66626,u479,m29,HARDY,You shot Childs and Nunez.
13536,L66479,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Yeah --
13537,L66478,u479,m29,HARDY,And he'd been shot.
13538,L66475,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Of course --
13539,L66474,u479,m29,HARDY,You saw West's body.
13540,L66473,u478,m29,DUNBAR,I apologize --
13541,L66444,u479,m29,HARDY,"Yeah, we know, Pike did."
13542,L66443,u478,m29,DUNBAR,I didn't shoot West --
13543,L66442,u479,m29,HARDY,"So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --"
13544,L66437,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
13545,L66436,u479,m29,HARDY,"Fuck ""you're serious"", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it."
13546,L66435,u478,m29,DUNBAR,I'm serious --
13547,L66434,u479,m29,HARDY,"Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --"
13548,L66433,u478,m29,DUNBAR,He's lying.
13549,L66432,u479,m29,HARDY,That'd be my reaction too --
13550,L66431,u478,m29,DUNBAR,That son of a bitch.
13551,L66430,u479,m29,HARDY,"Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!"
13552,L66200,u479,m29,HARDY,"No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some."
13553,L66199,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more."
13554,L66198,u479,m29,HARDY,"You smoke, Ray?"
13555,L66197,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
13556,L66196,u479,m29,HARDY,And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
13557,L66149,u479,m29,HARDY,Tell me about them.
13558,L66148,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Some.
13559,L66147,u479,m29,HARDY,Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
13560,L66146,u478,m29,DUNBAR,I'm not telling you what happened.
13561,L66145,u479,m29,HARDY,"Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?"
13562,L66136,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Okay.
13563,L66135,u479,m29,HARDY,"Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?"
13564,L66129,u479,m29,HARDY,"They're dead, aren't they?"
13565,L66128,u478,m29,DUNBAR,There's no need...
13566,L66125,u479,m29,HARDY,"Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?"
13567,L66124,u478,m29,DUNBAR,You did Basic here?
13568,L66123,u479,m29,HARDY,"C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here."
13569,L66122,u478,m29,DUNBAR,I don't know... I like the Army.
13570,L66121,u479,m29,HARDY,What do you like then?
13571,L66120,u478,m29,DUNBAR,I just don't like it.
13572,L66119,u479,m29,HARDY,"Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty."
13573,L66118,u478,m29,DUNBAR,It's... too slow.
13574,L66117,u479,m29,HARDY,"You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?"
13575,L66116,u478,m29,DUNBAR,I asked for a policeman.
13576,L66115,u479,m29,HARDY,Why not?
13577,L66851,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing."
13578,L66850,u482,m29,OSBORNE,How do you know that?
13579,L66849,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Ohhhh, I don't think so..."
13580,L66844,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?"
13581,L66843,u482,m29,OSBORNE,We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
13582,L66842,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it."
13583,L66840,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Can't do that now, though, can you?"
13584,L66839,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too."
13585,L66633,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away."
13586,L66632,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Where's the cabin?
13587,L66631,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Would you have believed me?
13588,L66630,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
13589,L66493,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Yeah.
13590,L66492,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Mueller was alone in the cabin?
13591,L66491,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Back up.
13592,L66481,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --"
13593,L66480,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What about the phosphorous grenade?
13594,L66477,u478,m29,DUNBAR,The creek bed --
13595,L66476,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Where?
13596,L66441,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --"
13597,L66440,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What business?
13598,L66439,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?"
13599,L66438,u482,m29,OSBORNE,He said he worked there --
13600,L66195,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
13601,L66194,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Epilepsy.
13602,L66193,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?"
13603,L66187,u478,m29,DUNBAR,There were six of us...
13604,L66186,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out."
13605,L66185,u478,m29,DUNBAR,That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
13606,L66183,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class."
13607,L66182,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
13608,L67009,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Your weapons, Sergeant."
13609,L67008,u487,m29,WEST,What the fuck is going on?
13610,L66172,u487,m29,WEST,"The rest of you, fallout for physicals!"
13611,L66171,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Sir, yes, sir!"
13612,L66170,u487,m29,WEST,"Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?"
13613,L66169,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Sir, yes, sir!"
13614,L66168,u487,m29,WEST,"You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?"
13615,L66167,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Sir, Dunbar, sir!"
13616,L66166,u487,m29,WEST,"Cadet, what's your name!"
13617,L66614,u481,m29,MUELLER,I...
13618,L66613,u478,m29,DUNBAR,So you killed him?
13619,L66495,u478,m29,DUNBAR,So did we. Why didn't you come?
13620,L66494,u481,m29,MUELLER,Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
13621,L66490,u478,m29,DUNBAR,West... he's dead.
13622,L66489,u481,m29,MUELLER,"Jesus, what happened?"
13623,L66373,u478,m29,DUNBAR,We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
13624,L66372,u481,m29,MUELLER,Why?
13625,L66371,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
13626,L66365,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!"
13627,L66364,u481,m29,MUELLER,"Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --"
13628,L66363,u478,m29,DUNBAR,He wouldn't kill anybody...
13629,L66604,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Put it down!
13630,L66603,u483,m29,PIKE,A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
13631,L66575,u483,m29,PIKE,"We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now."
13632,L66574,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --"
13633,L66573,u483,m29,PIKE,"There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --"
13634,L66572,u478,m29,DUNBAR,This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
13635,L66571,u483,m29,PIKE,What don't you know?
13636,L66570,u478,m29,DUNBAR,I... I don't know...
13637,L66561,u483,m29,PIKE,Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
13638,L66560,u478,m29,DUNBAR,They?
13639,L66559,u483,m29,PIKE,"Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first..."
13640,L66557,u483,m29,PIKE,"That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing."
13641,L66556,u478,m29,DUNBAR,His chest was hamburger --
13642,L66555,u483,m29,PIKE,From up close or far away?
13643,L66554,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Full clip to the body --
13644,L66553,u483,m29,PIKE,"You saw West, right? How was he killed?"
13645,L66552,u478,m29,DUNBAR,That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
13646,L66551,u483,m29,PIKE,Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
13647,L66550,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Why... why didn't you tell me?
13648,L66545,u483,m29,PIKE,Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
13649,L66544,u478,m29,DUNBAR,You're lying --
13650,L66543,u483,m29,PIKE,Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
13651,L66542,u483,m29,PIKE,Just look. Little pocket.
13652,L66541,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Why?
13653,L66540,u483,m29,PIKE,Look in my pack.
13654,L66539,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Bullshit.
13655,L66538,u483,m29,PIKE,"Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --"
13656,L66537,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"You hated West, Mueller loved him --"
13657,L66536,u483,m29,PIKE,"Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?"
13658,L66535,u478,m29,DUNBAR,That's exactly what he says about you.
13659,L66534,u483,m29,PIKE,"We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --"
13660,L66533,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Oh, come on --"
13661,L66532,u483,m29,PIKE,Mueller.
13662,L66531,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"If not you, then who?"
13663,L66530,u483,m29,PIKE,"Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me."
13664,L66529,u483,m29,PIKE,Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
13665,L66528,u478,m29,DUNBAR,You're the only one missing a grenade.
13666,L66527,u483,m29,PIKE,"Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --"
13667,L66526,u478,m29,DUNBAR,You hated West more than any of us.
13668,L66525,u483,m29,PIKE,"You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray."
13669,L66524,u478,m29,DUNBAR,Yeah...
13670,L66523,u483,m29,PIKE,Right?
13671,L66517,u483,m29,PIKE,Do I?
13672,L66516,u478,m29,DUNBAR,You know it's not like that --
13673,L66513,u483,m29,PIKE,Why?
13674,L66512,u478,m29,DUNBAR,We just want to check your pack --
13675,L66511,u483,m29,PIKE,"Roberto, what the fuck?"
13676,L66504,u483,m29,PIKE,Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
13677,L66503,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Where have you been, Jay?"
13678,L66379,u483,m29,PIKE,I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
13679,L66378,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"What do you mean, West's?"
13680,L66377,u483,m29,PIKE,West's. Any kindling for afire?
13681,L66376,u478,m29,DUNBAR,"Whose blood is that, Jay?"
13682,L66753,u480,m29,KENDALL,Maybe he...
13683,L66752,u479,m29,HARDY,MAYBE WHAT --
13684,L66751,u480,m29,KENDALL,Maybe --
13685,L66750,u479,m29,HARDY,Where are they!
13686,L66749,u480,m29,KENDALL,I don't know --
13687,L66748,u479,m29,HARDY,"You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!"
13688,L66747,u479,m29,HARDY,But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
13689,L66746,u480,m29,KENDALL,I didn't --
13690,L66745,u479,m29,HARDY,"Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?"
13691,L66727,u480,m29,KENDALL,Because I was standing next to him.
13692,L66726,u479,m29,HARDY,How do you know?
13693,L66722,u480,m29,KENDALL,Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
13694,L66721,u479,m29,HARDY,Why?
13695,L66708,u480,m29,KENDALL,I didn't do anything --
13696,L66707,u479,m29,HARDY,"Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --"
13697,L66702,u480,m29,KENDALL,I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
13698,L66701,u479,m29,HARDY,"Something funny, Levi?"
13699,L66692,u480,m29,KENDALL,"Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective."
13700,L66691,u479,m29,HARDY,Dunbar will testify that you were.
13701,L66689,u480,m29,KENDALL,"Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?"
13702,L66688,u479,m29,HARDY,Well?
13703,L66687,u480,m29,KENDALL,"I believe your next line is ""What are you trying to hide?"""
13704,L66686,u479,m29,HARDY,"Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said ""Dunbar was gone,"" My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie."
13705,L66685,u480,m29,KENDALL,No. I said Dunbar.
13706,L66684,u479,m29,HARDY,"Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door."
13707,L66683,u480,m29,KENDALL,"So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --"
13708,L66682,u479,m29,HARDY,"Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --"
13709,L66679,u480,m29,KENDALL,"There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting."
13710,L66678,u479,m29,HARDY,Is it the truth?
13711,L66675,u479,m29,HARDY,My heart weeps.
13712,L66674,u480,m29,KENDALL,Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
13713,L66672,u479,m29,HARDY,Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
13714,L66671,u480,m29,KENDALL,How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
13715,L66670,u479,m29,HARDY,You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
13716,L66486,u479,m29,HARDY,Stop.
13717,L66485,u480,m29,KENDALL,Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
13718,L66404,u480,m29,KENDALL,Mr. Hardy?
13719,L66403,u479,m29,HARDY,Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
13720,L66402,u480,m29,KENDALL,"I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men."
13721,L66401,u479,m29,HARDY,Why did he come back for you?
13722,L66381,u480,m29,KENDALL,Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
13723,L66380,u479,m29,HARDY,He admitted it.
13724,L66311,u480,m29,KENDALL,"No. Poetic justice, though."
13725,L66310,u479,m29,HARDY,But you didn't.
13726,L66309,u480,m29,KENDALL,Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
13727,L66294,u479,m29,HARDY,Then who did?
13728,L66293,u480,m29,KENDALL,I didn't kill him --
13729,L66292,u479,m29,HARDY,"What happened to ""degrees""?"
13730,L66291,u480,m29,KENDALL,You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
13731,L66290,u479,m29,HARDY,"Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called ""motive"" and you just gave yourself one."
13732,L66262,u480,m29,KENDALL,"The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay."
13733,L66261,u479,m29,HARDY,"I think you just blew ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" out of the fucking water."
13734,L66260,u480,m29,KENDALL,"He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?"
13735,L66259,u479,m29,HARDY,Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
13736,L66258,u480,m29,KENDALL,"My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual."
13737,L66244,u480,m29,KENDALL,"My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me."
13738,L66243,u479,m29,HARDY,"But not the only victim, right?"
13739,L66242,u480,m29,KENDALL,I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
13740,L66241,u479,m29,HARDY,"Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us."
13741,L66240,u480,m29,KENDALL,"That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --"
13742,L66239,u479,m29,HARDY,"Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk."
13743,L66238,u480,m29,KENDALL,"You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?"
13744,L66980,u479,m29,HARDY,Get your hands away from the desk!
13745,L66979,u485,m29,STYLES,"For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --"
13746,L66978,u479,m29,HARDY,"You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen."
13747,L66977,u485,m29,STYLES,You're crazy --
13748,L66976,u479,m29,HARDY,"No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough."
13749,L66975,u479,m29,HARDY,Not for long.
13750,L66974,u485,m29,STYLES,"You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you."
13751,L66973,u479,m29,HARDY,"No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --"
13752,L66972,u485,m29,STYLES,I'm not even going to dignify that --
13753,L66971,u479,m29,HARDY,"You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike."
13754,L66970,u485,m29,STYLES,I wanted to see if he was okay --
13755,L66969,u479,m29,HARDY,"Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall."
13756,L66968,u485,m29,STYLES,That's preposterous --
13757,L66967,u479,m29,HARDY,"What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too."
13758,L66966,u479,m29,HARDY,West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
13759,L66965,u485,m29,STYLES,Or what? You've gone round the bend --
13760,L66964,u479,m29,HARDY,Stay where you are.
13761,L66962,u479,m29,HARDY,"I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this."
13762,L66961,u485,m29,STYLES,You're drunk --
13763,L66960,u479,m29,HARDY,"If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you."
13764,L66959,u485,m29,STYLES,What are you talking about?
13765,L66958,u479,m29,HARDY,"It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?"
13766,L66789,u485,m29,STYLES,I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
13767,L66788,u479,m29,HARDY,"You're a good soldier, Bill."
13768,L66787,u485,m29,STYLES,Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
13769,L66786,u479,m29,HARDY,"I'm sorry, Bill."
13770,L66785,u485,m29,STYLES,The Senator...
13771,L66784,u479,m29,HARDY,"They're taking your command, aren't they?"
13772,L66781,u479,m29,HARDY,"I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings."
13773,L66780,u485,m29,STYLES,You think you could explain all this to me?
13774,L66778,u485,m29,STYLES,Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
13775,L66777,u479,m29,HARDY,That's horseshit and you know it.
13776,L66776,u485,m29,STYLES,It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
13777,L66654,u485,m29,STYLES,Does Osborne agree?
13778,L66653,u479,m29,HARDY,Yeah.
13779,L66652,u485,m29,STYLES,Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
13780,L66651,u479,m29,HARDY,What I said before --
13781,L66455,u479,m29,HARDY,"I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --"
13782,L66454,u485,m29,STYLES,What the hell are you talking about --
13783,L66453,u479,m29,HARDY,"You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --"
13784,L66452,u485,m29,STYLES,What about the confession?
13785,L66451,u479,m29,HARDY,"Home, I'm done."
13786,L66450,u485,m29,STYLES,"Tom, where are you going --"
13787,L66429,u485,m29,STYLES,JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
13788,L66428,u479,m29,HARDY,You mean not enough to save you.
13789,L66427,u485,m29,STYLES,Not for me.
13790,L66426,u479,m29,HARDY,Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
13791,L66425,u485,m29,STYLES,Nevertheless --
13792,L66424,u479,m29,HARDY,"From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty."
13793,L66423,u485,m29,STYLES,Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
13794,L66422,u479,m29,HARDY,"Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --"
13795,L66421,u485,m29,STYLES,Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
13796,L66420,u479,m29,HARDY,"There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it."
13797,L66419,u485,m29,STYLES,We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
13798,L66408,u479,m29,HARDY,Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
13799,L66407,u485,m29,STYLES,Who killed Pike?
13800,L66406,u479,m29,HARDY,"Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez."
13801,L66205,u485,m29,STYLES,He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
13802,L66204,u479,m29,HARDY,"He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --"
13803,L66073,u479,m29,HARDY,I'm not gonna let that happen.
13804,L66072,u485,m29,STYLES,"Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --"
13805,L66071,u479,m29,HARDY,"And I'm the closest thing to it, right?"
13806,L66070,u485,m29,STYLES,The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
13807,L66069,u479,m29,HARDY,Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
13808,L66066,u485,m29,STYLES,Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
13809,L66065,u479,m29,HARDY,I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
13810,L66064,u485,m29,STYLES,"No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up."
13811,L66063,u479,m29,HARDY,And the problem is you only got three.
13812,L66062,u485,m29,STYLES,"The exercise was one of his Section Eight ""private sessions"". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning."
13813,L66058,u479,m29,HARDY,"Well, he's a good soldier."
13814,L66057,u485,m29,STYLES,"A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country."
13815,L66053,u479,m29,HARDY,"It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West."
13816,L66052,u485,m29,STYLES,"The official term for it is ""Clusterfuck"". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant..."
13817,L66049,u479,m29,HARDY,"And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?"
13818,L66048,u485,m29,STYLES,"This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator."
13819,L66046,u479,m29,HARDY,Tell me what I can do.
13820,L66045,u485,m29,STYLES,Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
13821,L66044,u479,m29,HARDY,That bad?
13822,L66043,u479,m29,HARDY,What kind of trouble are you in?
13823,L66042,u485,m29,STYLES,Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
13824,L66041,u479,m29,HARDY,How are you?
13825,L66996,u479,m29,HARDY,"Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks."
13826,L66995,u482,m29,OSBORNE,He was your friend.
13827,L66994,u479,m29,HARDY,In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
13828,L66993,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Your phone number?
13829,L66992,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Yeah.
13830,L66991,u479,m29,HARDY,I should probably write that down.
13831,L66990,u482,m29,OSBORNE,A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
13832,L66989,u479,m29,HARDY,Want company?
13833,L66988,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Nah.
13834,L66987,u479,m29,HARDY,Think it'll work?
13835,L66986,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened."
13836,L66985,u479,m29,HARDY,Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
13837,L66984,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What are you doing out here?
13838,L66954,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
13839,L66953,u479,m29,HARDY,Do I have a choice in this?
13840,L66951,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
13841,L66950,u479,m29,HARDY,West?
13842,L66946,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past."
13843,L66945,u479,m29,HARDY,Really.
13844,L66944,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"You're a good man, Hardy."
13845,L66943,u479,m29,HARDY,"There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees."
13846,L66942,u482,m29,OSBORNE,That's not true.
13847,L66939,u479,m29,HARDY,Tough.
13848,L66938,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What if I don't want it?
13849,L66937,u479,m29,HARDY,"This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine."
13850,L66936,u482,m29,OSBORNE,This isn't the time --
13851,L66934,u479,m29,HARDY,"Seven guys. What was it you said? You were ""just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said""."
13852,L66933,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What?
13853,L66932,u479,m29,HARDY,Seven.
13854,L66931,u482,m29,OSBORNE,We need to talk --
13855,L66920,u479,m29,HARDY,No death certificates. No crime.
13856,L66919,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"No bodies, no West..."
13857,L66859,u479,m29,HARDY,WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
13858,L66858,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Hardy, for Chrissakes --"
13859,L66857,u479,m29,HARDY,We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
13860,L66855,u479,m29,HARDY,Isn't this how your story goes?
13861,L66854,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Hardy, what are you doing --"
13862,L66832,u479,m29,HARDY,Right back where we started.
13863,L66831,u482,m29,OSBORNE,We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
13864,L66819,u479,m29,HARDY,Get in.
13865,L66818,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Four --
13866,L66803,u479,m29,HARDY,"Good, just making sure."
13867,L66802,u482,m29,OSBORNE,No.
13868,L66801,u479,m29,HARDY,"Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?"
13869,L66800,u482,m29,OSBORNE,We were close to something with Kendall.
13870,L66799,u479,m29,HARDY,That's gonna stay my secret.
13871,L66798,u482,m29,OSBORNE,For what?
13872,L66797,u479,m29,HARDY,"It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out."
13873,L66796,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"You know, you never told me why you left the army."
13874,L66795,u479,m29,HARDY,Nah.
13875,L66794,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Think it'll work?
13876,L66793,u479,m29,HARDY,"Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened."
13877,L66792,u482,m29,OSBORNE,So what now?
13878,L66775,u482,m29,OSBORNE,So did I.
13879,L66774,u479,m29,HARDY,Yeah.
13880,L66773,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You wanted to break him.
13881,L66772,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You mean the falsely accused?
13882,L66771,u479,m29,HARDY,"No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy."
13883,L66770,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You wanted to get the truth.
13884,L66769,u479,m29,HARDY,"Yeah, I could've. Should've."
13885,L66768,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You couldn't have known --
13886,L66767,u479,m29,HARDY,I pushed him too hard.
13887,L66712,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --"
13888,L66711,u479,m29,HARDY,That's a fantastic idea --
13889,L66704,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Good idea.
13890,L66703,u479,m29,HARDY,Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
13891,L66699,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Positive. Hardy, they planned this."
13892,L66698,u479,m29,HARDY,Are you sure?
13893,L66697,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"What Kendall said -- ""the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around."" That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter."
13894,L66696,u479,m29,HARDY,What?
13895,L66695,u482,m29,OSBORNE,They got their stories straight.
13896,L66694,u479,m29,HARDY,"We're fucked, I know --"
13897,L66649,u479,m29,HARDY,Let's go talk to Bill...
13898,L66648,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Little bit.
13899,L66647,u479,m29,HARDY,That bugs you too?
13900,L66646,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?"
13901,L66645,u479,m29,HARDY,"And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending."
13902,L66644,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Buttfucks the cabin?
13903,L66643,u479,m29,HARDY,"Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --"
13904,L66642,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --"
13905,L66641,u479,m29,HARDY,"And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world."
13906,L66640,u482,m29,OSBORNE,They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
13907,L66639,u479,m29,HARDY,"Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events."
13908,L66638,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Dunbar.
13909,L66637,u479,m29,HARDY,"And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness."
13910,L66636,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike."
13911,L66499,u479,m29,HARDY,What happened next?
13912,L66498,u482,m29,OSBORNE,At least you and Kendall agree on that.
13913,L66472,u479,m29,HARDY,"Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body."
13914,L66471,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What?
13915,L66470,u479,m29,HARDY,I didn't shoot West...
13916,L66468,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy."
13917,L66467,u479,m29,HARDY,Why do you care?
13918,L66466,u482,m29,OSBORNE,But you will.
13919,L66465,u479,m29,HARDY,"Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my ""great second chance"", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --"
13920,L66464,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --"
13921,L66463,u479,m29,HARDY,"Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?"
13922,L66462,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --"
13923,L66461,u479,m29,HARDY,"West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried."
13924,L66460,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
13925,L66459,u479,m29,HARDY,Watch me.
13926,L66458,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --"
13927,L66457,u479,m29,HARDY,"You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession."
13928,L66456,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --"
13929,L66449,u482,m29,OSBORNE,I don't know.
13930,L66448,u479,m29,HARDY,Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
13931,L66417,u479,m29,HARDY,"Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --"
13932,L66416,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed."
13933,L66415,u479,m29,HARDY,"Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne."
13934,L66414,u482,m29,OSBORNE,I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
13935,L66413,u479,m29,HARDY,"That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy."
13936,L66412,u482,m29,OSBORNE,I don't think that has anything to do with --
13937,L66411,u479,m29,HARDY,"""Too neat."" How long have you been an investigator?"
13938,L66252,u479,m29,HARDY,I lied. Wait for it...
13939,L66251,u482,m29,OSBORNE,But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
13940,L66250,u479,m29,HARDY,"Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight."
13941,L66249,u482,m29,OSBORNE,That was kid gloves?
13942,L66237,u479,m29,HARDY,Got it.
13943,L66236,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves."
13944,L66232,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Not the happiest of memories?
13945,L66231,u479,m29,HARDY,Being back here. Gives me the willies.
13946,L66230,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Something wrong?
13947,L66229,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What point?
13948,L66228,u479,m29,HARDY,"He's telling the truth, up to a point."
13949,L66227,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
13950,L66226,u479,m29,HARDY,You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
13951,L66225,u479,m29,HARDY,So noted.
13952,L66224,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You're off to a late start.
13953,L66223,u479,m29,HARDY,I plan to grow on you.
13954,L66222,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?"
13955,L66221,u479,m29,HARDY,The very same.
13956,L66220,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?"
13957,L66218,u479,m29,HARDY,"Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out."
13958,L66217,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You're kidding.
13959,L66216,u479,m29,HARDY,I lost a bet.
13960,L66215,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Something like that. You?
13961,L66214,u479,m29,HARDY,You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
13962,L66213,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up."
13963,L66212,u479,m29,HARDY,Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
13964,L66211,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What is that?
13965,L66210,u479,m29,HARDY,Best time for banal chit-chat.
13966,L66209,u482,m29,OSBORNE,We're in the middle of a murder case --
13967,L66208,u479,m29,HARDY,You're right. We should sit in silence.
13968,L66207,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
13969,L66140,u479,m29,HARDY,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy."
13970,L66139,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You made me look like an idiot --
13971,L66138,u479,m29,HARDY,I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
13972,L66137,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Baseball?
13973,L66133,u479,m29,HARDY,"See, Ray, this is what we call ""good cop, bad cop"". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established."
13974,L66132,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --"
13975,L66102,u479,m29,HARDY,Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
13976,L66101,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you."
13977,L66099,u479,m29,HARDY,Something like that.
13978,L66098,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Good cop/bad cop?
13979,L66097,u479,m29,HARDY,"Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got."
13980,L66096,u479,m29,HARDY,"Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?"
13981,L66095,u482,m29,OSBORNE,That is the most unprofessional --
13982,L66094,u479,m29,HARDY,Is Dunbar cute?
13983,L66093,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Excuse me?
13984,L66092,u479,m29,HARDY,"Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?"
13985,L66091,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Why?
13986,L66090,u479,m29,HARDY,Move him.
13987,L66089,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Yes.
13988,L66088,u479,m29,HARDY,He's in interrogation?
13989,L66087,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar."
13990,L66086,u479,m29,HARDY,Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
13991,L66085,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio."
13992,L66084,u479,m29,HARDY,Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
13993,L66083,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --"
13994,L66082,u479,m29,HARDY,"Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys."
13995,L66081,u479,m29,HARDY,"Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?"
13996,L66080,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this."
13997,L66079,u479,m29,HARDY,"It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --"
13998,L66078,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres."
13999,L66077,u479,m29,HARDY,He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
14000,L66076,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You and the Colonel go back.
14001,L66075,u479,m29,HARDY,"Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --"
14002,L66061,u479,m29,HARDY,And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
14003,L66060,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
14004,L66059,u479,m29,HARDY,I didn't mean that as a compliment.
14005,L66056,u479,m29,HARDY,He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
14006,L66055,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You knew Sergeant West?
14007,L66054,u479,m29,HARDY,"Ah, Christ"
14008,L66051,u479,m29,HARDY,Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
14009,L66050,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Hostile and uncooperative.
14010,L66608,u483,m29,PIKE,Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
14011,L66607,u480,m29,KENDALL,"Pike, please --"
14012,L66392,u483,m29,PIKE,"Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right."
14013,L66391,u480,m29,KENDALL,I don't think I want to hear this --
14014,L66390,u483,m29,PIKE,"Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --"
14015,L66389,u480,m29,KENDALL,How?
14016,L66388,u483,m29,PIKE,A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
14017,L66387,u480,m29,KENDALL,What are you talking about?
14018,L66386,u483,m29,PIKE,"The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --"
14019,L66592,u481,m29,MUELLER,"To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --"
14020,L66591,u480,m29,KENDALL,So you took off your shirt?
14021,L66590,u481,m29,MUELLER,I was freezing from the hurricane --
14022,L66361,u481,m29,MUELLER,I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
14023,L66360,u480,m29,KENDALL,"Oh, you remember now --"
14024,L66359,u481,m29,MUELLER,"I remember now, it was before the explosion --"
14025,L66358,u480,m29,KENDALL,Yeah and he doesn't know when --
14026,L66357,u481,m29,MUELLER,Pike and I got separated --
14027,L66354,u481,m29,MUELLER,"You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --"
14028,L66353,u480,m29,KENDALL,Poor fucker my ass...
14029,L66352,u481,m29,MUELLER,They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
14030,L66278,u481,m29,MUELLER,"Oh, yeah, ""Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on."" He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland."
14031,L66277,u480,m29,KENDALL,We should tell him we're not going.
14032,L66274,u481,m29,MUELLER,"You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?"
14033,L66273,u480,m29,KENDALL,"You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?"
14034,L66272,u481,m29,MUELLER,The faggot speaks.
14035,L66271,u480,m29,KENDALL,Maybe we shouldn't go.
14036,L66738,u480,m29,KENDALL,He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
14037,L66737,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What happened with Nunez?
14038,L66735,u482,m29,OSBORNE,So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
14039,L66734,u480,m29,KENDALL,"I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --"
14040,L66733,u480,m29,KENDALL,"I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished."
14041,L66725,u480,m29,KENDALL,Childs.
14042,L66724,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"Who, Levi --"
14043,L66720,u480,m29,KENDALL,"We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him."
14044,L66719,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Wrong answer --
14045,L66718,u480,m29,KENDALL,Dunbar's telling the truth.
14046,L66717,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What.
14047,L66716,u480,m29,KENDALL,Wait --
14048,L66715,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Enjoy your flight to Washington --
14049,L66714,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!"
14050,L66713,u480,m29,KENDALL,It won't work --
14051,L66710,u480,m29,KENDALL,What?
14052,L66709,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --"
14053,L66706,u480,m29,KENDALL,You can't threaten me --
14054,L66705,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --"
14055,L66681,u480,m29,KENDALL,"Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --"
14056,L66680,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Dunbar says you were.
14057,L66677,u480,m29,KENDALL,"No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong."
14058,L66676,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Pike never confessed.
14059,L66669,u480,m29,KENDALL,"Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?"
14060,L66668,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Fifty minutes.
14061,L66667,u480,m29,KENDALL,"Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?"
14062,L66666,u480,m29,KENDALL,"We've been making progress, I see."
14063,L66665,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Pike never confessed.
14064,L66400,u480,m29,KENDALL,"Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone."
14065,L66399,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"But you didn't see it, right?"
14066,L66398,u480,m29,KENDALL,Because he'd shot Mueller.
14067,L66397,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
14068,L66289,u480,m29,KENDALL,He whispered it in my ear.
14069,L66288,u482,m29,OSBORNE,No one else heard it?
14070,L66287,u480,m29,KENDALL,"""You're gonna die tonight, faggot"". Clear as day."
14071,L66286,u482,m29,OSBORNE,He said what?
14072,L66264,u480,m29,KENDALL,He wanted more than that.
14073,L66263,u482,m29,OSBORNE,He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
14074,L66246,u480,m29,KENDALL,"What, ""The Truth""? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem."
14075,L66245,u482,m29,OSBORNE,We just want --
14076,L66606,u483,m29,PIKE,-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
14077,L66605,u481,m29,MUELLER,Tell him to shut up --
14078,L66600,u481,m29,MUELLER,Shut up!
14079,L66599,u483,m29,PIKE,"Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --"
14080,L66598,u481,m29,MUELLER,Bullshit --
14081,L66597,u483,m29,PIKE,You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
14082,L66596,u481,m29,MUELLER,The fuck are you talking about --
14083,L66595,u483,m29,PIKE,"Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --"
14084,L66594,u481,m29,MUELLER,We're not going anywhere.
14085,L66593,u483,m29,PIKE,"Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --"
14086,L66589,u483,m29,PIKE,"Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?"
14087,L66588,u481,m29,MUELLER,I used it to start the fire --
14088,L66587,u483,m29,PIKE,"Where's your shirt, Mueller?"
14089,L66586,u481,m29,MUELLER,"We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --"
14090,L66582,u481,m29,MUELLER,Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
14091,L66581,u483,m29,PIKE,"This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --"
14092,L66579,u481,m29,MUELLER,What the fuck are you doing?
14093,L66578,u483,m29,PIKE,Thank God...
14094,L66515,u483,m29,PIKE,"Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --"
14095,L66514,u481,m29,MUELLER,Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
14096,L66502,u481,m29,MUELLER,What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
14097,L66501,u483,m29,PIKE,What the fuck happened to you --
14098,L66270,u481,m29,MUELLER,"Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit."
14099,L66269,u483,m29,PIKE,Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
14100,L66815,u484,m29,SERGEANT,"Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black."
14101,L66814,u482,m29,OSBORNE,So?
14102,L66811,u484,m29,SERGEANT,"You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right."
14103,L66810,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --"
14104,L66809,u484,m29,SERGEANT,Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
14105,L66807,u484,m29,SERGEANT,Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
14106,L66806,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Yeah.
14107,L66805,u484,m29,SERGEANT,"Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?"
14108,L67038,u485,m29,STYLES,The army kicked you out for drugs...
14109,L67037,u482,m29,OSBORNE,You never told me why you got kicked out of...
14110,L66783,u485,m29,STYLES,"Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out."
14111,L66782,u482,m29,OSBORNE,What happens to Dunbar now?
14112,L66661,u485,m29,STYLES,I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
14113,L66660,u482,m29,OSBORNE,We know.
14114,L66659,u485,m29,STYLES,"You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore."
14115,L66658,u482,m29,OSBORNE,He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
14116,L66657,u485,m29,STYLES,"You want Kendall, don't you?"
14117,L66410,u482,m29,OSBORNE,It's too neat.
14118,L66409,u485,m29,STYLES,What do you think?
14119,L66142,u482,m29,OSBORNE,No --
14120,L66141,u485,m29,STYLES,You think he did it?
14121,L66068,u485,m29,STYLES,"I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --"
14122,L66067,u482,m29,OSBORNE,Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
14123,L66039,u485,m29,STYLES,Then it's unofficial.
14124,L66038,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"He's not Army, it's not official --"
14125,L66037,u485,m29,STYLES,"He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack."
14126,L66036,u482,m29,OSBORNE,"But this guy you called, he's not even Army --"
14127,L66035,u485,m29,STYLES,"He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman."
14128,L66034,u482,m29,OSBORNE,This is totally unnecessary --
14129,L66283,u487,m29,WEST,"LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!"
14130,L66282,u486,m29,THE CADETS,"Sir, yes, sir!"
14131,L66281,u487,m29,WEST,"Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?"
14132,L66157,u487,m29,WEST,"So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!"
14133,L66156,u486,m29,THE CADETS,"Sir, yes, sir!"
14134,L66155,u487,m29,WEST,"In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!"
14135,L66154,u486,m29,THE CADETS,"Sir, yes, sir!"
14136,L66153,u487,m29,WEST,"Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!"
14137,L66152,u486,m29,THE CADETS,"Sir, yes, sir!"
14138,L66151,u487,m29,WEST,"You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!"
14139,L84067,u488,m30,AMOS,"Good luck, kid."
14140,L84066,u492,m30,EDWARD,Thank you.
14141,L84065,u488,m30,AMOS,"Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry."
14142,L84064,u492,m30,EDWARD,There's only one I want.
14143,L84063,u488,m30,AMOS,"I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl."
14144,L84062,u488,m30,AMOS,That would explain the indigestion.
14145,L84061,u492,m30,EDWARD,"A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead."
14146,L84060,u488,m30,AMOS,"Didn't kill anything, did I?"
14147,L84045,u492,m30,EDWARD,"I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is."
14148,L84044,u488,m30,AMOS,"Sorry, kid. I don't do charity."
14149,L84043,u492,m30,EDWARD,"I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet."
14150,L84041,u488,m30,AMOS,"Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there."
14151,L84040,u492,m30,EDWARD,Someone stole my backpack.
14152,L84039,u492,m30,EDWARD,I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
14153,L84038,u488,m30,AMOS,"Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back."
14154,L84037,u492,m30,EDWARD,What do you mean? You don't even know me.
14155,L84036,u488,m30,AMOS,Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
14156,L84035,u492,m30,EDWARD,Who is she? Where does she live?
14157,L84034,u488,m30,AMOS,I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
14158,L84033,u492,m30,EDWARD,Yes!
14159,L84032,u488,m30,AMOS,"Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?"
14160,L84031,u492,m30,EDWARD,I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
14161,L84030,u488,m30,AMOS,Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
14162,L84029,u492,m30,EDWARD,"I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her."
14163,L84028,u488,m30,AMOS,See! The big guy likes it.
14164,L84024,u492,m30,EDWARD,That's great.
14165,L84023,u488,m30,AMOS,Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
14166,L84021,u492,m30,EDWARD,It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
14167,L84020,u488,m30,AMOS,"Great, great. That's fantastic."
14168,L83943,u492,m30,EDWARD,I don't expect to.
14169,L83942,u489,m30,BEAMEN,You won't find a better place!
14170,L83939,u489,m30,BEAMEN,No one's ever left.
14171,L83938,u492,m30,EDWARD,"This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere."
14172,L83937,u489,m30,BEAMEN,Why?
14173,L83936,u492,m30,EDWARD,I have to leave. Tonight.
14174,L83899,u492,m30,EDWARD,It truly is.
14175,L83898,u489,m30,BEAMEN,Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
14176,L83896,u492,m30,EDWARD,No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
14177,L83895,u489,m30,BEAMEN,"He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you."
14178,L83894,u492,m30,EDWARD,The poet? What ever happened to him?
14179,L83893,u489,m30,BEAMEN,"The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow."
14180,L83892,u492,m30,EDWARD,What is this place?
14181,L83886,u489,m30,BEAMEN,Not yet.
14182,L83885,u492,m30,EDWARD,You were expecting me?
14183,L83884,u489,m30,BEAMEN,Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
14184,L83883,u492,m30,EDWARD,Yes.
14185,L83882,u489,m30,BEAMEN,Bloom like a flower?
14186,L83881,u492,m30,EDWARD,Edward Bloom.
14187,L83880,u489,m30,BEAMEN,Welcome to ya. What's your name?
14188,L84093,u492,m30,EDWARD,I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
14189,L84092,u490,m30,DON PRICE,What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
14190,L84091,u492,m30,EDWARD,Don.
14191,L84090,u490,m30,DON PRICE,Bloom!
14192,L83739,u490,m30,DON PRICE,Let's see it.
14193,L83738,u492,m30,EDWARD,I brought it.
14194,L83737,u490,m30,DON PRICE,You get the eye?
14195,L83733,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Fine, I'm doing it."
14196,L83732,u490,m30,DON PRICE,"Fine, you do it."
14197,L83731,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Fine, I will."
14198,L83730,u490,m30,DON PRICE,Then do it.
14199,L83729,u492,m30,EDWARD,I'll go in right now and get that eye.
14200,L83728,u490,m30,DON PRICE,Or are you too scared?
14201,L84364,u491,m30,DR. BENNETT,"Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born."
14202,L84363,u498,m30,WILL,No.
14203,L84362,u491,m30,DR. BENNETT,Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
14204,L84361,u498,m30,WILL,A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
14205,L84360,u491,m30,DR. BENNETT,Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
14206,L84359,u491,m30,DR. BENNETT,Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
14207,L84358,u498,m30,WILL,How would you describe him?
14208,L84357,u491,m30,DR. BENNETT,Thirty years. Maybe more.
14209,L84356,u498,m30,WILL,How long have you known my father?
14210,L84355,u498,m30,WILL,My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
14211,L84354,u491,m30,DR. BENNETT,"Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them."
14212,L83774,u491,m30,DR. BENNETT,Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
14213,L83773,u498,m30,WILL,Can I see him?
14214,L83767,u491,m30,DR. BENNETT,A pleasure.
14215,L83766,u498,m30,WILL,"Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine."
14216,L83765,u491,m30,DR. BENNETT,Will.
14217,L84318,u492,m30,EDWARD,"I'm sorry, Jenny. I am."
14218,L84317,u493,m30,JENNY,Lucky girl.
14219,L84316,u492,m30,EDWARD,"And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one."
14220,L84315,u493,m30,JENNY,I know.
14221,L84314,u492,m30,EDWARD,Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
14222,L84307,u493,m30,JENNY,Go.
14223,L84306,u492,m30,EDWARD,I'll...
14224,L84305,u493,m30,JENNY,Please. Go. Just go.
14225,L84304,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Lord, I'm sorry I..."
14226,L84303,u492,m30,EDWARD,I can get it. I can just...
14227,L84302,u493,m30,JENNY,"It's okay, just leave it."
14228,L84300,u492,m30,EDWARD,I see. I thank you for your time.
14229,L84299,u493,m30,JENNY,"I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom."
14230,L84298,u493,m30,JENNY,I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
14231,L84297,u492,m30,EDWARD,You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
14232,L84295,u492,m30,EDWARD,I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
14233,L84294,u493,m30,JENNY,I'm not convinced you should be happy.
14234,L84293,u492,m30,EDWARD,Helping people makes me happy.
14235,L84291,u492,m30,EDWARD,It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
14236,L84290,u493,m30,JENNY,"Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time."
14237,L84289,u492,m30,EDWARD,"In so many words, yes."
14238,L84287,u492,m30,EDWARD,"I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word."
14239,L84286,u493,m30,JENNY,So I've heard.
14240,L84285,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety."
14241,L84284,u493,m30,JENNY,No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
14242,L84283,u492,m30,EDWARD,How did you know?
14243,L84282,u493,m30,JENNY,You must be Edward Bloom.
14244,L83945,u492,m30,EDWARD,I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
14245,L83944,u493,m30,JENNY,Promise me you'll come back.
14246,L83941,u492,m30,EDWARD,I suspect it will hurt a lot.
14247,L83940,u493,m30,JENNY,How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
14248,L83931,u493,m30,JENNY,"And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all."
14249,L83930,u492,m30,EDWARD,You're pretty good at arithmetic.
14250,L83929,u493,m30,JENNY,"I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38."
14251,L83928,u492,m30,EDWARD,Eighteen.
14252,L83927,u493,m30,JENNY,How old are you?
14253,L83924,u493,m30,JENNY,"It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her."
14254,L83923,u492,m30,EDWARD,Yeah.
14255,L83922,u493,m30,JENNY,Was she nekkid?
14256,L83921,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Well, she... uh..."
14257,L83920,u493,m30,JENNY,What did she look like?
14258,L83919,u492,m30,EDWARD,Did you see that woman?
14259,L84115,u492,m30,EDWARD,And I like you.
14260,L84114,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I like your stories.
14261,L84113,u492,m30,EDWARD,"I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either."
14262,L84112,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,You were talking about your wedding.
14263,L84111,u492,m30,EDWARD,There was one time when I was eleven...
14264,L84110,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why."
14265,L84109,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
14266,L84108,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication."
14267,L84107,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
14268,L84011,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Well, it's not a short one."
14269,L84010,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,"Oh, so this is a tall tale?"
14270,L84009,u492,m30,EDWARD,Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
14271,L84008,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I never knew.
14272,L84007,u492,m30,EDWARD,That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
14273,L84004,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,Please?
14274,L84003,u492,m30,EDWARD,You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
14275,L84002,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,Can I take your picture?
14276,L84001,u492,m30,EDWARD,Spooning the sherbet.
14277,L83999,u492,m30,EDWARD,They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
14278,L83998,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,Stop.
14279,L83997,u492,m30,EDWARD,He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
14280,L83995,u492,m30,EDWARD,He was slipping her a little extra cream.
14281,L83994,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,"No, I understand."
14282,L83993,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Because see, my mother was banging the milkman."
14283,L83991,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, ""Your Grampa is going to die."" Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead."
14284,L83990,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,That's terrible.
14285,L83989,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, ""Your Aunt is going to die."" I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead."
14286,L83987,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,What were you dreaming about?
14287,L83986,u492,m30,EDWARD,I was dreaming.
14288,L83985,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,Hi. How are you feeling?
14289,L83958,u492,m30,EDWARD,"You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion."
14290,L83957,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,Really.
14291,L83875,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Just to be sure, you can take my pack."
14292,L83874,u495,m30,KARL,You're not trying to run away?
14293,L83873,u492,m30,EDWARD,"That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side."
14294,L83872,u495,m30,KARL,You know anyone's who's taken it?
14295,L83869,u492,m30,EDWARD,Beats me.
14296,L83868,u495,m30,KARL,What did she say?
14297,L83860,u492,m30,EDWARD,Okay.
14298,L83859,u495,m30,KARL,Okay.
14299,L83858,u492,m30,EDWARD,I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
14300,L83857,u495,m30,KARL,You don't like it?
14301,L83856,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer."
14302,L83855,u495,m30,KARL,Karl.
14303,L83854,u492,m30,EDWARD,"What's your name, Giant?"
14304,L83853,u495,m30,KARL,"You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here."
14305,L83852,u492,m30,EDWARD,So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
14306,L83851,u495,m30,KARL,I can.
14307,L83850,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?"
14308,L83849,u495,m30,KARL,Really?
14309,L83848,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em."
14310,L84408,u492,m30,EDWARD,Yes. Exactly.
14311,L84407,u498,m30,WILL,You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
14312,L84402,u492,m30,EDWARD,Story of my life.
14313,L84401,u498,m30,WILL,It's unbelievable.
14314,L84398,u492,m30,EDWARD,The River!
14315,L84397,u498,m30,WILL,You say...
14316,L84396,u498,m30,WILL,Where are we headed?
14317,L84383,u498,m30,WILL,"Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say..."
14318,L84382,u492,m30,EDWARD,Let's get out of here.
14319,L84378,u498,m30,WILL,Okay. Okay.
14320,L84377,u492,m30,EDWARD,Like this.
14321,L84376,u498,m30,WILL,"I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts."
14322,L84373,u492,m30,EDWARD,How I go.
14323,L84372,u498,m30,WILL,How what happens?
14324,L84371,u492,m30,EDWARD,Tell me how it happens.
14325,L84370,u498,m30,WILL,The river?
14326,L84369,u492,m30,EDWARD,The river.
14327,L84193,u492,m30,EDWARD,"I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine."
14328,L84192,u498,m30,WILL,"Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once."
14329,L84191,u492,m30,EDWARD,"What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?"
14330,L84190,u492,m30,EDWARD,"It would kill you, huh?"
14331,L84189,u498,m30,WILL,"Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me."
14332,L84188,u498,m30,WILL,Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
14333,L84187,u492,m30,EDWARD,You think I'm fake.
14334,L84186,u498,m30,WILL,"You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake."
14335,L84185,u492,m30,EDWARD,"I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories."
14336,L84184,u498,m30,WILL,I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
14337,L84183,u492,m30,EDWARD,"What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?"
14338,L84182,u498,m30,WILL,The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
14339,L84181,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, ""The thing about icebergs is..."""
14340,L84180,u498,m30,WILL,I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
14341,L84179,u492,m30,EDWARD,What?
14342,L84178,u498,m30,WILL,Dad!
14343,L84177,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth."
14344,L84176,u498,m30,WILL,"Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?"
14345,L84173,u498,m30,WILL,Can we talk?
14346,L84172,u492,m30,EDWARD,Son?
14347,L84171,u498,m30,WILL,Dad?
14348,L84170,u492,m30,EDWARD,But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
14349,L84168,u492,m30,EDWARD,I think someone hasn't.
14350,L84167,u498,m30,WILL,The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
14351,L84166,u498,m30,WILL,Yes.
14352,L84165,u492,m30,EDWARD,Did I ever tell you about how...
14353,L83962,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Oh, so you know."
14354,L83961,u498,m30,WILL,Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
14355,L83960,u492,m30,EDWARD,It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
14356,L83959,u498,m30,WILL,"Why not religion, Dad?"
14357,L83814,u492,m30,EDWARD,I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
14358,L83813,u498,m30,WILL,I thought you weren't dying.
14359,L83811,u498,m30,WILL,"I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot."
14360,L83810,u492,m30,EDWARD,You know where the chemicals are?
14361,L83809,u498,m30,WILL,I will.
14362,L83808,u492,m30,EDWARD,Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
14363,L83807,u498,m30,WILL,I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
14364,L83806,u492,m30,EDWARD,"You mean, while I'm here."
14365,L83805,u498,m30,WILL,"Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here."
14366,L83803,u498,m30,WILL,You're right.
14367,L83802,u492,m30,EDWARD,There's a lot you don't know about me.
14368,L83801,u498,m30,WILL,When did you ever work in an office?
14369,L83800,u492,m30,EDWARD,True story.
14370,L83799,u498,m30,WILL,Really.
14371,L83798,u492,m30,EDWARD,You owe me three-fifty.
14372,L83797,u498,m30,WILL,What did he say?
14373,L83796,u492,m30,EDWARD,"And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?"
14374,L83795,u498,m30,WILL,Okay.
14375,L83794,u492,m30,EDWARD,There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
14376,L83793,u492,m30,EDWARD,Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
14377,L83792,u498,m30,WILL,So how does it happen?
14378,L83791,u492,m30,EDWARD,I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
14379,L83790,u498,m30,WILL,"No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic."
14380,L83789,u492,m30,EDWARD,She was a witch.
14381,L83788,u498,m30,WILL,The Old Lady by the swamp.
14382,L83787,u492,m30,EDWARD,Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
14383,L83786,u498,m30,WILL,Really.
14384,L83785,u492,m30,EDWARD,People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
14385,L83783,u492,m30,EDWARD,You learned from the best.
14386,L83782,u498,m30,WILL,You think I'm up for it?
14387,L83781,u492,m30,EDWARD,"No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine."
14388,L83780,u498,m30,WILL,Did you do any of that?
14389,L83779,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings..."
14390,L83778,u498,m30,WILL,Am I?
14391,L83777,u492,m30,EDWARD,You --  -- are in for a surprise.
14392,L83705,u498,m30,WILL,I'm not scared.
14393,L83704,u492,m30,EDWARD,Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
14394,L83703,u498,m30,WILL,The one about the witch.
14395,L83675,u498,m30,WILL,"No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?"
14396,L83674,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story."
14397,L83673,u498,m30,WILL,Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
14398,L83672,u492,m30,EDWARD,Jesus Christ.
14399,L83671,u498,m30,WILL,I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
14400,L83670,u492,m30,EDWARD,"What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?"
14401,L83659,u498,m30,WILL,Make him stop.
14402,L83658,u492,m30,EDWARD,"You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish."
14403,L84239,u497,m30,SANDRA,I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
14404,L84238,u492,m30,EDWARD,I was drying out.
14405,L84104,u492,m30,EDWARD,Go out with me.
14406,L84103,u497,m30,SANDRA,How can I convince you to stop?
14407,L84086,u492,m30,EDWARD,I have the rest of my life to find out.
14408,L84085,u497,m30,SANDRA,You don't even know me.
14409,L84084,u492,m30,EDWARD,I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
14410,L84083,u497,m30,SANDRA,How did you get so many?
14411,L84082,u492,m30,EDWARD,They're your favorite flower.
14412,L84081,u497,m30,SANDRA,Daffodils?
14413,L84074,u497,m30,SANDRA,"But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you."
14414,L84073,u492,m30,EDWARD,Oh.
14415,L84071,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today..."
14416,L84070,u497,m30,SANDRA,I'm sorry.
14417,L84229,u496,m30,NORTHER WINSLOW,"Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it."
14418,L84228,u492,m30,EDWARD,'Fraid so.
14419,L84227,u496,m30,NORTHER WINSLOW,This is it? The whole vault.
14420,L84218,u496,m30,NORTHER WINSLOW,I'm robbing this place.
14421,L84217,u492,m30,EDWARD,So what are you up to now?
14422,L84216,u492,m30,EDWARD,"That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped."
14423,L84215,u496,m30,NORTHER WINSLOW,"I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto."
14424,L84214,u492,m30,EDWARD,I don't believe it!
14425,L84213,u492,m30,EDWARD,I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
14426,L84212,u496,m30,NORTHER WINSLOW,It's me. Norther Winslow.
14427,L83915,u492,m30,EDWARD,"You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could."
14428,L83914,u496,m30,NORTHER WINSLOW,I can't imagine any place better than here.
14429,L83913,u492,m30,EDWARD,"Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?"
14430,L83912,u496,m30,NORTHER WINSLOW,This is why you don't show work in progress.
14431,L83910,u496,m30,NORTHER WINSLOW,There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
14432,L83909,u492,m30,EDWARD,Really.
14433,L83908,u496,m30,NORTHER WINSLOW,I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
14434,L83903,u496,m30,NORTHER WINSLOW,There is no softer ground than town.
14435,L83902,u492,m30,EDWARD,Wait! I need those!
14436,L84326,u493,m30,JENNY,"Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale."
14437,L84325,u498,m30,WILL,You didn't become crazy.
14438,L84324,u493,m30,JENNY,"No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else."
14439,L84323,u498,m30,WILL,"Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young."
14440,L84267,u498,m30,WILL,"My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two."
14441,L84266,u493,m30,JENNY,"Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game."
14442,L84265,u498,m30,WILL,Because he's dying.
14443,L84264,u493,m30,JENNY,"Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?"
14444,L84263,u498,m30,WILL,"I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof."
14445,L84262,u493,m30,JENNY,"Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour."
14446,L84261,u498,m30,WILL,Were you and my father having an affair?
14447,L84260,u493,m30,JENNY,"This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him."
14448,L84259,u498,m30,WILL,How did you know my father?
14449,L84255,u493,m30,JENNY,"I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this."
14450,L84254,u498,m30,WILL,Are you Jenny Hill?
14451,L84253,u493,m30,JENNY,I wasn't expecting you.
14452,L84252,u498,m30,WILL,Hello.
14453,L84251,u493,m30,JENNY,Oh. Oh.
14454,L84351,u497,m30,SANDRA,"I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking."
14455,L84350,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I do.
14456,L84349,u497,m30,SANDRA,"Do you like it, being pregnant?"
14457,L84348,u497,m30,SANDRA,I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
14458,L84347,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
14459,L84200,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I need to lie down for a bit.
14460,L84199,u497,m30,SANDRA,I'm going to check on him.
14461,L84175,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I'll help you.
14462,L84174,u497,m30,SANDRA,I'm going to get started on dishes.
14463,L83955,u497,m30,SANDRA,We'll have to pick up a copy.
14464,L83954,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
14465,L83758,u497,m30,SANDRA,Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
14466,L83757,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,Yes.
14467,L83756,u497,m30,SANDRA,Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
14468,L84336,u498,m30,WILL,Is he going to be okay?
14469,L84335,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
14470,L84334,u498,m30,WILL,What happened?
14471,L84164,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
14472,L84163,u498,m30,WILL,I need you on my side.
14473,L84162,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,You're not.
14474,L84161,u498,m30,WILL,"Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy."
14475,L84160,u498,m30,WILL,"What is ""true?"" I've never heard my father say a single true thing."
14476,L84159,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,But it's not true.
14477,L84158,u498,m30,WILL,"You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place."
14478,L84157,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,Do you love him?
14479,L84156,u498,m30,WILL,Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
14480,L84155,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,Do you love your father?
14481,L84154,u498,m30,WILL,"Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman."
14482,L84153,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,"Mmm, what?"
14483,L84152,u498,m30,WILL,Mmm.
14484,L84151,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,But it's romantic.
14485,L84150,u498,m30,WILL,That's because most of it never happened.
14486,L84149,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
14487,L84148,u498,m30,WILL,They met at Auburn.
14488,L84147,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,You never told me how your parents met.
14489,L84146,u498,m30,WILL,Did you?
14490,L84145,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I talked with your father last night.
14491,L83701,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I'm going with you.
14492,L83700,u498,m30,WILL,You don't have to.
14493,L83699,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,I'm going with you.
14494,L83698,u498,m30,WILL,Probably tonight.
14495,L83697,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,You need to go.
14496,L83696,u498,m30,WILL,It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
14497,L83695,u494,m30,JOSEPHINE,It's bad.
14498,L84346,u497,m30,SANDRA,Yes. Thank you.
14499,L84345,u498,m30,WILL,"Mom, do you want some time with Dad?"
14500,L84341,u497,m30,SANDRA,That's okay?
14501,L84340,u498,m30,WILL,I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
14502,L84339,u497,m30,SANDRA,"I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there."
14503,L84249,u497,m30,SANDRA,Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
14504,L84248,u498,m30,WILL,So you never bought any land.
14505,L84247,u497,m30,SANDRA,I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
14506,L84246,u498,m30,WILL,Did you and Dad have any other property?
14507,L84245,u497,m30,SANDRA,Yes?
14508,L84244,u498,m30,WILL,Mom?
14509,L84243,u497,m30,SANDRA,He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
14510,L84242,u498,m30,WILL,Is he awake?
14511,L84198,u497,m30,SANDRA,Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
14512,L84197,u498,m30,WILL,That really happened?
14513,L83982,u497,m30,SANDRA,Do you know who that is?
14514,L83981,u498,m30,WILL,No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
14515,L83980,u497,m30,SANDRA,Was she one of your teachers?
14516,L83979,u498,m30,WILL,"Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair."
14517,L83978,u497,m30,SANDRA,"Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important."
14518,L83977,u497,m30,SANDRA,"Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now."
14519,L83976,u498,m30,WILL,"But I understand you, Mom. I always have."
14520,L83975,u497,m30,SANDRA,"I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all."
14521,L83974,u498,m30,WILL,"True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will."
14522,L83973,u497,m30,SANDRA,"Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that."
14523,L83972,u498,m30,WILL,Josephine and I have a lot in common.
14524,L83971,u497,m30,SANDRA,"No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two."
14525,L83970,u498,m30,WILL,Yes. But that's a different...
14526,L83969,u497,m30,SANDRA,Would you say you understand Josephine?
14527,L83968,u497,m30,SANDRA,"Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know."
14528,L83967,u498,m30,WILL,"How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him."
14529,L83966,u497,m30,SANDRA,Yes.
14530,L83965,u498,m30,WILL,"What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?"
14531,L83964,u497,m30,SANDRA,Of course.
14532,L83963,u498,m30,WILL,"Mom, would you say you understand Dad?"
14533,L83953,u497,m30,SANDRA,Really! That's wonderful.
14534,L83952,u498,m30,WILL,"I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek."
14535,L83764,u497,m30,SANDRA,You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
14536,L83763,u498,m30,WILL,How much time does he have left?
14537,L83762,u497,m30,SANDRA,"He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat."
14538,L83761,u498,m30,WILL,How is he?
14539,L83760,u497,m30,SANDRA,He's up with your father.
14540,L83759,u498,m30,WILL,Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
14541,L83751,u497,m30,SANDRA,You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
14542,L83750,u498,m30,WILL,We rented a car.
14543,L83749,u497,m30,SANDRA,Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
14544,L83748,u498,m30,WILL,"We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really."
14545,L83747,u497,m30,SANDRA,How did you get here?
14546,L85802,u504,m31,YURI,"The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever."
14547,L85801,u499,m31,ALEXEI,The sets were good.
14548,L85800,u504,m31,YURI,Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
14549,L85799,u499,m31,ALEXEI,Yeah it was okay.
14550,L85796,u504,m31,YURI,I paid for those guitar cases.
14551,L85795,u499,m31,ALEXEI,Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
14552,L85794,u504,m31,YURI,When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
14553,L85793,u499,m31,ALEXEI,Such as?
14554,L85792,u504,m31,YURI,I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
14555,L85791,u499,m31,ALEXEI,I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
14556,L85790,u504,m31,YURI,No I don't.
14557,L85789,u499,m31,ALEXEI,You know what for.
14558,L85788,u504,m31,YURI,What for?
14559,L85787,u499,m31,ALEXEI,Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me 150.
14560,L85783,u504,m31,YURI,Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
14561,L85782,u499,m31,ALEXEI,You first.
14562,L86050,u502,m31,NADIA,No I haven't.
14563,L86049,u499,m31,ALEXEI,You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
14564,L86048,u502,m31,NADIA,Leave him!
14565,L86047,u499,m31,ALEXEI,What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
14566,L86045,u502,m31,NADIA,What are you doing here?
14567,L86044,u499,m31,ALEXEI,What? What are you doing?
14568,L85832,u502,m31,NADIA,Name it.
14569,L85831,u499,m31,ALEXEI,A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
14570,L85829,u502,m31,NADIA,You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
14571,L85828,u499,m31,ALEXEI,What?
14572,L85826,u499,m31,ALEXEI,Thank you.
14573,L85825,u502,m31,NADIA,Say thank you.
14574,L85824,u499,m31,ALEXEI,Yeah.
14575,L85823,u502,m31,NADIA,Do you like it?
14576,L85816,u502,m31,NADIA,It is. I did it cooking.
14577,L85815,u499,m31,ALEXEI,That's not a burn.
14578,L85814,u502,m31,NADIA,It's nothing. I burnt myself.
14579,L85813,u499,m31,ALEXEI,What's this?
14580,L85812,u499,m31,ALEXEI,We'll stop then.
14581,L85811,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14582,L85810,u499,m31,ALEXEI,Do you want to stop?
14583,L85809,u502,m31,NADIA,"You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop."
14584,L85808,u499,m31,ALEXEI,What do you mean?
14585,L85807,u502,m31,NADIA,It's enough isn't it?
14586,L85785,u499,m31,ALEXEI,There's over eighty thousand here.
14587,L85784,u502,m31,NADIA,"Sixty four thousand, eight hundred."
14588,L85760,u501,m31,JOHN,Right.
14589,L85759,u500,m31,BRANCH MANAGER,I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
14590,L85758,u501,m31,JOHN,Hello.
14591,L85710,u501,m31,JOHN,Uh... Yes.
14592,L85709,u500,m31,BRANCH MANAGER,You can see why it's sensitive?
14593,L85708,u501,m31,JOHN,Right.
14594,L85707,u500,m31,BRANCH MANAGER,To customers approaching the bank from the rear
14595,L85706,u501,m31,JOHN,Ch...
14596,L85705,u500,m31,BRANCH MANAGER,This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
14597,L85755,u501,m31,JOHN,Leave her alone.
14598,L85754,u504,m31,YURI,I'm so sorry.
14599,L85753,u501,m31,JOHN,Just leave her alone.
14600,L85752,u501,m31,JOHN,Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
14601,L85751,u504,m31,YURI,He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
14602,L85750,u501,m31,JOHN,Oh Jesus.
14603,L85749,u501,m31,JOHN,I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
14604,L85748,u504,m31,YURI,You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
14605,L85747,u501,m31,JOHN,I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
14606,L85746,u504,m31,YURI,He wants the money from your bank.
14607,L85745,u501,m31,JOHN,I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
14608,L85744,u504,m31,YURI,He wants a lot of money.
14609,L85743,u501,m31,JOHN,Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
14610,L85742,u504,m31,YURI,He wants money.
14611,L85741,u501,m31,JOHN,What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
14612,L85740,u504,m31,YURI,He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
14613,L85739,u501,m31,JOHN,What did he say? Tell me!
14614,L85738,u501,m31,JOHN,What? What does he want?
14615,L85737,u504,m31,YURI,"He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says."
14616,L85736,u501,m31,JOHN,"Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him."
14617,L85735,u504,m31,YURI,John.
14618,L85734,u501,m31,JOHN,Put the fucking kettle down.
14619,L85726,u501,m31,JOHN,Good night.
14620,L85725,u504,m31,YURI,I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
14621,L85724,u501,m31,JOHN,You can stay tonight.
14622,L85723,u504,m31,YURI,I understand. I'm so sorry
14623,L85715,u504,m31,YURI,To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
14624,L85714,u501,m31,JOHN,Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
14625,L85713,u504,m31,YURI,How is bank?
14626,L85697,u504,m31,YURI,"It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something."
14627,L85696,u501,m31,JOHN,I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
14628,L85695,u504,m31,YURI,Do you believe in love?
14629,L85694,u501,m31,JOHN,No. It's not that.
14630,L85693,u504,m31,YURI,You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
14631,L85692,u504,m31,YURI,He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
14632,L85691,u501,m31,JOHN,Tell me what he said.
14633,L85690,u504,m31,YURI,No. It is too judgmental.
14634,L85689,u501,m31,JOHN,Tell me.
14635,L85688,u504,m31,YURI,Oh nothing.
14636,L85687,u501,m31,JOHN,What was that?
14637,L85682,u504,m31,YURI,Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
14638,L85681,u501,m31,JOHN,Binoculars.
14639,L85680,u504,m31,YURI,"""I have these uh..."" She explains to you... ""When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses."" Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds."
14640,L85679,u501,m31,JOHN,I...
14641,L85678,u504,m31,YURI,"""I saw you waiting there, by the gate."""
14642,L85677,u501,m31,JOHN,When?
14643,L85675,u501,m31,JOHN,What?
14644,L85674,u504,m31,YURI,She says she has a secret to tell.
14645,L85671,u504,m31,YURI,Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
14646,L85670,u501,m31,JOHN,Uh. Do you like England?
14647,L85669,u504,m31,YURI,She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
14648,L85665,u501,m31,JOHN,"No, no..."
14649,L85664,u504,m31,YURI,You're asking for my documents?
14650,L85663,u501,m31,JOHN,You must have a visa or something...
14651,L85662,u504,m31,YURI,"Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth."
14652,L85661,u501,m31,JOHN,So how long will you be in England?
14653,L85659,u501,m31,JOHN,Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
14654,L85658,u504,m31,YURI,I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
14655,L85657,u501,m31,JOHN,What was that?
14656,L85656,u504,m31,YURI,"So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are."
14657,L85655,u501,m31,JOHN,So?
14658,L85654,u504,m31,YURI,Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
14659,L85653,u501,m31,JOHN,No.
14660,L85651,u504,m31,YURI,"I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me."
14661,L85650,u501,m31,JOHN,Right.
14662,L85649,u504,m31,YURI,We better watch him. He's crazy.
14663,L85648,u501,m31,JOHN,Right.
14664,L85647,u504,m31,YURI,"Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem."
14665,L85646,u501,m31,JOHN,So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
14666,L85644,u504,m31,YURI,"Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us."
14667,L85643,u501,m31,JOHN,Hold on.
14668,L85642,u504,m31,YURI,"And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you."
14669,L85641,u501,m31,JOHN,And...
14670,L85640,u504,m31,YURI,Good.
14671,L85639,u501,m31,JOHN,Yes. I know.
14672,L85638,u504,m31,YURI,Oh.  We are Russian.
14673,L85637,u501,m31,JOHN,I need to know who you are first please.
14674,L85635,u504,m31,YURI,He says he feels safe here.
14675,L85634,u501,m31,JOHN,What did he say?
14676,L85629,u504,m31,YURI,What?
14677,L85628,u501,m31,JOHN,I'm asking what you're here for.
14678,L85627,u504,m31,YURI,Sorry. You've lost me...
14679,L85626,u501,m31,JOHN,What are you doing here?
14680,L85625,u504,m31,YURI,"You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates."
14681,L85624,u501,m31,JOHN,"Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?"
14682,L85623,u504,m31,YURI,How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
14683,L86104,u501,m31,JOHN,Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
14684,L86103,u502,m31,NADIA,My name's Sophia.
14685,L86090,u501,m31,JOHN,Right.
14686,L86089,u502,m31,NADIA,Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
14687,L86088,u502,m31,NADIA,Maybe you will find out.
14688,L86087,u501,m31,JOHN,What does it mean?
14689,L86084,u502,m31,NADIA,Tell me about it.
14690,L86083,u501,m31,JOHN,It's a long way to go for a date.
14691,L86082,u502,m31,NADIA,It's more like a date.
14692,L86081,u501,m31,JOHN,No. What? No. I know.
14693,L86080,u502,m31,NADIA,I'm not asking you to marry me.
14694,L86079,u501,m31,JOHN,Why?
14695,L86076,u502,m31,NADIA,It's what you came back for.
14696,L86075,u501,m31,JOHN,It's not mine either.
14697,L86074,u502,m31,NADIA,It's not mine.
14698,L86071,u501,m31,JOHN,Please.
14699,L86070,u502,m31,NADIA,I'm sorry.
14700,L86069,u501,m31,JOHN,Whatever.
14701,L86068,u502,m31,NADIA,You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
14702,L86067,u501,m31,JOHN,Goodbye.
14703,L86066,u502,m31,NADIA,I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
14704,L86065,u501,m31,JOHN,You can probably buy them on the flight.
14705,L86063,u501,m31,JOHN,Okay. Promise?
14706,L86062,u502,m31,NADIA,Something else.
14707,L86060,u502,m31,NADIA,Goodbye.
14708,L86059,u501,m31,JOHN,Okay. Goodbye.
14709,L86032,u501,m31,JOHN,Because it was a lie.
14710,L86031,u502,m31,NADIA,Please. Why not?
14711,L86030,u501,m31,JOHN,Yeah. No thanks.
14712,L86028,u501,m31,JOHN,Whatever.
14713,L86027,u502,m31,NADIA,Okay. Thank you.
14714,L86026,u501,m31,JOHN,No. I think I better just go.
14715,L86025,u502,m31,NADIA,I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
14716,L86024,u501,m31,JOHN,It's alright.
14717,L86023,u502,m31,NADIA,You know you can come under the blanket.
14718,L86021,u501,m31,JOHN,What's your name?
14719,L86020,u502,m31,NADIA,What was her name?
14720,L86019,u501,m31,JOHN,I don't know.
14721,L86017,u501,m31,JOHN,Except for Small Eyes.
14722,L86016,u502,m31,NADIA,Except for Small Eyes.
14723,L86015,u501,m31,JOHN,I don't want anyone to die.
14724,L86014,u502,m31,NADIA,Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
14725,L86013,u501,m31,JOHN,Nobody's that unhappy.
14726,L86012,u502,m31,NADIA,I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
14727,L86011,u501,m31,JOHN,I've got news for you. It's not working.
14728,L86010,u502,m31,NADIA,I'm trying to quit.
14729,L86009,u501,m31,JOHN,You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
14730,L86008,u501,m31,JOHN,Laugh it up.
14731,L86007,u502,m31,NADIA,She's alive!! She is not dead?
14732,L86006,u502,m31,NADIA,She's alive?
14733,L86005,u501,m31,JOHN,I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
14734,L86004,u502,m31,NADIA,What?
14735,L86003,u501,m31,JOHN,I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
14736,L86002,u502,m31,NADIA,I'm sorry.
14737,L86000,u501,m31,JOHN,She's dead.
14738,L85999,u502,m31,NADIA,"Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?"
14739,L85998,u501,m31,JOHN,It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
14740,L85997,u502,m31,NADIA,The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
14741,L85996,u501,m31,JOHN,What?
14742,L85995,u502,m31,NADIA,What happened between you and the blonde?
14743,L85991,u502,m31,NADIA,Not really. Maybe a little.
14744,L85990,u501,m31,JOHN,Are you scared?
14745,L85989,u502,m31,NADIA,No.
14746,L85988,u501,m31,JOHN,Have you had any before?
14747,L85987,u502,m31,NADIA,No.
14748,L85986,u501,m31,JOHN,Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
14749,L85984,u501,m31,JOHN,Well what have you got?
14750,L85983,u502,m31,NADIA,I don't have nothing.
14751,L85982,u501,m31,JOHN,"I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing."
14752,L85981,u502,m31,NADIA,You are pretty naive if you think it is.
14753,L85980,u501,m31,JOHN,Thank Christ for that.
14754,L85979,u502,m31,NADIA,"The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans."
14755,L85978,u501,m31,JOHN,Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
14756,L85977,u502,m31,NADIA,Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
14757,L85976,u501,m31,JOHN,Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
14758,L85975,u502,m31,NADIA,I wasn't saying anything.
14759,L85974,u501,m31,JOHN,"Please, there's no... Oh."
14760,L85973,u502,m31,NADIA,What? I... I wasn't saying...
14761,L85972,u501,m31,JOHN,You don't have to say anything
14762,L85971,u502,m31,NADIA,"You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world."
14763,L85965,u501,m31,JOHN,Get out.
14764,L85964,u502,m31,NADIA,You are throwing me out.
14765,L85963,u501,m31,JOHN,Get out
14766,L85962,u502,m31,NADIA,Excuse me?
14767,L85959,u502,m31,NADIA,You don't understand you either.
14768,L85958,u501,m31,JOHN,You don't understand me.
14769,L85957,u502,m31,NADIA,"So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?"
14770,L85956,u501,m31,JOHN,It wasn't what I wanted.
14771,L85955,u502,m31,NADIA,You didn't mind too much.
14772,L85954,u501,m31,JOHN,I got what I paid for.
14773,L85953,u502,m31,NADIA,You...
14774,L85952,u501,m31,JOHN,What?
14775,L85951,u502,m31,NADIA,Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
14776,L85950,u501,m31,JOHN,"I think it's my safest bet, don't you?"
14777,L85949,u502,m31,NADIA,So now you hate all women?
14778,L85948,u501,m31,JOHN,"Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die."
14779,L85947,u502,m31,NADIA,Why?
14780,L85946,u501,m31,JOHN,I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
14781,L85945,u502,m31,NADIA,"There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John."
14782,L85944,u501,m31,JOHN,Some... What does that mean?
14783,L85943,u502,m31,NADIA,Sometimes neither.
14784,L85942,u501,m31,JOHN,Sometimes which?
14785,L85941,u502,m31,NADIA,Sometimes.
14786,L85940,u501,m31,JOHN,"So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?"
14787,L85938,u501,m31,JOHN,Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
14788,L85937,u502,m31,NADIA,"Whereas ""Wet 'n' Wild"" is an emotional journey. ""Tied and Tethered"". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina."
14789,L85936,u501,m31,JOHN,So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
14790,L85935,u502,m31,NADIA,What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
14791,L85934,u501,m31,JOHN,And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
14792,L85933,u502,m31,NADIA,And who says what is wrong.
14793,L85932,u501,m31,JOHN,And. It's wrong.
14794,L85931,u502,m31,NADIA,And? What are you saying?
14795,L85930,u501,m31,JOHN,Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
14796,L85929,u502,m31,NADIA,I don't hate you.
14797,L85928,u501,m31,JOHN,So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
14798,L85927,u502,m31,NADIA,We'll pretend it never happened.
14799,L85926,u502,m31,NADIA,Okay we won't talk about it.
14800,L85925,u501,m31,JOHN,No.
14801,L85924,u502,m31,NADIA,You don't want to talk about it.
14802,L85923,u501,m31,JOHN,Shut up. I'm not listening.
14803,L85922,u502,m31,NADIA,Why not?
14804,L85921,u501,m31,JOHN,I don't want to talk about it.
14805,L85918,u502,m31,NADIA,No. But you tend to tie them up.
14806,L85917,u501,m31,JOHN,Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
14807,L85916,u502,m31,NADIA,He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
14808,L85915,u501,m31,JOHN,Excuse me?
14809,L85914,u502,m31,NADIA,He will come back.
14810,L85913,u501,m31,JOHN,Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
14811,L85911,u502,m31,NADIA,"But, you know, so what?"
14812,L85910,u501,m31,JOHN,Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
14813,L85909,u502,m31,NADIA,"If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does."
14814,L85908,u501,m31,JOHN,Oh Jesus.
14815,L85907,u502,m31,NADIA,"Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is."
14816,L85906,u501,m31,JOHN,So uh...
14817,L85905,u501,m31,JOHN,Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
14818,L85904,u502,m31,NADIA,It's none of your business.
14819,L85903,u501,m31,JOHN,Fine.
14820,L85902,u502,m31,NADIA,I don't want to talk about him.
14821,L85901,u501,m31,JOHN,"So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name..."
14822,L85899,u502,m31,NADIA,I said I don't have any.
14823,L85898,u501,m31,JOHN,What?
14824,L85897,u502,m31,NADIA,I don't have any money.
14825,L85896,u501,m31,JOHN,Give me some money.
14826,L85894,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14827,L85893,u501,m31,JOHN,Shut up. Have you got your passport?
14828,L85892,u502,m31,NADIA,What?
14829,L85891,u501,m31,JOHN,Have you got your passport?
14830,L85890,u502,m31,NADIA,You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
14831,L85878,u501,m31,JOHN,No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
14832,L85877,u502,m31,NADIA,I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
14833,L85876,u501,m31,JOHN,What? No you're not..
14834,L85875,u502,m31,NADIA,I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
14835,L85874,u501,m31,JOHN,What?
14836,L85873,u502,m31,NADIA,Where's the restroom?
14837,L85871,u501,m31,JOHN,"Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash."
14838,L85870,u502,m31,NADIA,You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
14839,L85869,u501,m31,JOHN,In every sense. If at all possible.
14840,L85868,u502,m31,NADIA,So you're just going to be vindictive
14841,L85867,u501,m31,JOHN,I do. I want to very badly.
14842,L85866,u502,m31,NADIA,I know you just want to punish me --
14843,L85865,u501,m31,JOHN,In the world.
14844,L85864,u502,m31,NADIA,No I don't.
14845,L85863,u501,m31,JOHN,You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
14846,L85856,u501,m31,JOHN,Well as it turns out I did.
14847,L85855,u502,m31,NADIA,Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
14848,L85854,u501,m31,JOHN,Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
14849,L85853,u502,m31,NADIA,They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
14850,L85852,u501,m31,JOHN,"I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison."
14851,L85851,u502,m31,NADIA,So what are you going to do?
14852,L85850,u501,m31,JOHN,That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
14853,L85849,u502,m31,NADIA,"It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why."
14854,L85848,u501,m31,JOHN,I don't want to know.
14855,L85847,u502,m31,NADIA,It's makes it easier. Okay.
14856,L85846,u501,m31,JOHN,"Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee."
14857,L85845,u501,m31,JOHN,"I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously."
14858,L85844,u502,m31,NADIA,You don't understand anything.
14859,L85843,u501,m31,JOHN,"Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber."
14860,L85722,u502,m31,NADIA,They go.
14861,L85721,u501,m31,JOHN,Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
14862,L85720,u502,m31,NADIA,They go.
14863,L85719,u501,m31,JOHN,What's wrong?
14864,L85718,u502,m31,NADIA,They go. John. They go.
14865,L85632,u501,m31,JOHN,Yes I know.
14866,L85631,u502,m31,NADIA,"""Frenzy""."
14867,L85616,u501,m31,JOHN,Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
14868,L85615,u502,m31,NADIA,Syevodnya
14869,L85614,u501,m31,JOHN,Syevodnya?
14870,L85612,u502,m31,NADIA,Happy bath day.
14871,L85611,u501,m31,JOHN,I don't understand.
14872,L85608,u501,m31,JOHN,Sorry?
14873,L85607,u502,m31,NADIA,Today is bath day.
14874,L85560,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14875,L85559,u501,m31,JOHN,Uh... Are you a giraffe?
14876,L85558,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14877,L85557,u501,m31,JOHN,Do you follow or should I speak slower?
14878,L85556,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14879,L85555,u501,m31,JOHN,Good. Or should I speak slower?
14880,L85554,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14881,L85553,u501,m31,JOHN,Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
14882,L85552,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14883,L85551,u501,m31,JOHN,"And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?"
14884,L85550,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14885,L85549,u501,m31,JOHN,I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
14886,L85548,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14887,L85547,u501,m31,JOHN,So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
14888,L85544,u501,m31,JOHN,"I mean... ""Ants."" ""I've got a problem with ants."""
14889,L85543,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14890,L85542,u501,m31,JOHN,I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
14891,L85541,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14892,L85540,u501,m31,JOHN,I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
14893,L85539,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14894,L85538,u501,m31,JOHN,"It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand ""ants""?"
14895,L85536,u501,m31,JOHN,Right. Okay. Good.
14896,L85535,u502,m31,NADIA,Yes.
14897,L85534,u501,m31,JOHN,Is that everything?
14898,L86097,u501,m31,JOHN,Cash.
14899,L86096,u503,m31,OFFICIAL,How do you want to pay?
14900,L86095,u501,m31,JOHN,Thanks.
14901,L86094,u503,m31,OFFICIAL,You have excellent English.
14902,L86093,u501,m31,JOHN,Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
14903,L86092,u503,m31,OFFICIAL,I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
14904,L86091,u501,m31,JOHN,Is the flight full?
14905,L86910,u516,m32,RONNIE,"Yes, ma'am."
14906,L86909,u505,m32,ANGELA,Then start taking them seriously.
14907,L86908,u516,m32,RONNIE,"Yeah, I know."
14908,L86907,u505,m32,ANGELA,"You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?"
14909,L86906,u516,m32,RONNIE,Just wanted to see.
14910,L86905,u505,m32,ANGELA,What are you doing?
14911,L86898,u511,m32,LAZARUS,I do. God's truth. I do.
14912,L86897,u505,m32,ANGELA,"Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?"
14913,L86896,u511,m32,LAZARUS,"Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away."
14914,L86895,u505,m32,ANGELA,Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
14915,L86894,u511,m32,LAZARUS,I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
14916,L86893,u511,m32,LAZARUS,Can I come in?
14917,L86892,u505,m32,ANGELA,More cough syrup?
14918,L86891,u511,m32,LAZARUS,I need ya help again.
14919,L86890,u505,m32,ANGELA,What do you need?
14920,L86889,u511,m32,LAZARUS,Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
14921,L86888,u505,m32,ANGELA,Hey.
14922,L86761,u511,m32,LAZARUS,"Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy."
14923,L86760,u505,m32,ANGELA,When? Now? Oh. No.
14924,L86759,u511,m32,LAZARUS,You gonna sing me somethin'?
14925,L86758,u505,m32,ANGELA,"Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so..."
14926,L86757,u511,m32,LAZARUS,At church?
14927,L86756,u505,m32,ANGELA,I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
14928,L86731,u505,m32,ANGELA,I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
14929,L86730,u511,m32,LAZARUS,That'd be nice.
14930,L86729,u505,m32,ANGELA,Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
14931,L86728,u511,m32,LAZARUS,You liked what I brung ya?
14932,L86727,u505,m32,ANGELA,I bet you have loyal customers.
14933,L86520,u511,m32,LAZARUS,Well. Hope you enjoy it.
14934,L86519,u505,m32,ANGELA,This was very sweet of you.
14935,L86515,u505,m32,ANGELA,Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
14936,L86514,u511,m32,LAZARUS,"Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank."
14937,L86513,u505,m32,ANGELA,You didn't have to do this.
14938,L86512,u511,m32,LAZARUS,"I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans."
14939,L86337,u511,m32,LAZARUS,Don't make it less true.
14940,L86336,u505,m32,ANGELA,"I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business."
14941,L86335,u511,m32,LAZARUS,Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
14942,L86334,u505,m32,ANGELA,Not if no one finds out.
14943,L86333,u511,m32,LAZARUS,This gonna get you in trouble?
14944,L86332,u505,m32,ANGELA,"My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box."

14976,L86507,u508,m32,ELLA MAE,Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
14977,L86506,u511,m32,LAZARUS,For your hands?
14978,L86505,u508,m32,ELLA MAE,These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.

14985,L86666,u509,m32,GILL,"The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit."
14986,L86665,u516,m32,RONNIE,"It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her..."
14987,L86664,u509,m32,GILL,YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!

14990,L86661,u516,m32,RONNIE,Now wait...
14991,L86660,u509,m32,GILL,And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
14992,L86659,u509,m32,GILL,"You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself."
14993,L86658,u516,m32,RONNIE,"That's not right, really, cuz I..."
14994,L86657,u509,m32,GILL,Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
14995,L86654,u516,m32,RONNIE,"I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run."
14996,L86653,u509,m32,GILL,She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
14997,L86652,u516,m32,RONNIE,"This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it."

15002,L86646,u509,m32,GILL,She's around. Always is.
15003,L86645,u516,m32,RONNIE,I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
15004,L86644,u509,m32,GILL,I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
15005,L86643,u516,m32,RONNIE,"They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home."

15302,L86559,u511,m32,LAZARUS,Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.

15308,L86548,u511,m32,LAZARUS,You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
15309,L86546,u514,m32,R.L.,You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
15310,L86545,u511,m32,LAZARUS,"You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time."
15311,L86544,u514,m32,R.L.,Goin' dove huntin'?
15312,L86543,u514,m32,R.L.,Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
15313,L86542,u511,m32,LAZARUS,This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
15314,L86541,u514,m32,R.L.,You get a call from Rose?
15315,L86540,u511,m32,LAZARUS,"R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place."
15316,L86539,u514,m32,R.L.,Why's his britches round his knees?
15317,L86538,u511,m32,LAZARUS,He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
15318,L86537,u514,m32,R.L.,Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
15319,L86300,u514,m32,R.L.,He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
15320,L86299,u511,m32,LAZARUS,Don't know if God wanna see me.
15321,L86298,u514,m32,R.L.,"I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face."
15322,L86297,u511,m32,LAZARUS,You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
15323,L86296,u514,m32,R.L.,Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
15324,L86135,u511,m32,LAZARUS,"I didn't start this, R.L."
15325,L86134,u514,m32,R.L.,That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
15326,L86133,u511,m32,LAZARUS,I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
15327,L86132,u514,m32,R.L.,"You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind."
15328,L86620,u511,m32,LAZARUS,"Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat."
15329,L86619,u512,m32,LINCOLN,I skipped lunch.
15330,L86583,u511,m32,LAZARUS,"You struck some gold, didn't ya?"
15331,L86582,u512,m32,LINCOLN,Yes'sir.
15332,L86581,u511,m32,LAZARUS,So...  That your first time?
15333,L86580,u511,m32,LAZARUS,"My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?"
15334,L86579,u512,m32,LINCOLN,Please don't tell my daddy.
15335,L86578,u511,m32,LAZARUS,That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
15336,L86577,u512,m32,LINCOLN,Why she got a chain on her?
15337,L86576,u511,m32,LAZARUS,What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
15338,L86199,u512,m32,LINCOLN,"Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said."
15339,L86198,u511,m32,LAZARUS,Keep the change on that.
15340,L86197,u512,m32,LINCOLN,Yes'sir.
15341,L86196,u511,m32,LAZARUS,Get me ten bags of mulch.
15342,L86195,u512,m32,LINCOLN,You won't at the square this mornin'.
15343,L86885,u514,m32,R.L.,"Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel."
15344,L86884,u515,m32,RAE,"It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else."
15345,L86596,u514,m32,R.L.,"I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that."
15346,L86595,u515,m32,RAE,"You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch."
15347,L86594,u514,m32,R.L.,What's on your mind?
15348,L86593,u515,m32,RAE,But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
15349,L86592,u514,m32,R.L.,You could put it that way.
15350,L86591,u515,m32,RAE,"Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven."
15351,L86590,u514,m32,R.L.,That's right.
15352,L86589,u515,m32,RAE,You a preacher?
15353,L86588,u514,m32,R.L.,"So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?"
15354,L86587,u515,m32,RAE,"You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me."
15355,L86586,u514,m32,R.L.,I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
15356,L86585,u515,m32,RAE,Thank you.
15357,L86851,u515,m32,RAE,Ronnie...
15358,L86850,u516,m32,RONNIE,"Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!"
15359,L86849,u516,m32,RONNIE,"Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?"
15360,L86848,u515,m32,RAE,"Ronnie. Please, baby..."
15361,L86847,u516,m32,RONNIE,Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
15362,L86826,u516,m32,RONNIE,"Yeah, I do."
15363,L86825,u515,m32,RAE,I feel better. Do you?
15364,L86821,u515,m32,RAE,All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
15365,L86820,u516,m32,RONNIE,I'm a what?
15366,L86819,u515,m32,RAE,"Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star."
15367,L86818,u516,m32,RONNIE,What?
15368,L86817,u515,m32,RAE,Holy shit!
15369,L86816,u516,m32,RONNIE,No. I just got a messed up stomach.
15370,L86815,u515,m32,RAE,Are you wasted?
15371,L86814,u516,m32,RONNIE,"Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick."
15372,L86813,u515,m32,RAE,"Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'."
15373,L86812,u516,m32,RONNIE,Yeah?
15374,L86811,u515,m32,RAE,I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
15375,L86810,u516,m32,RONNIE,"Yeah, I know."
15376,L86809,u515,m32,RAE,I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
15377,L86808,u516,m32,RONNIE,You feelin' sick?
15378,L86807,u515,m32,RAE,I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
15379,L86806,u515,m32,RAE,You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
15380,L86805,u516,m32,RONNIE,Hey.
15381,L86804,u515,m32,RAE,Hey.
15382,L86119,u516,m32,RONNIE,Rae!
15383,L86118,u515,m32,RAE,It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
15384,L86117,u516,m32,RONNIE,Rae don't do this now...
15385,L86116,u515,m32,RAE,I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
15386,L86115,u516,m32,RONNIE,Rae...
15387,L86114,u515,m32,RAE,This ain't gonna work.
15388,L86751,u518,m32,SANDY,Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
15389,L86750,u515,m32,RAE,But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
15390,L86749,u518,m32,SANDY,"All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that."
15391,L86748,u515,m32,RAE,I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
15392,L86747,u515,m32,RAE,"Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had."
15393,L86746,u518,m32,SANDY,The hell are you talkin' about?
15394,L86745,u515,m32,RAE,"I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all."

15396,L86743,u515,m32,RAE,I just wanted some make-up.
15397,L86742,u518,m32,SANDY,"I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?"
15398,L86741,u515,m32,RAE,"Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?"
15399,L86740,u518,m32,SANDY,You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
15400,L86739,u515,m32,RAE,"No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got."
15401,L86738,u518,m32,SANDY,You need money again?
15402,L86737,u515,m32,RAE,"Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want."
15403,L86736,u518,m32,SANDY,Yeah.
15404,L86735,u515,m32,RAE,Got in a little accident.
15405,L86734,u518,m32,SANDY,What happened to your face?

15409,L86184,u515,m32,RAE,The hell you call me?
15410,L86183,u519,m32,TEHRONNE,"Alright. How much you need, ho?"
15411,L86182,u515,m32,RAE,Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
15412,L86181,u519,m32,TEHRONNE,"Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?"

15703,L87315,u523,m33,JOYCE,I don't give tours.
15704,L87314,u525,m33,NICK,I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
15705,L87313,u523,m33,JOYCE,"An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you."
15706,L87312,u525,m33,NICK,Gaiijin?
15707,L87311,u523,m33,JOYCE,Dead gaiijin's are big news.
15708,L87309,u525,m33,NICK,There was a change in plans.
15709,L87308,u523,m33,JOYCE,Ich said you left.
15710,L87230,u523,m33,JOYCE,He gets as much as he wants.
15711,L87229,u525,m33,NICK,Don't give him any more.
15712,L87584,u524,m33,KOBO,Then take it from him.
15713,L87583,u525,m33,NICK,"Sugai won't give it to me, you know that."
15714,L87579,u524,m33,KOBO,Don't be.
15715,L87578,u525,m33,NICK,I'm amused.
15716,L87577,u524,m33,KOBO,This is my stop.
15717,L87575,u525,m33,NICK,"Time, I've got plenty of."
15718,L87574,u524,m33,KOBO,She's such a long way home for you.
15719,L87573,u525,m33,NICK,Guess I'm on a roll.
15720,L87572,u524,m33,KOBO,"I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky."
15721,L87571,u524,m33,KOBO,You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
15722,L87570,u525,m33,NICK,"Save it, I already took the tour."
15723,L87569,u524,m33,KOBO,Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
15724,L87417,u525,m33,NICK,I'm taking you back.
15725,L87416,u524,m33,KOBO,Keep the change.
15726,L87643,u525,m33,NICK,Right.
15727,L87642,u527,m33,OLIVER,"... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time."
15728,L87291,u527,m33,OLIVER,Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
15729,L87290,u525,m33,NICK,He killed a police officer.
15730,L87289,u527,m33,OLIVER,How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
15731,L87288,u525,m33,NICK,"I planned on catching him, Captain."
15732,L87287,u527,m33,OLIVER,"They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!"
15733,L87286,u525,m33,NICK,He was my partner.
15734,L87285,u527,m33,OLIVER,It's not your job.
15735,L87127,u527,m33,OLIVER,They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
15736,L87126,u525,m33,NICK,Why me?
15737,L87125,u527,m33,OLIVER,"Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country."
15738,L87124,u525,m33,NICK,What...?  What if I say no?
15739,L87123,u527,m33,OLIVER,"You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight."
15740,L87121,u525,m33,NICK,What?
15741,L87120,u527,m33,OLIVER,He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
15742,L87119,u525,m33,NICK,Why?
15743,L87118,u527,m33,OLIVER,Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
15744,L87100,u527,m33,OLIVER,"Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective."
15745,L87099,u525,m33,NICK,Yeah.
15746,L87098,u527,m33,OLIVER,One guy do all the damage?
15747,L87095,u527,m33,OLIVER,The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
15748,L87094,u525,m33,NICK,Not in that company.
15749,L87093,u527,m33,OLIVER,Dope?
15750,L87092,u525,m33,NICK,This by this...
15751,L87091,u527,m33,OLIVER,How big a package we talking about?
15752,L87594,u526,m33,OHASHI,"Goodbye, officer."
15753,L87593,u525,m33,NICK,I have to get to Sugai.
15754,L87592,u526,m33,OHASHI,"-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them."
15755,L87591,u525,m33,NICK,If anything happens to her while I'm here --
15756,L87590,u526,m33,OHASHI,"You had my help, detective."
15757,L87589,u525,m33,NICK,"For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!"
15758,L87588,u526,m33,OHASHI,Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
15759,L87432,u526,m33,OHASHI,"Twenty-four hours, detective."
15760,L87431,u525,m33,NICK,"Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!"
15761,L87428,u526,m33,OHASHI,Look.
15762,L87427,u525,m33,NICK,"While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch."
15763,L87426,u526,m33,OHASHI,Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
15764,L87425,u525,m33,NICK,What's this?
15765,L87259,u525,m33,NICK,"Can we skip the poetry, inspector?"
15766,L87258,u526,m33,OHASHI,"The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here."
15767,L87257,u525,m33,NICK,Because I want you to tell me.
15768,L87256,u526,m33,OHASHI,Why don't you ask your chief detective?
15769,L87255,u525,m33,NICK,Could you fill me in?
15770,L87184,u526,m33,OHASHI,Do you know what this is?
15771,L87183,u525,m33,NICK,"Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this."
15772,L87182,u525,m33,NICK,Work with me.  I want your best detective.
15773,L87181,u526,m33,OHASHI,You're foreigners.
15774,L87180,u525,m33,NICK,We're police officers.
15775,L87179,u526,m33,OHASHI,It is not allowed.
15776,L87178,u525,m33,NICK,I want a gun.
15777,L87177,u525,m33,NICK,"Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents."
15778,L87176,u526,m33,OHASHI,"You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer."
15779,L87561,u525,m33,NICK,After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
15780,L87560,u528,m33,SUGAI,You want him dead too.
15781,L87559,u525,m33,NICK,That wasn't our deal.
15782,L87537,u528,m33,SUGAI,He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
15783,L87536,u525,m33,NICK,Good.
15784,L87518,u525,m33,NICK,I don't have to.
15785,L87517,u528,m33,SUGAI,You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
15786,L87516,u525,m33,NICK,If I say no?
15787,L87515,u528,m33,SUGAI,Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
15788,L87514,u525,m33,NICK,With these?
15789,L87513,u528,m33,SUGAI,I'll pay you.
15790,L87512,u525,m33,NICK,You trust me?
15791,L87511,u528,m33,SUGAI,"The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me."
15792,L87510,u525,m33,NICK,Why tell me this?
15793,L87509,u528,m33,SUGAI,"Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?"
15794,L87508,u525,m33,NICK,The Feds would be onto you in a month.
15795,L87507,u528,m33,SUGAI,Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
15796,L87506,u528,m33,SUGAI,"Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them."
15797,L87505,u525,m33,NICK,The families who control the casinos?
15798,L87504,u528,m33,SUGAI,Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
15799,L87503,u528,m33,SUGAI,He'll be dealt with.
15800,L87502,u525,m33,NICK,I want him.
15801,L87501,u528,m33,SUGAI,"I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired."
15802,L87499,u528,m33,SUGAI,"-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant."
15803,L87498,u525,m33,NICK,I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
15804,L87497,u528,m33,SUGAI,"Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin."
15805,L88357,u529,m34,BATTY,That wouldn't be very sporting.
15806,L88356,u538,m34,MARY,Then go get him.
15807,L88355,u529,m34,BATTY,One man.  He must be good.
15808,L88349,u529,m34,BATTY,"You underestimate the trap, Mary."
15809,L88348,u538,m34,MARY,Not to be trapped.
15810,L88347,u529,m34,BATTY,What's the point?
15811,L88346,u538,m34,MARY,Anywhere.
15812,L88345,u529,m34,BATTY,Where?
15813,L88344,u538,m34,MARY,Let's go while there is still time.
15814,L88238,u529,m34,BATTY,Pris?
15815,L88237,u538,m34,MARY,I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
15816,L88236,u529,m34,BATTY,"I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?"
15817,L88143,u529,m34,BATTY,Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
15818,L88142,u538,m34,MARY,If he won't cooperate?
15819,L88141,u529,m34,BATTY,He knows what he's doing.
15820,L88121,u529,m34,BATTY,Well stocked.
15821,L88120,u538,m34,MARY,You certainly have a nice place here.
15822,L88119,u529,m34,BATTY,We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
15823,L88118,u538,m34,MARY,We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
15824,L88117,u529,m34,BATTY,"Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along..."
15825,L88306,u529,m34,BATTY,Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
15826,L88305,u544,m34,TYRELL,Also extraordinary things.
15827,L88304,u529,m34,BATTY,I've done some questionable things.
15828,L88302,u529,m34,BATTY,I am?
15829,L88301,u544,m34,TYRELL,Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
15830,L88300,u544,m34,TYRELL,"Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last."
15831,L88299,u529,m34,BATTY,But not to last.
15832,L88298,u544,m34,TYRELL,"Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you."
15833,L88297,u529,m34,BATTY,Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
15834,L88296,u544,m34,TYRELL,We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
15835,L88295,u529,m34,BATTY,What about E.M.S. recombination?
15836,L88294,u544,m34,TYRELL,Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
15837,L88293,u529,m34,BATTY,Why?
15838,L88292,u544,m34,TYRELL,"The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established."
15839,L88290,u544,m34,TYRELL,Come here.
15840,L88289,u529,m34,BATTY,"I want more life, fucker."
15841,L88288,u544,m34,TYRELL,I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
15842,L88287,u529,m34,BATTY,Death.
15843,L88286,u544,m34,TYRELL,What's the problem?
15844,L88285,u529,m34,BATTY,Had in mind something a little more radical.
15845,L88284,u544,m34,TYRELL,Would you like to be modified?
15846,L88283,u529,m34,BATTY,Can the maker repair what he makes?
15847,L88282,u544,m34,TYRELL,And what can he do for you?
15848,L88281,u529,m34,BATTY,It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
15849,L88280,u544,m34,TYRELL,I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
15850,L88276,u544,m34,TYRELL,"Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you."
15851,L88275,u529,m34,BATTY,"Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home."
15852,L88271,u544,m34,TYRELL,Oh?
15853,L88270,u529,m34,BATTY,The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
15854,L88352,u529,m34,BATTY,"No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together."
15855,L88351,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Just thought I'd...
15856,L88350,u529,m34,BATTY,"Where are you going, Sebastian?"
15857,L88240,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Thank you.
15858,L88239,u529,m34,BATTY,You're our best and only friend.
15859,L88233,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,This afternoon.
15860,L88232,u529,m34,BATTY,When do you deliver your project?
15861,L88231,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,No.
15862,L88230,u529,m34,BATTY,Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
15863,L88229,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,I'd be happy to mention it to him.
15864,L88228,u529,m34,BATTY,His company made us.
15865,L88227,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,He could?
15866,L88226,u529,m34,BATTY,"Tyrell could help us, Sebastian."
15867,L88225,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
15868,L88224,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Dr. Tyrell?
15869,L88223,u529,m34,BATTY,"What about your friend, the man who owns this building?"
15870,L88222,u529,m34,BATTY,"If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live."
15871,L88221,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,"I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league."
15872,L88220,u529,m34,BATTY,You could help us.
15873,L88219,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Of course not.
15874,L88218,u529,m34,BATTY,"Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet."
15875,L88217,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
15876,L88216,u529,m34,BATTY,We have a lot in common.
15877,L88212,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Like...
15878,L88211,u529,m34,BATTY,Like what?
15879,L88210,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Show me something?
15880,L88207,u529,m34,BATTY,Nexus - 6.
15881,L88206,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,What generation are you?
15882,L88203,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,You're androids.
15883,L88202,u529,m34,BATTY,"What, Sebastian?"
15884,L88201,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,You're just all so... so different.
15885,L88200,u529,m34,BATTY,Why are you staring at us?
15886,L88130,u529,m34,BATTY,"Well, actually"
15887,L88129,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,"Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to."
15888,L88128,u529,m34,BATTY,If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
15889,L88127,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,"How about breakfast, I was just going to make some."
15890,L88125,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,"Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor."
15891,L88124,u529,m34,BATTY,"I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?"
15892,L88359,u529,m34,BATTY,"Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece."
15893,L88358,u539,m34,PRIS,I want to do it.
15894,L88215,u529,m34,BATTY,"Very good, Pris.  Now show him why."
15895,L88214,u539,m34,PRIS,"I think, therefore I am."
15896,L88138,u529,m34,BATTY,Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
15897,L88137,u539,m34,PRIS,Then we're stupid and we'll die.
15898,L88114,u529,m34,BATTY,"Hello, glad to meet you."
15899,L88113,u539,m34,PRIS,"This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian."
15900,L87923,u539,m34,PRIS,"Tomorrow, he says."
15901,L87922,u529,m34,BATTY,When?
15902,L87921,u539,m34,PRIS,He's not ready yet.
15903,L87920,u529,m34,BATTY,What's going on down there?
15904,L88328,u530,m34,BRYANT,Go.
15905,L88327,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yeah.  I got it.
15906,L88326,u530,m34,BRYANT,"If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?"
15907,L88325,u530,m34,BRYANT,"Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire."
15908,L88324,u532,m34,DECKARD,Got it.
15909,L88323,u530,m34,BRYANT,"Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South."
15910,L88322,u532,m34,DECKARD,Who.
15911,L88321,u530,m34,BRYANT,She's not with you?
15912,L88320,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yeah.
15913,L88319,u530,m34,BRYANT,This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
15914,L88318,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yeah.
15915,L88047,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yeah.
15916,L88046,u530,m34,BRYANT,"Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin."
15917,L88044,u530,m34,BRYANT,You didn't like her!?
15918,L88043,u532,m34,DECKARD,I didn't like her.
15919,L88041,u530,m34,BRYANT,Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
15920,L88040,u532,m34,DECKARD,She was gonna get away.
15921,L87960,u530,m34,BRYANT,If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
15922,L87959,u532,m34,DECKARD,I was just about to have my dinner.
15923,L87958,u530,m34,BRYANT,"Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it."
15924,L87957,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yeah.
15925,L87705,u532,m34,DECKARD,Garbage man?
15926,L87704,u530,m34,BRYANT,Industrial refuse.
15927,L87703,u532,m34,DECKARD,What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
15928,L87702,u530,m34,BRYANT,"The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek."
15929,L87701,u532,m34,DECKARD,Where do we start?
15930,L87700,u530,m34,BRYANT,We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
15931,L87699,u532,m34,DECKARD,You got a machine on it yet?
15932,L87698,u530,m34,BRYANT,"There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one."
15933,L87697,u532,m34,DECKARD,What was he after?
15934,L87696,u530,m34,BRYANT,Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
15935,L87695,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Six, huh?"
15936,L87730,u531,m34,CHEW,Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
15937,L87729,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Day after tomorrow.
15938,L87728,u531,m34,CHEW,When might that be?
15939,L87727,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Soon as I finish the job.
15940,L87726,u531,m34,CHEW,"Well, when do you get paid?"
15941,L87722,u531,m34,CHEW,"Your customer, eh?"
15942,L87721,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,It's gotta be right for my customer.
15943,L87971,u534,m34,ESPER,"Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field."
15944,L87970,u532,m34,DECKARD,Number three.
15945,L87969,u534,m34,ESPER,"Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers."
15946,L87968,u532,m34,DECKARD,Next.
15947,L87967,u534,m34,ESPER,"Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position."
15948,L87966,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females."
15949,L87965,u534,m34,ESPER,Longevity is classified.  No.
15950,L87964,u532,m34,DECKARD,Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
15951,L87963,u534,m34,ESPER,Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
15952,L87802,u532,m34,DECKARD,The umbrella.
15953,L87801,u534,m34,ESPER,And what in your estimation works?
15954,L87800,u532,m34,DECKARD,Not if it works.
15955,L87799,u534,m34,ESPER,Do you have something against science?
15956,L87798,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yes?
15957,L87796,u532,m34,DECKARD,I think we're through for the night.
15958,L87795,u534,m34,ESPER,What about a summary then.
15959,L87794,u532,m34,DECKARD,I know all that.
15960,L87793,u534,m34,ESPER,"Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy."
15961,L87765,u534,m34,ESPER,"I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement."
15962,L87764,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Okay, but..."
15963,L87763,u534,m34,ESPER,"Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,"
15964,L87762,u532,m34,DECKARD,How do I stop one?
15965,L87761,u534,m34,ESPER,"The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?"
15966,L87760,u532,m34,DECKARD,You start.
15967,L87759,u534,m34,ESPER,"Why, yes, of course."
15968,L87758,u532,m34,DECKARD,You equipped for random questions?
15969,L87757,u534,m34,ESPER,This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
15970,L87756,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot."
15971,L88088,u532,m34,DECKARD,Four years.
15972,L88087,u537,m34,LEON,"My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?"
15973,L88086,u532,m34,DECKARD,I don't know.
15974,L88085,u537,m34,LEON,How old am I?
15975,L88081,u532,m34,DECKARD,I gotta piss.
15976,L88080,u537,m34,LEON,"One more, eh?"
15977,L88079,u532,m34,DECKARD,I like you too.
15978,L88078,u537,m34,LEON,I like you.
15979,L88076,u532,m34,DECKARD,No thanks.
15980,L88075,u537,m34,LEON,You like to kiss her goodbye.
15981,L88071,u532,m34,DECKARD,Prosit.
15982,L88070,u537,m34,LEON,Prosit.
15983,L88068,u537,m34,LEON,Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
15984,L88067,u532,m34,DECKARD,How long you had these guys?
15985,L88066,u537,m34,LEON,Ya.
15986,L88065,u532,m34,DECKARD,Those cockroaches?
15987,L88064,u537,m34,LEON,No problem.
15988,L88063,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Sorry, don't have the time."
15989,L88062,u537,m34,LEON,You want to see my friends?
15990,L88061,u532,m34,DECKARD,Prosit.
15991,L88060,u537,m34,LEON,Prosit.
15992,L88059,u532,m34,DECKARD,My pleasure.
15993,L88058,u537,m34,LEON,Thank you very much.
15994,L88057,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Shot of vodka, please."
15995,L88056,u537,m34,LEON,Vodka!
15996,L88055,u532,m34,DECKARD,I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
15997,L88054,u537,m34,LEON,But I would like to buy you drink.
15998,L88053,u532,m34,DECKARD,It's okay.  Forget it.
15999,L88052,u537,m34,LEON,I think I have no money.
16000,L88164,u536,m34,HOLDEN,"I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way."
16001,L88163,u532,m34,DECKARD,These aren't just...
16002,L88162,u536,m34,HOLDEN,"Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it."
16003,L88158,u536,m34,HOLDEN,I'm taking a piss.
16004,L88157,u532,m34,DECKARD,What's that?
16005,L88156,u532,m34,DECKARD,I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
16006,L88155,u536,m34,HOLDEN,Let's hear it.
16007,L88154,u532,m34,DECKARD,No.  I got a problem.
16008,L88153,u536,m34,HOLDEN,Money?
16009,L88152,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
16010,L88151,u536,m34,HOLDEN,"From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?"
16011,L88150,u532,m34,DECKARD,I'm doing okay.
16012,L88149,u536,m34,HOLDEN,"Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?"
16013,L88148,u532,m34,DECKARD,Sorry.
16014,L88147,u536,m34,HOLDEN,Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
16015,L88146,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled."
16016,L88145,u536,m34,HOLDEN,"I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?"
16017,L87915,u532,m34,DECKARD,Me too.
16018,L87914,u546,m34,WHEELER,My job is here.
16019,L87913,u532,m34,DECKARD,But if you could?
16020,L87912,u546,m34,WHEELER,Too old.
16021,L87911,u532,m34,DECKARD,Why didn't you go?
16022,L87910,u532,m34,DECKARD,Never been more sure of anything in my life.
16023,L87909,u546,m34,WHEELER,You sure?
16024,L87908,u532,m34,DECKARD,They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
16025,L87907,u546,m34,WHEELER,What if you change your mind?
16026,L87906,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there."
16027,L87905,u546,m34,WHEELER,You're going to be over the limit.
16028,L87904,u532,m34,DECKARD,Nope.
16029,L87903,u546,m34,WHEELER,But you haven't put in for emigration.
16030,L87901,u532,m34,DECKARD,True.
16031,L87900,u546,m34,WHEELER,"Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy."
16032,L87899,u532,m34,DECKARD,Huh huh.
16033,L87898,u546,m34,WHEELER,Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
16034,L87897,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yeah?
16035,L87896,u546,m34,WHEELER,During the road test...
16036,L87895,u546,m34,WHEELER,Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
16037,L87894,u532,m34,DECKARD,Meaning?
16038,L87893,u546,m34,WHEELER,I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
16039,L87892,u532,m34,DECKARD,No rust?
16040,L87891,u546,m34,WHEELER,Nerves of steel.
16041,L87994,u543,m34,TAFFEY,"Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd."
16042,L87993,u532,m34,DECKARD,What shows?
16043,L87992,u543,m34,TAFFEY,"Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties."
16044,L87991,u532,m34,DECKARD,Book the good ones for where?
16045,L87990,u532,m34,DECKARD,You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
16046,L87989,u543,m34,TAFFEY,"That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her."
16047,L87988,u532,m34,DECKARD,What's suck night?
16048,L87987,u543,m34,TAFFEY,I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
16049,L87986,u532,m34,DECKARD,What night?
16050,L87985,u543,m34,TAFFEY,Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
16051,L87984,u532,m34,DECKARD,The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
16052,L87983,u543,m34,TAFFEY,Who?
16053,L87982,u532,m34,DECKARD,What did she want?
16054,L87981,u543,m34,TAFFEY,"This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but..."
16055,L87980,u532,m34,DECKARD,Do you recognize any of them?
16056,L87979,u543,m34,TAFFEY,You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
16057,L87978,u543,m34,TAFFEY,Of course.
16058,L87977,u532,m34,DECKARD,I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
16059,L87975,u532,m34,DECKARD,Can I come in?
16060,L87974,u543,m34,TAFFEY,Yes?
16061,L87973,u532,m34,DECKARD,Taffey Lewis?
16062,L88029,u541,m34,SALOME,And who do I go to about you?
16063,L88028,u532,m34,DECKARD,Me.
16064,L88026,u532,m34,DECKARD,Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
16065,L88025,u541,m34,SALOME,I bet I would.
16066,L88024,u532,m34,DECKARD,You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
16067,L88022,u541,m34,SALOME,"Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?"
16068,L88021,u532,m34,DECKARD,Sorry.
16069,L88020,u541,m34,SALOME,Jeezus!
16070,L88019,u541,m34,SALOME,Come on.
16071,L88018,u532,m34,DECKARD,Does it eat?
16072,L88017,u541,m34,SALOME,The best.
16073,L88016,u541,m34,SALOME,You mean the snake.
16074,L88015,u532,m34,DECKARD,It's a good job.
16075,L88014,u541,m34,SALOME,Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
16076,L88013,u532,m34,DECKARD,It that mother real?
16077,L88011,u532,m34,DECKARD,For holes.
16078,L88010,u541,m34,SALOME,What the fuck for?
16079,L88009,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could."
16080,L88008,u541,m34,SALOME,Are you for real?
16081,L88007,u532,m34,DECKARD,Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
16082,L88006,u541,m34,SALOME,How do you mean 'exploited'?
16083,L88005,u532,m34,DECKARD,You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
16084,L88004,u541,m34,SALOME,I don't know nothing about it.
16085,L88003,u532,m34,DECKARD,There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
16086,L88000,u532,m34,DECKARD,I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
16087,L87999,u541,m34,SALOME,Yeah?
16088,L88340,u540,m34,RACHAEL,That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
16089,L88339,u532,m34,DECKARD,What?
16090,L88338,u540,m34,RACHAEL,You know what I think?
16091,L88337,u532,m34,DECKARD,Just wait here.
16092,L88336,u540,m34,RACHAEL,What difference will it make?
16093,L88335,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone."
16094,L88334,u532,m34,DECKARD,"No, I don't."
16095,L88333,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
16096,L88332,u532,m34,DECKARD,Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
16097,L88331,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
16098,L88330,u532,m34,DECKARD,Because it's not.
16099,L88329,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?"
16100,L88317,u532,m34,DECKARD,Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
16101,L88316,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Ten years.
16102,L88315,u532,m34,DECKARD,What's a long time?
16103,L88314,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Uh-huh.
16104,L88313,u532,m34,DECKARD,You mean a woman?
16105,L88312,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Have you ever known anybody a long time?
16106,L88260,u532,m34,DECKARD,I never felt better.
16107,L88259,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"You're sick, Deckard."
16108,L88258,u532,m34,DECKARD,Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
16109,L88257,u540,m34,RACHAEL,This feels stupid.
16110,L88254,u532,m34,DECKARD,I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
16111,L88253,u540,m34,RACHAEL,But then how can you...
16112,L88252,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Never mind the plug, just go through the motions."
16113,L88251,u540,m34,RACHAEL,But if I don't plug it in how can I...
16114,L88248,u532,m34,DECKARD,I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
16115,L88247,u540,m34,RACHAEL,They could clean around the arrangement.
16116,L88245,u540,m34,RACHAEL,It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
16117,L88244,u532,m34,DECKARD,Don't be fooled by appearances.
16118,L88243,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
16119,L88242,u532,m34,DECKARD,Hmmm?
16120,L88241,u540,m34,RACHAEL,When was the last time you cleaned this place?
16121,L88198,u540,m34,RACHAEL,I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
16122,L88197,u532,m34,DECKARD,Like?
16123,L88196,u540,m34,RACHAEL,I don't know... I think I missed something.
16124,L88195,u532,m34,DECKARD,What?
16125,L88194,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it."
16126,L88193,u532,m34,DECKARD,"It wasn't very good last night, was it?"
16127,L88192,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
16128,L88191,u540,m34,RACHAEL,That's another thing I can't do.
16129,L88190,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yeah.
16130,L88189,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Did you cry when your father died?
16131,L88186,u540,m34,RACHAEL,I wish I could.
16132,L88185,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yeah.  Sometimes.
16133,L88184,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Do you dream?
16134,L88183,u532,m34,DECKARD,"If they are smart, they take naps."
16135,L88182,u540,m34,RACHAEL,What do people do in the afternoon?
16136,L88181,u532,m34,DECKARD,Not too good.
16137,L88180,u540,m34,RACHAEL,How are you doing?
16138,L88179,u532,m34,DECKARD,I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
16139,L88178,u540,m34,RACHAEL,How come you're not on the job?
16140,L88177,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Oh.
16141,L88176,u532,m34,DECKARD,Dead.
16142,L88175,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Where is he?
16143,L88174,u532,m34,DECKARD,Me and my dad.
16144,L88173,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Who is this?
16145,L88171,u540,m34,RACHAEL,You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
16146,L88170,u532,m34,DECKARD,You did?
16147,L88169,u540,m34,RACHAEL,I told you I'd come back.
16148,L88104,u540,m34,RACHAEL,There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
16149,L88103,u532,m34,DECKARD,You ever take a bath with a man before?
16150,L88101,u532,m34,DECKARD,Sit.
16151,L88100,u540,m34,RACHAEL,What do you want me to do?
16152,L88099,u532,m34,DECKARD,Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
16153,L87950,u532,m34,DECKARD,Right.
16154,L87949,u540,m34,RACHAEL,They probably want to find out when they were made.
16155,L87946,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Can you?  I couldn't.
16156,L87945,u532,m34,DECKARD,I can imagine.
16157,L87943,u540,m34,RACHAEL,I'm sorry.
16158,L87942,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yeah.
16159,L87941,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Do I make you nervous?
16160,L87939,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me."
16161,L87938,u532,m34,DECKARD,So?
16162,L87937,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"You use your equipment, don't you?"
16163,L87935,u532,m34,DECKARD,I work alone.
16164,L87934,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Two of us might be more effective than one.
16165,L87933,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no."
16166,L87932,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it."
16167,L87931,u540,m34,RACHAEL,I think you need more help than you've got.
16168,L87930,u532,m34,DECKARD,I've already got more help than I need.
16169,L87929,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help."
16170,L87928,u532,m34,DECKARD,Is there anything else?
16171,L87860,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Ugh.
16172,L87859,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters."
16173,L87858,u532,m34,DECKARD,Sounds like you speaks from experience.
16174,L87857,u540,m34,RACHAEL,It would be my child.
16175,L87856,u532,m34,DECKARD,In your opinion.
16176,L87855,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"That would be murder, Mr. Deckard."
16177,L87854,u532,m34,DECKARD,Why not?
16178,L87853,u540,m34,RACHAEL,I'd never get an abortion.
16179,L87852,u532,m34,DECKARD,"You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion."
16180,L87848,u532,m34,DECKARD,You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
16181,L87847,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
16182,L87846,u532,m34,DECKARD,In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
16183,L87845,u540,m34,RACHAEL,I'd kill it.
16184,L87844,u532,m34,DECKARD,You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
16185,L87843,u540,m34,RACHAEL,I'd take him to the doctor.
16186,L87842,u532,m34,DECKARD,"You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar."
16187,L87841,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police."
16188,L87817,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share."
16189,L87816,u532,m34,DECKARD,Why should I be?
16190,L87815,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Are you apprehensive?
16191,L87813,u540,m34,RACHAEL,Of course not.
16192,L87812,u532,m34,DECKARD,It's artificial?
16193,L87810,u540,m34,RACHAEL,"But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?"
16194,L87809,u532,m34,DECKARD,"A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem."
16195,L87808,u540,m34,RACHAEL,It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
16196,L87690,u532,m34,DECKARD,I'll see you in a minute.
16197,L87689,u535,m34,GAFF,Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
16198,L87688,u532,m34,DECKARD,Bad?
16199,L87687,u535,m34,GAFF,Holden got hit.
16200,L87686,u532,m34,DECKARD,What's up?
16201,L87685,u535,m34,GAFF,"Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is."
16202,L87684,u532,m34,DECKARD,You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
16203,L87683,u535,m34,GAFF,Where the hell you been?
16204,L87879,u544,m34,TYRELL,"All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced."
16205,L87878,u532,m34,DECKARD,Discreetly.
16206,L87877,u544,m34,TYRELL,And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
16207,L87872,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Five, maybe six."
16208,L87871,u544,m34,TYRELL,"How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?"
16209,L87870,u544,m34,TYRELL,Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
16210,L87869,u532,m34,DECKARD,She didn't know?
16211,L87868,u532,m34,DECKARD,Thirteen.
16212,L87867,u544,m34,TYRELL,How many questions did it take?
16213,L87866,u544,m34,TYRELL,The machine works.  She is.
16214,L87865,u532,m34,DECKARD,"If she is, the machine works."
16215,L87864,u544,m34,TYRELL,Well?
16216,L87837,u544,m34,TYRELL,Sitting next to you.
16217,L87836,u532,m34,DECKARD,One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
16218,L87835,u544,m34,TYRELL,"Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?"
16219,L87834,u532,m34,DECKARD,"Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof."
16220,L87833,u544,m34,TYRELL,But in your profession that is a risk.
16221,L87832,u532,m34,DECKARD,No.
16222,L87831,u544,m34,TYRELL,Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
16223,L87830,u532,m34,DECKARD,Go ahead.
16224,L87829,u544,m34,TYRELL,May I ask a personal question?
16225,L87828,u544,m34,TYRELL,"Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?"
16226,L87827,u532,m34,DECKARD,Yes.
16227,L87826,u544,m34,TYRELL,Is this to be an empathy test?
16228,L87824,u532,m34,DECKARD,Please.
16229,L87823,u544,m34,TYRELL,Black?
16230,L87822,u532,m34,DECKARD,Thanks.
16231,L87889,u545,m34,VOICE,Almost through.
16232,L87888,u533,m34,DECKARD'S VOICE,I'm tired of this.
16233,L87887,u545,m34,VOICE,"You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading."
16234,L87886,u533,m34,DECKARD'S VOICE,How do you know I'm not?
16235,L87885,u545,m34,VOICE,"We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate."
16236,L87883,u533,m34,DECKARD'S VOICE,Sorry.
16237,L87882,u545,m34,VOICE,"Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard."
16238,L87677,u536,m34,HOLDEN,"I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?"
16239,L87676,u537,m34,LEON,"Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?"
16240,L87673,u536,m34,HOLDEN,"You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon."
16241,L87672,u537,m34,LEON,But I understand what you mean.
16242,L87671,u537,m34,LEON,I never seen a turtle.
16243,L87670,u536,m34,HOLDEN,Same thing.
16244,L87669,u537,m34,LEON,Of course.
16245,L87668,u536,m34,HOLDEN,Know what a turtle is?
16246,L87667,u537,m34,LEON,A tortoise.  What's that?
16247,L87666,u536,m34,HOLDEN,"Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you..."
16248,L87665,u537,m34,LEON,But how come I'd be there?
16249,L87664,u536,m34,HOLDEN,Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
16250,L87663,u537,m34,LEON,What desert?
16251,L87662,u536,m34,HOLDEN,What?
16252,L87661,u537,m34,LEON,What one?
16253,L87660,u536,m34,HOLDEN,"You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a..."
16254,L87659,u536,m34,HOLDEN,"Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can."
16255,L87658,u537,m34,LEON,Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
16256,L87657,u537,m34,LEON,Sorry.
16257,L87656,u536,m34,HOLDEN,Don't move.
16258,L87655,u537,m34,LEON,I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
16259,L88205,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,You're all so perfect.
16260,L88204,u539,m34,PRIS,What makes you think so?
16261,L88123,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,I keep a lot of provisions right here.
16262,L88122,u539,m34,PRIS,Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
16263,L87789,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Good.
16264,L87788,u539,m34,PRIS,"As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow."
16265,L87787,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,"Ah, you get hold of your friends?"
16266,L87785,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
16267,L87784,u539,m34,PRIS,Is that why you're still here?
16268,L87783,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,My glands.  They grow old too fast.
16269,L87782,u539,m34,PRIS,What's that?
16270,L87781,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Methuselah Syndrome.
16271,L87780,u539,m34,PRIS,What's your problem?
16272,L87779,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Twenty.
16273,L87776,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,"Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now..."
16274,L87775,u539,m34,PRIS,And you live in this building all by yourself?
16275,L87774,u539,m34,PRIS,Thanks.
16276,L87773,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Beautiful.
16277,L87772,u539,m34,PRIS,Just better.
16278,L87771,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,You look... better.
16279,L87769,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,You scared me.
16280,L87768,u539,m34,PRIS,Whatcha doin'?
16281,L87755,u539,m34,PRIS,I was hoping you'd say that.
16282,L87754,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
16283,L87753,u539,m34,PRIS,"I'm hungry, J.F."
16284,L87752,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,We sure did.
16285,L87751,u539,m34,PRIS,We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
16286,L87749,u539,m34,PRIS,"I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying."
16287,L87748,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,What about friends?
16288,L87747,u539,m34,PRIS,They left.
16289,L87746,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Where are your folks?
16290,L87745,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Oh.
16291,L87744,u539,m34,PRIS,I don't have one.
16292,L87743,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,You want to go home?
16293,L87741,u539,m34,PRIS,Hi.
16294,L87740,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
16295,L87739,u539,m34,PRIS,Pris.
16296,L87738,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,What's your name?
16297,L87735,u539,m34,PRIS,I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
16298,L87734,u542,m34,SEBASTIAN,How come you were in my truck?
16299,L93293,u560,m35,MISS SWEET,Sure.
16300,L93292,u547,m35,ADAM,She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
16301,L93291,u560,m35,MISS SWEET,Your mom was a dancer?
16302,L93290,u547,m35,ADAM,"No, I'm not! My mom taught me."
16303,L93289,u560,m35,MISS SWEET,You're kidding!
16304,L93286,u547,m35,ADAM,Really?
16305,L93285,u560,m35,MISS SWEET,We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
16306,L93280,u560,m35,MISS SWEET,He's really funny!
16307,L93279,u547,m35,ADAM,I'm Adam Webber.
16308,L93278,u560,m35,MISS SWEET,This is my new friend...
16309,L93277,u547,m35,ADAM,Thank-Q!
16310,L93276,u560,m35,MISS SWEET,Bravo!
16311,L93275,u547,m35,ADAM,You like it?
16312,L93274,u560,m35,MISS SWEET,"Oh, now, that's a great one!"
16313,L93273,u547,m35,ADAM,I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
16314,L93272,u560,m35,MISS SWEET,Yes?
16315,L93271,u547,m35,ADAM,Hi!
16316,L93482,u548,m35,ARON,"Young man, stop right there!"
16317,L93481,u547,m35,ADAM,The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
16318,L93463,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, ma'am."
16319,L93462,u548,m35,ARON,"Let's go talk first, Adam."
16320,L93457,u547,m35,ADAM,"I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow."
16321,L93456,u548,m35,ARON,"Well, that depends..."
16322,L93455,u547,m35,ADAM,For how long?
16323,L93454,u548,m35,ARON,My office.
16324,L93453,u547,m35,ADAM,Come where?
16325,L93452,u548,m35,ARON,We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
16326,L93450,u548,m35,ARON,"Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown."
16327,L93449,u547,m35,ADAM,Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
16328,L93448,u548,m35,ARON,"Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life."
16329,L93447,u547,m35,ADAM,How do you do?
16330,L93446,u548,m35,ARON,"I'm Nina Aron, Adam."
16331,L93342,u555,m35,CLIFF,Eve? I'm leaving.
16332,L93341,u547,m35,ADAM,It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
16333,L93340,u555,m35,CLIFF,Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
16334,L93334,u555,m35,CLIFF,Do ya?
16335,L93333,u547,m35,ADAM,"Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself."
16336,L93330,u555,m35,CLIFF,Shallow? I'm shallow?!
16337,L93329,u547,m35,ADAM,"I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?"
16338,L93328,u555,m35,CLIFF,What?!
16339,L93327,u547,m35,ADAM,"Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?"
16340,L93326,u555,m35,CLIFF,"Oh, brother..."
16341,L93325,u547,m35,ADAM,Please excuse this interruption.
16342,L93320,u555,m35,CLIFF,How 'bout a drink at the bar?
16343,L93319,u547,m35,ADAM,"Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--"
16344,L93318,u555,m35,CLIFF,But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
16345,L93046,u555,m35,CLIFF,"I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?"
16346,L93045,u547,m35,ADAM,How do you do?
16347,L93595,u547,m35,ADAM,My mother's like that.
16348,L93594,u556,m35,EVE,"We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!"
16349,L93593,u547,m35,ADAM,"See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?"
16350,L93592,u556,m35,EVE,No.
16351,L93461,u547,m35,ADAM,"Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again."
16352,L93460,u556,m35,EVE,...I do.
16353,L93459,u547,m35,ADAM,"...All right, Eve.  If you say so."
16354,L93458,u556,m35,EVE,Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
16355,L93445,u556,m35,EVE,"Hi, Adam.  This is, uh...."
16356,L93444,u547,m35,ADAM,"Hi, Eve!"
16357,L93427,u556,m35,EVE,Neat. Goodnight!
16358,L93426,u547,m35,ADAM,And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
16359,L93425,u556,m35,EVE,Really?  Okay!
16360,L93424,u547,m35,ADAM,It was at least as good as the sky.
16361,L93423,u556,m35,EVE,My pleasure.
16362,L93422,u547,m35,ADAM,Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
16363,L93421,u556,m35,EVE,That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
16364,L93420,u547,m35,ADAM,Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
16365,L93419,u556,m35,EVE,I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
16366,L93418,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, Eve?"
16367,L93417,u556,m35,EVE,Uh-huh. Adam?
16368,L93414,u547,m35,ADAM,No.
16369,L93413,u556,m35,EVE,"Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?"
16370,L93412,u547,m35,ADAM,"""All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live.""  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves."
16371,L93411,u556,m35,EVE,Sing it to me.
16372,L93410,u547,m35,ADAM,"But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called ""On the Street Where You Live.""  You know it?"
16373,L93409,u556,m35,EVE,Is that what you call it?
16374,L93408,u547,m35,ADAM,I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
16375,L93406,u547,m35,ADAM,Thanks.
16376,L93405,u556,m35,EVE,There.
16377,L93403,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, you had better!!"
16378,L93402,u547,m35,ADAM,I know first aid!
16379,L93401,u556,m35,EVE,Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
16380,L93400,u547,m35,ADAM,"Eve, if you'll let me, I can --"
16381,L93399,u556,m35,EVE,Goodnight!
16382,L93398,u547,m35,ADAM,What?
16383,L93397,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!"
16384,L93396,u547,m35,ADAM,I know...and I'm really sorry.
16385,L93395,u556,m35,EVE,What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
16386,L93394,u547,m35,ADAM,I'm really sorry!
16387,L93393,u556,m35,EVE,"Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!"
16388,L93392,u547,m35,ADAM,Eve?!
16389,L93348,u556,m35,EVE,And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
16390,L93347,u547,m35,ADAM,"But, Eve, I would--"
16391,L93346,u556,m35,EVE,"I'm leaving, too."
16392,L93344,u547,m35,ADAM,"Eve, I'm sorry."
16393,L93343,u556,m35,EVE,I don't blame you!
16394,L93339,u547,m35,ADAM,I'm sorry.
16395,L93338,u556,m35,EVE,Adam?!
16396,L93314,u547,m35,ADAM,All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
16397,L93313,u556,m35,EVE,I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
16398,L93312,u547,m35,ADAM,No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
16399,L93311,u556,m35,EVE,You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
16400,L93310,u547,m35,ADAM,"I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied."
16401,L93309,u556,m35,EVE,Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
16402,L93308,u547,m35,ADAM,Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
16403,L93307,u556,m35,EVE,"You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!"
16404,L93306,u547,m35,ADAM,You wanted to see me!
16405,L93268,u556,m35,EVE,Did you?
16406,L93267,u547,m35,ADAM,Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
16407,L93266,u556,m35,EVE,What?
16408,L93263,u556,m35,EVE,"Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be."
16409,L93262,u547,m35,ADAM,Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
16410,L93261,u556,m35,EVE,"Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me."
16411,L93259,u556,m35,EVE,Maybe. But that's how it works.
16412,L93258,u547,m35,ADAM,That's ridiculous.
16413,L93257,u556,m35,EVE,"Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off ""you can't have me"" signals!"
16414,L93256,u547,m35,ADAM,Really?
16415,L93253,u547,m35,ADAM,What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
16416,L93252,u556,m35,EVE,"Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it."
16417,L93251,u547,m35,ADAM,Okay. I like that.
16418,L93246,u547,m35,ADAM,How 'bout this one?
16419,L93245,u556,m35,EVE,"Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!"
16420,L93244,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you."
16421,L93243,u556,m35,EVE,"Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what ""bitch"" means, don't you?"
16422,L93242,u547,m35,ADAM,Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
16423,L93241,u556,m35,EVE,No way.
16424,L93240,u547,m35,ADAM,What about her?
16425,L93239,u547,m35,ADAM,"It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told."
16426,L93238,u556,m35,EVE,What have you ordered?
16427,L93237,u556,m35,EVE,And don't be so obvious!
16428,L93236,u547,m35,ADAM,I like her.
16429,L93235,u556,m35,EVE,Not that one!
16430,L93234,u547,m35,ADAM,I thought I was here to meet women.
16431,L93232,u547,m35,ADAM,Good-bye!
16432,L93231,u556,m35,EVE,Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
16433,L93211,u556,m35,EVE,Yes!
16434,L93210,u547,m35,ADAM,Do I look crazy?
16435,L93209,u556,m35,EVE,No!  Not crazy!
16436,L93205,u556,m35,EVE,Look unimpressed.
16437,L93204,u547,m35,ADAM,My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
16438,L93197,u556,m35,EVE,Well...yeah. Okay.
16439,L93196,u547,m35,ADAM,Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
16440,L93195,u556,m35,EVE,"Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--"
16441,L93194,u547,m35,ADAM,Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
16442,L93193,u556,m35,EVE,Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
16443,L93192,u547,m35,ADAM,No it's not!
16444,L93191,u556,m35,EVE,"Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?"
16445,L93190,u547,m35,ADAM,I certainly do!
16446,L93189,u556,m35,EVE,"Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?"
16447,L93188,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that."
16448,L93187,u556,m35,EVE,"Have you ever heard the saying, ""He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"""
16449,L93186,u547,m35,ADAM,"Hey, Eve!"
16450,L93179,u547,m35,ADAM,Okay!
16451,L93178,u556,m35,EVE,He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
16452,L93166,u547,m35,ADAM,"It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!"
16453,L93165,u556,m35,EVE,What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
16454,L93162,u547,m35,ADAM,"Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo."
16455,L93161,u556,m35,EVE,Yeah.
16456,L93160,u547,m35,ADAM,About clothing?
16457,L93151,u556,m35,EVE,That's boring!
16458,L93150,u547,m35,ADAM,The guy with the underpants!
16459,L93140,u556,m35,EVE,"Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?"
16460,L93139,u547,m35,ADAM,The what?
16461,L93136,u556,m35,EVE,"So, what are you seeing?"
16462,L93135,u547,m35,ADAM,All right.
16463,L93111,u556,m35,EVE,Uh...yeah.
16464,L93110,u547,m35,ADAM,May I please be excused?
16465,L93109,u556,m35,EVE,"No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there."
16466,L93108,u547,m35,ADAM,In the house?
16467,L93107,u556,m35,EVE,Sure.
16468,L93106,u547,m35,ADAM,He has a computer?
16469,L93105,u556,m35,EVE,He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
16470,L93104,u547,m35,ADAM,Where's he gone?
16471,L93093,u547,m35,ADAM,Good for you.
16472,L93092,u556,m35,EVE,"Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way."
16473,L93085,u547,m35,ADAM,Wow.
16474,L93084,u556,m35,EVE,You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
16475,L93083,u547,m35,ADAM,Yes!
16476,L93082,u556,m35,EVE,I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
16477,L93081,u547,m35,ADAM,Um-hum.
16478,L93080,u556,m35,EVE,"Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?"
16479,L93065,u547,m35,ADAM,"Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!"
16480,L93064,u556,m35,EVE,I thought only hookers drank those things.
16481,L93063,u547,m35,ADAM,Thank-Q!
16482,L93062,u556,m35,EVE,Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
16483,L93052,u556,m35,EVE,What?!
16484,L93051,u547,m35,ADAM,"Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants."
16485,L93050,u556,m35,EVE,"He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?"
16486,L93049,u547,m35,ADAM,"Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?"
16487,L93036,u547,m35,ADAM,I like it.
16488,L93035,u556,m35,EVE,Yes!
16489,L93034,u547,m35,ADAM,Is this your house?
16490,L93033,u556,m35,EVE,I was wrong!!
16491,L93032,u547,m35,ADAM,You said it would be easy!
16492,L93031,u556,m35,EVE,Never drive again!
16493,L93030,u547,m35,ADAM,I told you I've never driven before!
16494,L93029,u556,m35,EVE,You almost got us killed!
16495,L93028,u547,m35,ADAM,Sorry!
16496,L93027,u556,m35,EVE,Stop that ma'am crap!
16497,L93026,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, ma'am!"
16498,L93025,u556,m35,EVE,"Now, get out!!"
16499,L93024,u547,m35,ADAM,The engine is still running.
16500,L93023,u556,m35,EVE,Get out!
16501,L93022,u556,m35,EVE,Thank you.
16502,L93021,u547,m35,ADAM,Of course.
16503,L93020,u556,m35,EVE,Could we talk about that a little later?
16504,L93018,u547,m35,ADAM,That's what I was afraid of.
16505,L93017,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time."
16506,L93016,u547,m35,ADAM,Two weeks.
16507,L93015,u556,m35,EVE,When do you need her by?
16508,L93014,u547,m35,ADAM,"And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena."
16509,L93013,u556,m35,EVE,"No dogs, huh? Okay."
16510,L93012,u547,m35,ADAM,One who's not a mutant.
16511,L93011,u556,m35,EVE,I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
16512,L93010,u547,m35,ADAM,It didn't used to be that way.
16513,L93009,u556,m35,EVE,Everybody's divorced.
16514,L93008,u547,m35,ADAM,They're all divorced?
16515,L93007,u556,m35,EVE,Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
16516,L93006,u547,m35,ADAM,I didn't know that.
16517,L93005,u556,m35,EVE,Sure.
16518,L93004,u547,m35,ADAM,It does?
16519,L93003,u556,m35,EVE,The big one!
16520,L93002,u547,m35,ADAM,Bites what?
16521,L93001,u556,m35,EVE,You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
16522,L93000,u547,m35,ADAM,I don't want to be alone.
16523,L92999,u556,m35,EVE,Why?!
16524,L92998,u547,m35,ADAM,Because I want to get married.
16525,L92997,u556,m35,EVE,What for?
16526,L92996,u547,m35,ADAM,Yes.
16527,L92995,u556,m35,EVE,A wife?
16528,L92994,u547,m35,ADAM,Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
16529,L92993,u556,m35,EVE,Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
16530,L92992,u547,m35,ADAM,This is for me.
16531,L92991,u556,m35,EVE,"No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?"
16532,L92990,u547,m35,ADAM,Then forget it.
16533,L92989,u556,m35,EVE,"Oh, I'm sure it will!"
16534,L92988,u547,m35,ADAM,"Well, this is going to sound a little crazy."
16535,L92987,u556,m35,EVE,Name it.
16536,L92986,u547,m35,ADAM,There's something else I would like you to help me with.
16537,L92985,u556,m35,EVE,"Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat."
16538,L92984,u547,m35,ADAM,Okay.
16539,L92983,u556,m35,EVE,"Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?"
16540,L92982,u547,m35,ADAM,"And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh..."
16541,L92981,u556,m35,EVE,Thank you.
16542,L92980,u547,m35,ADAM,"You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you."
16543,L92979,u556,m35,EVE,No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
16544,L92978,u547,m35,ADAM,I guess we'll need another locker.
16545,L92977,u556,m35,EVE,"It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy."
16546,L92976,u547,m35,ADAM,We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
16547,L92974,u556,m35,EVE,Night!
16548,L92973,u547,m35,ADAM,"Hey, you know. I was thinking..."
16549,L92972,u556,m35,EVE,Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
16550,L92971,u547,m35,ADAM,Sorry.
16551,L92970,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!"
16552,L92969,u556,m35,EVE,What?
16553,L92968,u547,m35,ADAM,Wait! Wait!
16554,L92966,u547,m35,ADAM,Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
16555,L92965,u556,m35,EVE,"Very funny, smart ass."
16556,L92964,u547,m35,ADAM,My Mom and Dad.
16557,L92963,u556,m35,EVE,Who are these people?
16558,L92962,u547,m35,ADAM,They like Dr. Pepper.
16559,L92961,u556,m35,EVE,Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
16560,L92955,u556,m35,EVE,Sure.
16561,L92954,u547,m35,ADAM,You got it! Wait here while I change.
16562,L92953,u556,m35,EVE,I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
16563,L92952,u547,m35,ADAM,What's fair?
16564,L92951,u556,m35,EVE,What's the pay?
16565,L92950,u547,m35,ADAM,Two weeks.
16566,L92949,u556,m35,EVE,How long would you need me?
16567,L92948,u547,m35,ADAM,"Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help."
16568,L92947,u556,m35,EVE,Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
16569,L92946,u547,m35,ADAM,Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
16570,L92945,u556,m35,EVE,Doing what?
16571,L92944,u547,m35,ADAM,Why not go to work for me?
16572,L92943,u556,m35,EVE,"It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is."
16573,L92942,u547,m35,ADAM,...Okay.
16574,L92941,u556,m35,EVE,Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
16575,L92940,u547,m35,ADAM,Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
16576,L92939,u556,m35,EVE,What?
16577,L92938,u547,m35,ADAM,Why doesn't it never work out?
16578,L92937,u556,m35,EVE,"See, ya."
16579,L92936,u547,m35,ADAM,Cross my heart and hope to die.
16580,L92935,u556,m35,EVE,"Hey, no kidding?  In color?"
16581,L92934,u547,m35,ADAM,Watching television in color.
16582,L92933,u556,m35,EVE,"The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?"
16583,L92932,u547,m35,ADAM,I think it's the eyes.
16584,L92931,u556,m35,EVE,"Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above."
16585,L92930,u547,m35,ADAM,Thank-Q!
16586,L92929,u556,m35,EVE,No.
16587,L92928,u547,m35,ADAM,Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
16588,L92926,u556,m35,EVE,Okay!  Damn!
16589,L92925,u547,m35,ADAM,Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
16590,L92924,u556,m35,EVE,I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
16591,L92923,u556,m35,EVE,Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
16592,L92922,u547,m35,ADAM,"Wait, Eve, please!  Wait."
16593,L92921,u556,m35,EVE,"Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit."
16594,L92920,u547,m35,ADAM,I haven't brushed yet.
16595,L92919,u556,m35,EVE,Why are you doing that?
16596,L92918,u547,m35,ADAM,Okay.
16597,L92917,u556,m35,EVE,Take it. damn it!
16598,L92916,u547,m35,ADAM,"I can't, it's yours."
16599,L92915,u556,m35,EVE,"Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it."
16600,L92914,u547,m35,ADAM,I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
16601,L92880,u547,m35,ADAM,Right.
16602,L92879,u556,m35,EVE,"Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase."
16603,L92878,u547,m35,ADAM,That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
16604,L92876,u556,m35,EVE,I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
16605,L92875,u547,m35,ADAM,Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
16606,L92874,u556,m35,EVE,I know a short-cut.
16607,L92873,u547,m35,ADAM,"Hey, what are you doing?!"
16608,L92872,u556,m35,EVE,You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
16609,L92871,u547,m35,ADAM,Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
16610,L92870,u556,m35,EVE,Over this?
16611,L92869,u547,m35,ADAM,"Oh, I could die..."
16612,L92868,u556,m35,EVE,How's that?
16613,L92867,u556,m35,EVE,"Okay, okay!  Take it easy!"
16614,L92866,u547,m35,ADAM,Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
16615,L92865,u556,m35,EVE,Perry?
16616,L92864,u547,m35,ADAM,It's Perry!
16617,L92863,u556,m35,EVE,What is it?!
16618,L92862,u547,m35,ADAM,Wait!  Wait!
16619,L92861,u556,m35,EVE,Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
16620,L92860,u547,m35,ADAM,It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
16621,L92859,u556,m35,EVE,"So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?"
16622,L92858,u556,m35,EVE,Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
16623,L92857,u547,m35,ADAM,"Heck, no!  What?!"
16624,L92856,u556,m35,EVE,I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
16625,L92855,u547,m35,ADAM,Yes.
16626,L92854,u556,m35,EVE,And that's it?
16627,L92853,u547,m35,ADAM,Yes.
16628,L92852,u556,m35,EVE,"So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?"
16629,L92851,u547,m35,ADAM,"So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too."
16630,L92850,u556,m35,EVE,Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
16631,L92849,u547,m35,ADAM,He's all yours. I was holding him back.
16632,L92848,u556,m35,EVE,Rogers Hornsby?!?
16633,L92847,u547,m35,ADAM,"Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!"
16634,L92846,u556,m35,EVE,Get away from me!!
16635,L92845,u547,m35,ADAM,"I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!"
16636,L92844,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!"
16637,L92843,u547,m35,ADAM,Nope.
16638,L92842,u556,m35,EVE,You don't?
16639,L92841,u547,m35,ADAM,"If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun."
16640,L92840,u556,m35,EVE,"I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car."
16641,L92839,u547,m35,ADAM,Do you own a car?
16642,L92838,u556,m35,EVE,"Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on."
16643,L92837,u547,m35,ADAM,It was amazing.
16644,L92836,u556,m35,EVE,"See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!"
16645,L92835,u547,m35,ADAM,Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
16646,L92834,u556,m35,EVE,Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
16647,L92833,u547,m35,ADAM,Again.
16648,L92832,u556,m35,EVE,"I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?"
16649,L92831,u547,m35,ADAM,Right.
16650,L92830,u556,m35,EVE,"Yes, I'm right?"
16651,L92829,u547,m35,ADAM,So far?
16652,L92828,u556,m35,EVE,"Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?"
16653,L92827,u547,m35,ADAM,"Oh, that's nice."
16654,L92826,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing."
16655,L92825,u547,m35,ADAM,I don't know. Why doesn't it?
16656,L92824,u556,m35,EVE,Why doesn't that surprise me?
16657,L92823,u547,m35,ADAM,I came on a bus.
16658,L92822,u556,m35,EVE,"Here, pick these up!"
16659,L92821,u547,m35,ADAM,I just had a mental picture of...
16660,L92820,u556,m35,EVE,What's wrong with you?
16661,L92819,u556,m35,EVE,A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
16662,L92818,u547,m35,ADAM,Dickhead?
16663,L92817,u556,m35,EVE,Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
16664,L92816,u547,m35,ADAM,"Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?"
16665,L92815,u556,m35,EVE,You're lost?
16666,L92814,u547,m35,ADAM,"No, I'm lost."
16667,L92813,u556,m35,EVE,"We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college."
16668,L92812,u547,m35,ADAM,Where are we going?
16669,L92805,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam."
16670,L92804,u556,m35,EVE,"Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner."
16671,L92797,u556,m35,EVE,"No, you get out of here."
16672,L92796,u547,m35,ADAM,Get out of here!
16673,L92795,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self."
16674,L92794,u547,m35,ADAM,No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
16675,L92793,u556,m35,EVE,Are you French?
16676,L92792,u547,m35,ADAM,"Bon soir, mademoiselle!"
16677,L92886,u547,m35,ADAM,Of course!
16678,L92885,u554,m35,CLERK,"Yes, sir."
16679,L92884,u547,m35,ADAM,A card?
16680,L92883,u554,m35,CLERK,Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
16681,L92882,u547,m35,ADAM,Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
16682,L92767,u547,m35,ADAM,Nothing.
16683,L92766,u554,m35,CLERK,What?
16684,L92765,u547,m35,ADAM,Is this because of the radiation?
16685,L92762,u547,m35,ADAM,Gee-ma-nee!
16686,L92761,u554,m35,CLERK,"Yes, it is."
16687,L92760,u547,m35,ADAM,Is that a birthday cake?!
16688,L93501,u564,m35,SODA JERK,Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
16689,L93500,u547,m35,ADAM,I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
16690,L92723,u547,m35,ADAM,I promise.
16691,L92722,u564,m35,SODA JERK,The front door is open.  Will you be back?
16692,L92721,u547,m35,ADAM,How do I leave here?
16693,L92720,u564,m35,SODA JERK,No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
16694,L92719,u547,m35,ADAM,That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
16695,L92718,u564,m35,SODA JERK,Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
16696,L92717,u547,m35,ADAM,"I've got to go, now."
16697,L92716,u564,m35,SODA JERK,Yes.
16698,L92715,u547,m35,ADAM,I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
16699,L92714,u564,m35,SODA JERK,Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
16700,L92713,u547,m35,ADAM,All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
16701,L92712,u564,m35,SODA JERK,"Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!"
16702,L92711,u547,m35,ADAM,Are you all right?
16703,L93625,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!"
16704,L93624,u547,m35,ADAM,"Uh, I think they have."
16705,L93623,u553,m35,CALVIN,"My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  ""No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!""  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!"
16706,L93622,u553,m35,CALVIN,Uh-huh.
16707,L93621,u547,m35,ADAM,Yes. That's kind of how it was.
16708,L93620,u553,m35,CALVIN,"What? Did the politburo just one day say - ""We give up?"""
16709,L93619,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, sir. It's true."
16710,L93618,u553,m35,CALVIN,That's what everybody believes?
16711,L93617,u547,m35,ADAM,Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
16712,L93616,u553,m35,CALVIN,You're sure?
16713,L93615,u547,m35,ADAM,"Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers."
16714,L93614,u553,m35,CALVIN,Uh-huh.
16715,L93613,u547,m35,ADAM,It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
16716,L93612,u553,m35,CALVIN,"This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?"
16717,L93568,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Well, in that case...of course, son."
16718,L93567,u547,m35,ADAM,"And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why."
16719,L93566,u553,m35,CALVIN,"But, I don't understand."
16720,L92710,u547,m35,ADAM,I'll try.
16721,L92709,u553,m35,CALVIN,"One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you."
16722,L92708,u547,m35,ADAM,I promise. Is that all?
16723,L92707,u553,m35,CALVIN,Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
16724,L92706,u547,m35,ADAM,Adult Bookstore.  Why?
16725,L92705,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Also...stay out of the ""Adult Bookstore."""
16726,L92704,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, sir.  Is that all?"
16727,L92703,u553,m35,CALVIN,...the pipe tobacco.
16728,L92702,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, father?! Yes?"
16729,L92701,u553,m35,CALVIN,Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
16730,L92631,u547,m35,ADAM,Merci!
16731,L92630,u553,m35,CALVIN,"C'est bon, Monsieur."
16732,L92625,u547,m35,ADAM,Shit is a French word?
16733,L92624,u553,m35,CALVIN,Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
16734,L92622,u553,m35,CALVIN,"No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious."
16735,L92621,u547,m35,ADAM,"Well, do we just go on up?!"
16736,L92591,u547,m35,ADAM,These are really swell! I mean swell!
16737,L92590,u553,m35,CALVIN,Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
16738,L92589,u547,m35,ADAM,Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
16739,L92586,u547,m35,ADAM,No kidding!
16740,L92585,u553,m35,CALVIN,Your mom made that all by herself.
16741,L92584,u547,m35,ADAM,"Oh, boy! A jacket!"
16742,L92582,u553,m35,CALVIN,Blow out the candles!
16743,L92581,u547,m35,ADAM,"Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!"
16744,L92576,u553,m35,CALVIN,Because he must!
16745,L92575,u547,m35,ADAM,Then why go there?
16746,L92574,u553,m35,CALVIN,Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
16747,L92573,u547,m35,ADAM,Why?
16748,L92572,u553,m35,CALVIN,"No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!"
16749,L92565,u553,m35,CALVIN,No. Sit down.
16750,L92564,u547,m35,ADAM,The nocturnal flying mammal?
16751,L92563,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat."
16752,L92562,u547,m35,ADAM,Like one of Mom's?
16753,L92561,u553,m35,CALVIN,"No, son. A pitcher."
16754,L92560,u547,m35,ADAM,Like a painting?
16755,L92559,u553,m35,CALVIN,"It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher."
16756,L92558,u547,m35,ADAM,What's baseball?
16757,L92557,u553,m35,CALVIN,It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
16758,L92556,u547,m35,ADAM,These are wonderful.
16759,L92553,u553,m35,CALVIN,"You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me."
16760,L92552,u547,m35,ADAM,Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
16761,L92551,u553,m35,CALVIN,Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!

16764,L92548,u547,m35,ADAM,Tempus fugit!
16765,L92547,u553,m35,CALVIN,"You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!"
16766,L92546,u547,m35,ADAM,"Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday."
16767,L92545,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam."
16768,L92544,u547,m35,ADAM,They're pretty.  Can I have them?
16769,L92543,u553,m35,CALVIN,"This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an ""investment.""  These are stock ""certificates"" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable."
16770,L93488,u567,m35,TROY,What?
16771,L93487,u547,m35,ADAM,And thanks for always being happy!
16772,L93486,u567,m35,TROY,"Bye, Adam!"
16773,L93485,u547,m35,ADAM,"Bye, Troy!"
16774,L93465,u547,m35,ADAM,Goodbye.
16775,L93464,u567,m35,TROY,"Good-bye, Adam."
16776,L93443,u567,m35,TROY,Yeah...Seems to.
16777,L93442,u547,m35,ADAM,Does that work?
16778,L93441,u567,m35,TROY,I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
16779,L93440,u547,m35,ADAM,"No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on."
16780,L93439,u567,m35,TROY,A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
16781,L93438,u547,m35,ADAM,What?
16782,L93437,u567,m35,TROY,"So, did you buy a movie?"
16783,L93436,u547,m35,ADAM,You bet!
16784,L93435,u567,m35,TROY,How 'bout we check with Eve first?
16785,L93434,u547,m35,ADAM,"Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!"
16786,L93431,u547,m35,ADAM,No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
16787,L93430,u567,m35,TROY,"I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry."
16788,L93265,u547,m35,ADAM,"Okay. Thank you, my friends."
16789,L93264,u567,m35,TROY,Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
16790,L93203,u547,m35,ADAM,"Ladies first, Troy! That was close."
16791,L93202,u567,m35,TROY,What?!
16792,L93201,u547,m35,ADAM,Oh. I see.
16793,L93200,u567,m35,TROY,Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
16794,L93199,u547,m35,ADAM,Why did you park way back there?
16795,L93183,u547,m35,ADAM,I LOVE THIS!!
16796,L93182,u567,m35,TROY,That's why little things mean so much to him.
16797,L93171,u547,m35,ADAM,Amazing. I'm very impressed.
16798,L93170,u567,m35,TROY,"The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months."
16799,L93169,u547,m35,ADAM,The recovery is very impressive.
16800,L93168,u567,m35,TROY,Almost all of them.
16801,L93167,u547,m35,ADAM,I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
16802,L93164,u547,m35,ADAM,No.
16803,L93163,u567,m35,TROY,Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
16804,L93156,u567,m35,TROY,Okay.
16805,L93155,u547,m35,ADAM,I just don't want to.
16806,L93154,u567,m35,TROY,Why not? He has great pants.
16807,L93153,u547,m35,ADAM,I'm not wearing his pants.
16808,L93152,u567,m35,TROY,Not on him.
16809,L93129,u567,m35,TROY,True.
16810,L93128,u547,m35,ADAM,...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
16811,L93127,u567,m35,TROY,"Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?"
16812,L93126,u547,m35,ADAM,Yes. He likes windows.
16813,L93125,u567,m35,TROY,"He's a Windows guy then, huh?"
16814,L93124,u547,m35,ADAM,"Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him."
16815,L93123,u567,m35,TROY,Yeah?
16816,L93122,u547,m35,ADAM,That would knock my father out.
16817,L93121,u567,m35,TROY,"Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!"
16818,L93120,u547,m35,ADAM,Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
16819,L93119,u567,m35,TROY,"How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?"
16820,L93118,u547,m35,ADAM,No.
16821,L93117,u567,m35,TROY,You don't have a computer in your cabin?
16822,L93116,u547,m35,ADAM,I don't think so.
16823,L93115,u567,m35,TROY,What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
16824,L93114,u547,m35,ADAM,It's so small.
16825,L93113,u567,m35,TROY,Yeah.
16826,L93112,u547,m35,ADAM,This must be very new.
16827,L93103,u547,m35,ADAM,"Sorry, that's the largest city."
16828,L93102,u567,m35,TROY,Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
16829,L93101,u547,m35,ADAM,Juneau.
16830,L93100,u567,m35,TROY,What's the capitol?
16831,L93099,u547,m35,ADAM,"1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course."
16832,L93098,u567,m35,TROY,When did we get it from them?
16833,L93097,u547,m35,ADAM,Russia.
16834,L93096,u567,m35,TROY,Who use to own it?
16835,L93095,u547,m35,ADAM,1959.
16836,L93094,u567,m35,TROY,"Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?"
16837,L93091,u567,m35,TROY,Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
16838,L93090,u547,m35,ADAM,I've got goose-bumps all over me.
16839,L93088,u567,m35,TROY,She's right?!
16840,L93087,u547,m35,ADAM,I've never met anyone like you in my life.
16841,L93086,u567,m35,TROY,That's right?
16842,L93077,u567,m35,TROY,"Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town."
16843,L93076,u547,m35,ADAM,Right on the button.
16844,L93072,u567,m35,TROY,Really?  Since when?
16845,L93071,u547,m35,ADAM,Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
16846,L93070,u567,m35,TROY,And it's called...?
16847,L93069,u547,m35,ADAM,It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
16848,L93061,u567,m35,TROY,You nut!
16849,L93060,u547,m35,ADAM,I love Lucy!
16850,L93059,u567,m35,TROY,"Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or ""nori"" if you prefer. I love sushi."
16851,L93058,u547,m35,ADAM,Not particularly.
16852,L93057,u567,m35,TROY,"I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?"
16853,L93056,u547,m35,ADAM,You have very nice ceilings.
16854,L92904,u550,m35,BELLBOY,Goodnight.
16855,L92903,u547,m35,ADAM,Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
16856,L92902,u550,m35,BELLBOY,Up here on the fifteenth floor?
16857,L92901,u547,m35,ADAM,I guess living up here makes people look older.
16858,L92900,u550,m35,BELLBOY,Twenty-five? Around there.
16859,L92899,u547,m35,ADAM,How old do I look?
16860,L92898,u550,m35,BELLBOY,You don't look thirty-five.
16861,L92897,u547,m35,ADAM,Thirty-five.
16862,L92896,u550,m35,BELLBOY,How old are you?
16863,L92895,u547,m35,ADAM,Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
16864,L92894,u550,m35,BELLBOY,No kiddin'. Well...good night.
16865,L92893,u547,m35,ADAM,My father is a genius.
16866,L92892,u550,m35,BELLBOY,Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
16867,L92891,u547,m35,ADAM,"I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice."
16868,L92890,u550,m35,BELLBOY,The hotel.
16869,L92889,u547,m35,ADAM,Of what?
16870,L92888,u550,m35,BELLBOY,You dial nine to get out.
16871,L92729,u547,m35,ADAM,Just look!!
16872,L92728,u552,m35,BYSTANDER #1,I don't see anything!
16873,L92727,u547,m35,ADAM,Up there!!
16874,L92726,u552,m35,BYSTANDER #1,The sky?  Where?
16875,L92725,u547,m35,ADAM,The sky!!!
16876,L92724,u552,m35,BYSTANDER #1,What?  What is it?!
16877,L92777,u551,m35,BUTCHER,Gladly.
16878,L92776,u547,m35,ADAM,"Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?"
16879,L92775,u551,m35,BUTCHER,Sure.
16880,L92774,u551,m35,BUTCHER,You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
16881,L92773,u547,m35,ADAM,"Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!"
16882,L92772,u551,m35,BUTCHER,"Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box."
16883,L92771,u547,m35,ADAM,Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
16884,L92769,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties."
16885,L92768,u551,m35,BUTCHER,Help you?
16886,L92742,u547,m35,ADAM,Good!
16887,L92741,u563,m35,POSTAL WORKER,I do alright.
16888,L92740,u547,m35,ADAM,"How do you do, ma'am."
16889,L92739,u563,m35,POSTAL WORKER,Say what?!
16890,L92738,u547,m35,ADAM,"Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!"
16891,L92737,u563,m35,POSTAL WORKER,Whatcha looking at?
16892,L92809,u558,m35,JERRY,"Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?"
16893,L92808,u547,m35,ADAM,I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
16894,L92802,u558,m35,JERRY,"Oh, you got a problem with that?"
16895,L92801,u547,m35,ADAM,Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
16896,L92789,u558,m35,JERRY,"Well, we're here to help!"
16897,L92788,u547,m35,ADAM,"Oh, that would be wonderful!"
16898,L92787,u558,m35,JERRY,I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
16899,L92786,u547,m35,ADAM,"See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that."
16900,L92785,u558,m35,JERRY,Really? No kidding?
16901,L92784,u547,m35,ADAM,I was thinking of selling all the cards.
16902,L92783,u558,m35,JERRY,"How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?"
16903,L92781,u558,m35,JERRY,Hi.
16904,L92780,u547,m35,ADAM,Hello.
16905,L93607,u547,m35,ADAM,Yes.
16906,L93606,u557,m35,HELEN,No.
16907,L93605,u547,m35,ADAM,Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
16908,L93604,u557,m35,HELEN,"Well, where are you --"
16909,L93603,u547,m35,ADAM,"No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office."
16910,L93602,u557,m35,HELEN,This is your bedroom?
16911,L93572,u557,m35,HELEN,"No, wait! At least stay for dinner!"
16912,L93571,u547,m35,ADAM,We have to go.
16913,L93565,u547,m35,ADAM,I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
16914,L93564,u557,m35,HELEN,What?
16915,L93563,u547,m35,ADAM,Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
16916,L93505,u557,m35,HELEN,A psychiatrist?!
16917,L93504,u547,m35,ADAM,I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
16918,L93503,u557,m35,HELEN,"Are you in trouble, son?!"
16919,L93502,u547,m35,ADAM,...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
16920,L92700,u547,m35,ADAM,"Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents."
16921,L92699,u557,m35,HELEN,"Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do."
16922,L92698,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, ma'am."
16923,L92697,u557,m35,HELEN,"Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything."
16924,L92695,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, ma'am."
16925,L92694,u557,m35,HELEN,"Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer."
16926,L92693,u547,m35,ADAM,"I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so."
16927,L92692,u557,m35,HELEN,Yes?
16928,L92691,u547,m35,ADAM,Mom?
16929,L92690,u557,m35,HELEN,I just hope this is still good up there.
16930,L92689,u547,m35,ADAM,Right.
16931,L92687,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, ma'am."
16932,L92686,u557,m35,HELEN,"I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing."
16933,L92683,u557,m35,HELEN,You're my brave boy.
16934,L92682,u547,m35,ADAM,I'll be all right.
16935,L92681,u557,m35,HELEN,I'm afraid you've got to.
16936,L92680,u547,m35,ADAM,I'll go up.
16937,L92679,u557,m35,HELEN,He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
16938,L92678,u557,m35,HELEN,"Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom."
16939,L92677,u547,m35,ADAM,Dad!
16940,L92607,u557,m35,HELEN,You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
16941,L92606,u547,m35,ADAM,"Sorry, Mom!"
16942,L92605,u557,m35,HELEN,"Elbows, Son."
16943,L92598,u547,m35,ADAM,"Yes, ma'am."
16944,L92597,u557,m35,HELEN,"Oh. A nice one, I hope."
16945,L93480,u548,m35,ARON,Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
16946,L93479,u556,m35,EVE,I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
16947,L93478,u548,m35,ARON,And now you must let me be the judge of that!
16948,L93477,u556,m35,EVE,"You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone."
16949,L93476,u548,m35,ARON,"Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious."
16950,L93475,u556,m35,EVE,"No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--"
16951,L93474,u548,m35,ARON,I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
16952,L93473,u556,m35,EVE,No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
16953,L93472,u548,m35,ARON,He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
16954,L93471,u556,m35,EVE,"Oh, my God!"
16955,L92459,u549,m35,ATKINSON,Yeah.
16956,L92458,u559,m35,LEVY,Good god.
16957,L92457,u549,m35,ATKINSON,Yeah.
16958,L92456,u559,m35,LEVY,He drank it hot?
16959,L92455,u549,m35,ATKINSON,The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
16960,L92454,u559,m35,LEVY,All back East.
16961,L92453,u549,m35,ATKINSON,What about relatives?
16962,L92452,u559,m35,LEVY,"Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess."
16963,L92451,u549,m35,ATKINSON,"Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit."
16964,L92450,u559,m35,LEVY,"According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase."
16965,L92652,u553,m35,CALVIN,"No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to..."
16966,L92651,u565,m35,STREET WALKER,"Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture."
16967,L92650,u553,m35,CALVIN,Really?
16968,L92649,u565,m35,STREET WALKER,"Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!"
16969,L92648,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  ""Boy?""  Did you say you were a ""country boy?"""
16970,L92647,u565,m35,STREET WALKER,"""Hell up here?""  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere."
16971,L92646,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?"
16972,L92645,u565,m35,STREET WALKER,"The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: ""A country boy can survive!"""
16973,L92644,u553,m35,CALVIN,"So...you...survived the blast, did you?"
16974,L92643,u565,m35,STREET WALKER,Good.
16975,L92642,u553,m35,CALVIN,"What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!"
16976,L92641,u565,m35,STREET WALKER,"You got a light, honey?"
16977,L93562,u557,m35,HELEN,"What can I offer you, Eve?"
16978,L93561,u553,m35,CALVIN,Some time.
16979,L93560,u557,m35,HELEN,"Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um..."
16980,L93554,u553,m35,CALVIN,To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
16981,L93553,u557,m35,HELEN,"Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and..."
16982,L93552,u553,m35,CALVIN,I thought ten years.
16983,L93551,u557,m35,HELEN,How long will you set it for this time?
16984,L92906,u557,m35,HELEN,Amen.
16985,L92905,u553,m35,CALVIN,"And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen."
16986,L92750,u557,m35,HELEN,"Yes, dear, I know."
16987,L92749,u553,m35,CALVIN,He's smart.
16988,L92676,u553,m35,CALVIN,--do as I say!
16989,L92675,u557,m35,HELEN,And the ocean!  A mountain range!
16990,L92674,u553,m35,CALVIN,--and we will--
16991,L92673,u557,m35,HELEN,I want him to at least see the sky!
16992,L92672,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Well, I am the head of this household--"
16993,L92671,u557,m35,HELEN,"No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!"
16994,L92670,u553,m35,CALVIN,We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
16995,L92669,u557,m35,HELEN,For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
16996,L92668,u557,m35,HELEN,Excuse me.
16997,L92667,u553,m35,CALVIN,Yes.
16998,L92666,u557,m35,HELEN,We do?
16999,L92665,u553,m35,CALVIN,We stay down here.
17000,L92664,u557,m35,HELEN,"Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?"
17001,L92663,u553,m35,CALVIN,"They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't."
17002,L92661,u557,m35,HELEN,I don't believe it!
17003,L92660,u553,m35,CALVIN,Yes.
17004,L92659,u557,m35,HELEN,No.
17005,L92658,u553,m35,CALVIN,Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
17006,L92657,u553,m35,CALVIN,"It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!"
17007,L92656,u557,m35,HELEN,Mutants?!
17008,L92655,u553,m35,CALVIN,"I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants."
17009,L92628,u557,m35,HELEN,Yes! That's right!
17010,L92627,u553,m35,CALVIN,"It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...""good""."
17011,L92626,u557,m35,HELEN,"Yes, yes it is!"
17012,L92620,u557,m35,HELEN,Just open the door.
17013,L92619,u553,m35,CALVIN,Should we say a little prayer first?
17014,L92615,u553,m35,CALVIN,"I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?"
17015,L92614,u557,m35,HELEN,"Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work."
17016,L92613,u553,m35,CALVIN,In the generator room again?
17017,L92612,u553,m35,CALVIN,Sure.
17018,L92611,u557,m35,HELEN,Would you excuse me?
17019,L92610,u553,m35,CALVIN,"You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?"
17020,L92609,u557,m35,HELEN,Yes...
17021,L92608,u553,m35,CALVIN,If we still have one.
17022,L92604,u553,m35,CALVIN,Yeah. Let's dig in!
17023,L92603,u557,m35,HELEN,Let's eat our cake.
17024,L92601,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful."
17025,L92600,u557,m35,HELEN,Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
17026,L92599,u553,m35,CALVIN,One who doesn't glow in the dark.
17027,L92595,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Well, we did in my family!"
17028,L92594,u557,m35,HELEN,"Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!"
17029,L92593,u553,m35,CALVIN,"If he tells, it won't come true!"
17030,L92592,u557,m35,HELEN,"What did you wish for, Adam?"
17031,L92588,u553,m35,CALVIN,And I made these!
17032,L92587,u557,m35,HELEN,No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
17033,L92580,u553,m35,CALVIN,You bet.
17034,L92579,u557,m35,HELEN,Get the presents and do the lights.
17035,L92578,u553,m35,CALVIN,Coming!
17036,L92577,u557,m35,HELEN,Calvin!
17037,L92555,u557,m35,HELEN,Hi.
17038,L92554,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Hi, honey!"
17039,L92532,u553,m35,CALVIN,"I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches."
17040,L92531,u557,m35,HELEN,"Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept."
17041,L92530,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be."
17042,L92528,u553,m35,CALVIN,Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
17043,L92527,u557,m35,HELEN,"Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school."
17044,L92526,u553,m35,CALVIN,Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
17045,L92509,u553,m35,CALVIN,What?
17046,L92508,u557,m35,HELEN,Watch this!
17047,L92507,u553,m35,CALVIN,Yes.  Well... yes.
17048,L92506,u557,m35,HELEN,"Very nice. Unless it caved in, too."
17049,L92505,u553,m35,CALVIN,"No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!"
17050,L92504,u557,m35,HELEN,Why?
17051,L92503,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway."
17052,L92502,u557,m35,HELEN,We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
17053,L92501,u553,m35,CALVIN,Right here!
17054,L92500,u557,m35,HELEN,Calvin?!
17055,L92489,u553,m35,CALVIN,"What? Whatever you want, Helen!"
17056,L92488,u557,m35,HELEN,If I...you know...
17057,L92487,u553,m35,CALVIN,Yes!
17058,L92486,u557,m35,HELEN,And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
17059,L92485,u553,m35,CALVIN,No.  I think it's just right.
17060,L92484,u557,m35,HELEN,What shall we call him?
17061,L92483,u553,m35,CALVIN,I've noticed.
17062,L92482,u557,m35,HELEN,"No, Calvin.  Babies cry."
17063,L92481,u553,m35,CALVIN,Is there a problem?
17064,L92479,u553,m35,CALVIN,Honey?
17065,L92478,u557,m35,HELEN,"Uh, oh. Now it's time."
17066,L92477,u553,m35,CALVIN,What?
17067,L92476,u557,m35,HELEN,"Oh, no."
17068,L92475,u553,m35,CALVIN,I told you! I've got everything!
17069,L92474,u557,m35,HELEN,You have tranquilizers?
17070,L92473,u553,m35,CALVIN,Would you like a tranquilizer?
17071,L92472,u557,m35,HELEN,"No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!"
17072,L92471,u553,m35,CALVIN,How could you?! This is just like home!
17073,L92470,u557,m35,HELEN,Maybe I've just got the creeps.
17074,L92468,u553,m35,CALVIN,Really?
17075,L92467,u557,m35,HELEN,"No, Calvin, you're favorite."
17076,L92466,u553,m35,CALVIN,Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
17077,L92465,u557,m35,HELEN,I'm not hungry.
17078,L92464,u553,m35,CALVIN,Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
17079,L92463,u557,m35,HELEN,All our friends...
17080,L92462,u553,m35,CALVIN,"We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child."
17081,L92461,u557,m35,HELEN,No.
17082,L92460,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Hi, honey! Feeling better?"
17083,L92448,u557,m35,HELEN,To go up.
17084,L92447,u553,m35,CALVIN,To go up.
17085,L92446,u557,m35,HELEN,It's safe.
17086,L92445,u553,m35,CALVIN,Then after that it's safe.
17087,L92444,u557,m35,HELEN,Thirty -five years!
17088,L92443,u553,m35,CALVIN,To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
17089,L92442,u557,m35,HELEN,The locks?
17090,L92441,u553,m35,CALVIN,The locks.
17091,L92440,u557,m35,HELEN,What's that noise?
17092,L92434,u557,m35,HELEN,To you maybe.
17093,L92433,u553,m35,CALVIN,Home sweet home!
17094,L92432,u557,m35,HELEN,As long as we've got that straight.
17095,L92431,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Yes, dear!"
17096,L92430,u557,m35,HELEN,"Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers."
17097,L92429,u553,m35,CALVIN,I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
17098,L92428,u557,m35,HELEN,"But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time."
17099,L92427,u553,m35,CALVIN,Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
17100,L92426,u557,m35,HELEN,Days??
17101,L92425,u553,m35,CALVIN,"I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days."
17102,L92424,u557,m35,HELEN,How long will we have to stay down here?
17103,L92419,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio."
17104,L92418,u557,m35,HELEN,"Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?"
17105,L92417,u553,m35,CALVIN,Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
17106,L92416,u557,m35,HELEN,Cheese is particularly troublesome.
17107,L92415,u553,m35,CALVIN,I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
17108,L92414,u557,m35,HELEN,"Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates."
17109,L92412,u557,m35,HELEN,Yes.
17110,L92411,u553,m35,CALVIN,You hear that?!
17111,L92408,u557,m35,HELEN,I never know anymore.
17112,L92407,u553,m35,CALVIN,No.  They all do.
17113,L92406,u557,m35,HELEN,Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
17114,L92405,u553,m35,CALVIN,It shuts off automatically.
17115,L92401,u557,m35,HELEN,"Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--"
17116,L92400,u553,m35,CALVIN,It's time.
17117,L92398,u557,m35,HELEN,We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
17118,L92397,u553,m35,CALVIN,"I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!"
17119,L92357,u553,m35,CALVIN,"You bet, hon!"
17120,L92356,u557,m35,HELEN,"Well, put it down and come in!"
17121,L92355,u553,m35,CALVIN,"Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat."
17122,L92354,u557,m35,HELEN,"For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!"
17123,L93336,u555,m35,CLIFF,I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
17124,L93335,u556,m35,EVE,"Stop it, you two!"
17125,L93332,u555,m35,CLIFF,Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
17126,L93331,u556,m35,EVE,"Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel."
17127,L93324,u555,m35,CLIFF,"You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve."
17128,L93323,u556,m35,EVE,"So where is your roommate, the model?"
17129,L93048,u555,m35,CLIFF,"Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!"
17130,L93047,u556,m35,EVE,"Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be."
17131,L93044,u556,m35,EVE,"This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff."
17132,L93043,u555,m35,CLIFF,"Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?"
17133,L93042,u556,m35,EVE,You came back for these?
17134,L93041,u556,m35,EVE,Your stuff?  Let me see that.
17135,L93040,u555,m35,CLIFF,I forgot some of my stuff.
17136,L93039,u556,m35,EVE,What are you doing here?
17137,L93038,u555,m35,CLIFF,What are you bitching about now?
17138,L93549,u556,m35,EVE,Stop!
17139,L93548,u567,m35,TROY,Where?!
17140,L93547,u556,m35,EVE,Adam!!
17141,L93544,u567,m35,TROY,Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
17142,L93543,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home."
17143,L93542,u567,m35,TROY,None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
17144,L93541,u556,m35,EVE,Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
17145,L93535,u556,m35,EVE,Come on.
17146,L93534,u567,m35,TROY,An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
17147,L93533,u556,m35,EVE,What?!
17148,L93532,u567,m35,TROY,"No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store."
17149,L93531,u556,m35,EVE,You didn't stop anywhere else?!
17150,L93530,u567,m35,TROY,We came back to the house!
17151,L93529,u556,m35,EVE,Then what?
17152,L93528,u567,m35,TROY,To get some frozen poultry.
17153,L93527,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!"
17154,L93526,u567,m35,TROY,I don't know. I like to think so.
17155,L93525,u556,m35,EVE,"He was always so ""nice""! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! ""Nice"" is weird! Nice is...what is ""nice""? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?"
17156,L93524,u567,m35,TROY,Yeah! That's thinking.
17157,L93523,u556,m35,EVE,Have him committed.
17158,L93522,u567,m35,TROY,"Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!"
17159,L93519,u567,m35,TROY,See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
17160,L93518,u556,m35,EVE,I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
17161,L93517,u567,m35,TROY,What's wrong?
17162,L93515,u556,m35,EVE,We'll find him.
17163,L93514,u567,m35,TROY,And if we can't find him?
17164,L93513,u556,m35,EVE,Give it back to him.
17165,L93512,u567,m35,TROY,What do you want to do with it?
17166,L93498,u567,m35,TROY,Fallout shelter.
17167,L93497,u556,m35,EVE,"Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?"
17168,L93490,u567,m35,TROY,"Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!"
17169,L93489,u556,m35,EVE,Gay.
17170,L93470,u567,m35,TROY,What?!
17171,L93469,u556,m35,EVE,"Oh, no!"
17172,L93468,u567,m35,TROY,I know...I know. You did the right thing.
17173,L93467,u556,m35,EVE,"Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!"
17174,L93388,u556,m35,EVE,Coward!
17175,L93387,u567,m35,TROY,I don't think so.
17176,L93386,u556,m35,EVE,You're goddamn right I am!
17177,L93385,u567,m35,TROY,What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
17178,L93384,u556,m35,EVE,"Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!"
17179,L93383,u567,m35,TROY,It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
17180,L93382,u556,m35,EVE,What?!!
17181,L93381,u567,m35,TROY,He left with Sophie.
17182,L93380,u556,m35,EVE,Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
17183,L93379,u567,m35,TROY,He didn't leave with them.
17184,L93378,u556,m35,EVE,So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
17185,L93377,u567,m35,TROY,From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
17186,L93376,u556,m35,EVE,Where did he get all that information?
17187,L93375,u567,m35,TROY,"Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses..."
17188,L93374,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is."
17189,L93373,u567,m35,TROY,He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
17190,L93372,u556,m35,EVE,What?
17191,L93371,u567,m35,TROY,"You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?"
17192,L93370,u556,m35,EVE,Or have perfect table manners.
17193,L93369,u567,m35,TROY,"Yes, you do!"
17194,L93368,u556,m35,EVE,Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
17195,L93367,u567,m35,TROY,"Uh, yes, you do."
17196,L93366,u556,m35,EVE,And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
17197,L93365,u567,m35,TROY,"Yes, you do."
17198,L93364,u556,m35,EVE,"In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days."
17199,L93363,u556,m35,EVE,What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
17200,L93362,u567,m35,TROY,Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
17201,L93361,u556,m35,EVE,To bed?
17202,L93360,u567,m35,TROY,To bed.
17203,L93359,u556,m35,EVE,Where are you going?
17204,L93358,u567,m35,TROY,Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
17205,L93357,u556,m35,EVE,Those sluts!
17206,L93356,u567,m35,TROY,"Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me."
17207,L93355,u556,m35,EVE,"I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?"
17208,L93354,u567,m35,TROY,What's it to you?!
17209,L93353,u556,m35,EVE,Who did he leave with?
17210,L93352,u567,m35,TROY,We did not leave together.
17211,L93351,u556,m35,EVE,What's that mean?
17212,L93350,u567,m35,TROY,Uh..he might of.
17213,L93349,u556,m35,EVE,He go back to the hotel?
17214,L93305,u567,m35,TROY,"Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!"
17215,L93304,u556,m35,EVE,Go to the bathroom.
17216,L93255,u556,m35,EVE,It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
17217,L93254,u567,m35,TROY,Um... Eve?
17218,L93250,u567,m35,TROY,"Adam,  I think for you, we should go for ""sweet."""
17219,L93249,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal."
17220,L93248,u567,m35,TROY,Eve?!
17221,L93247,u556,m35,EVE,Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
17222,L93215,u556,m35,EVE,For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
17223,L93214,u567,m35,TROY,Always good advice.
17224,L93213,u556,m35,EVE,Just be yourself.
17225,L93181,u567,m35,TROY,He's from Alaska.
17226,L93180,u556,m35,EVE,That water's freezing!
17227,L93177,u556,m35,EVE,No.
17228,L93176,u567,m35,TROY,"How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?"
17229,L93174,u567,m35,TROY,Let me show you the entire trousseau!
17230,L93173,u556,m35,EVE,I think...it...works.
17231,L93172,u567,m35,TROY,"Well, what do you think?"
17232,L93159,u567,m35,TROY,"What do you think, Adam?"
17233,L93158,u556,m35,EVE,I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
17234,L93157,u567,m35,TROY,"Alright, I will."
17235,L93149,u567,m35,TROY,That's what I'm sensing.
17236,L93148,u556,m35,EVE,Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
17237,L93147,u567,m35,TROY,"I see ""elegant."""
17238,L93146,u556,m35,EVE,"And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?"
17239,L93145,u567,m35,TROY,I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
17240,L93144,u556,m35,EVE,"Well, that's blunt!"
17241,L93143,u567,m35,TROY,It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
17242,L93142,u556,m35,EVE,What's that supposed to mean?
17243,L93141,u567,m35,TROY,"You're serious, aren't you?"
17244,L93138,u556,m35,EVE,Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
17245,L93137,u567,m35,TROY,I don't know.
17246,L93134,u556,m35,EVE,"Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that."
17247,L93133,u567,m35,TROY,"But first, you have to start with the clothes!"
17248,L93079,u567,m35,TROY,"Oh, my God..."
17249,L93078,u556,m35,EVE,Give me your hand.
17250,L93075,u556,m35,EVE,"I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?"
17251,L93074,u567,m35,TROY,"Oh, yes."
17252,L93073,u556,m35,EVE,Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
17253,L93068,u556,m35,EVE,Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
17254,L93067,u567,m35,TROY,"So, Adam...where on earth are you from?"
17255,L93055,u567,m35,TROY,"Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse."
17256,L93054,u556,m35,EVE,I knew you'd like him.
17257,L93053,u567,m35,TROY,Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
17258,L92570,u561,m35,MOM,"I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway."
17259,L92569,u564,m35,SODA JERK,"Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!"
17260,L92568,u561,m35,MOM,Buy it from me?
17261,L92567,u564,m35,SODA JERK,"Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh..."
17262,L92566,u561,m35,MOM,I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
17263,L92540,u564,m35,SODA JERK,Um...uh...
17264,L92539,u561,m35,MOM,I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
17265,L92537,u564,m35,SODA JERK,Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
17266,L92536,u561,m35,MOM,I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
17267,L92534,u564,m35,SODA JERK,"You bet, Mom! Coming up!"
17268,L92533,u561,m35,MOM,I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
17269,L92423,u566,m35,TOWER,"Roger, Wolf One."
17270,L92422,u562,m35,PILOT,I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
17271,L92421,u566,m35,TOWER,The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
17272,L92420,u562,m35,PILOT,"Tower, say again!!"
17273,L92395,u566,m35,TOWER,"Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?"
17274,L92394,u562,m35,PILOT,I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
17275,L92393,u566,m35,TOWER,Wolf One -- say intentions.
17276,L92363,u562,m35,PILOT,Stand by. One.
17277,L92362,u566,m35,TOWER,"Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?"
17278,L92361,u562,m35,PILOT,Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
17279,L97520,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it."
17280,L97519,u568,m36,AUNT BARBARA,"Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by."
17281,L97518,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
17282,L97208,u568,m36,AUNT BARBARA,Okay honey.
17283,L97207,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go."
17284,L97206,u568,m36,AUNT BARBARA,I've seen a few.
17285,L97205,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
17286,L97204,u568,m36,AUNT BARBARA,Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
17287,L97203,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
17288,L96982,u568,m36,AUNT BARBARA,I'm not sick.
17289,L96981,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?"
17290,L96827,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry."
17291,L96826,u568,m36,AUNT BARBARA,"Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?"
17292,L96788,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
17293,L96787,u568,m36,AUNT BARBARA,I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
17294,L96767,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah. How's Dad?
17295,L96766,u568,m36,AUNT BARBARA,"You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?"
17296,L96765,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
17297,L97482,u573,m36,FRANK,Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.

17313,L97681,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Oh my God. Is her son OK?
17314,L97680,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Not yet.
17315,L97679,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
17316,L97678,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
17317,L97672,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
17318,L97671,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
17319,L97670,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,"Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?"
17320,L97669,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
17321,L97548,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes sir.
17322,L97547,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,"For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later."
17323,L97546,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes sir. I sure am.
17324,L97545,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,You're all through with this now?
17325,L97544,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Only you and the photo lab.
17326,L97543,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Who knows you have these?
17327,L97542,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"No, not at all."
17328,L97541,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Is Sandy part of this?
17329,L97540,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
17330,L97539,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,"Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?"
17331,L97538,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help."
17332,L97537,u574,m36,JEFFREY,And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
17333,L97535,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this."
17334,L97534,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Okay?
17335,L97533,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah.
17336,L97532,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,"Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift."
17337,L97531,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you."
17338,L97530,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Jeffrey! Come on in.
17339,L97444,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,It's blue. Blue velvet.
17340,L97443,u574,m36,JEFFREY,What color is it?
17341,L97268,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
17342,L97267,u574,m36,JEFFREY,What is this? What color is it?
17343,L97266,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah. I get it.
17344,L97265,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
17345,L97264,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Why do you do it?
17346,L97263,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
17347,L97262,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I guess you've seen some bad things.
17348,L97261,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Yes.
17349,L97260,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Is that why you say it's horrible?
17350,L97259,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,The criminals are winning.
17351,L97258,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Anything you can tell me?
17352,L97257,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Okay.
17353,L97256,u574,m36,JEFFREY,These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
17354,L97254,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,"If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures."
17355,L97253,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes?
17356,L97252,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Jeffrey?
17357,L96857,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
17358,L96856,u574,m36,JEFFREY,It must be great.
17359,L96855,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
17360,L96854,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
17361,L96853,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,"Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't."
17362,L96850,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Excuse me, Mrs. Williams."
17363,L96849,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Come into the study a minute.
17364,L96820,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
17365,L96819,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
17366,L96818,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,"By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?"
17367,L96812,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,"Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it."
17368,L96811,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
17369,L96810,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,You did? A human ear?
17370,L96809,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear."
17371,L96808,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
17372,L96807,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?"
17373,L96806,u570,m36,DETECTIVE WILLIAMS,Yes.
17374,L96805,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Are you Detective Williams?
17375,L97645,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Hold me. I'M FALLING!
17376,L97644,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I promise, Dorothy. I promise."
17377,L97643,u571,m36,DOROTHY,HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
17378,L97642,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Don? Where is he?
17379,L97641,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Hold me, Don."
17380,L97635,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
17381,L97634,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Who, Dorothy?"
17382,L97633,u571,m36,DOROTHY,They hurt his head.
17383,L97624,u571,m36,DOROTHY,My secret lover.
17384,L97623,u574,m36,JEFFREY,It's okay. It's okay.
17385,L97622,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God."
17386,L97618,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God."
17387,L97617,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Yeah, it's me."
17388,L97424,u571,m36,DOROTHY,No.  Hi baby.
17389,L97423,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Oh no.
17390,L97421,u574,m36,JEFFREY,You look beautiful to me.
17391,L97420,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
17392,L97419,u574,m36,JEFFREY,What?
17393,L97418,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
17394,L97417,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I'll call you.
17395,L97415,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I think I better go.
17396,L97414,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I want you to stay with me.
17397,L97413,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I guess I should go.
17398,L97410,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
17399,L97409,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
17400,L97408,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes.
17401,L97407,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I did. Are you?
17402,L97406,u574,m36,JEFFREY,You called me Jeffrey.
17403,L97405,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold."
17404,L97404,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Dorothy. No!
17405,L97403,u571,m36,DOROTHY,There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
17406,L97402,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I'm glad you do.
17407,L97401,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?"
17408,L97400,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"There's no disease, I can tell you."
17409,L97399,u571,m36,DOROTHY,You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
17410,L97398,u574,m36,JEFFREY,You what?
17411,L97397,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
17412,L97396,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I didn't mean to hurt you.
17413,L97394,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"No, it's not Don."
17414,L97393,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I love you Don with all my heart.
17415,L97390,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Just get outta my bed.
17416,L97389,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
17417,L97388,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!"
17418,L97387,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Sometimes I think I do.
17419,L97386,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I asked first.
17420,L97385,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Do you love me?
17421,L97384,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Do you love me?
17422,L97383,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Kiss me.
17423,L97382,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Look, snap out of it, will ya?"
17424,L97381,u571,m36,DOROTHY,What if Frank came over here and found us?
17425,L97380,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Come on Dorothy.
17426,L97379,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Beeeee careful.
17427,L97378,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Shut up.
17428,L97377,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Does that scare you?
17429,L97376,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
17430,L97375,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Frank would open you.
17431,L97374,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"That wouldn't be too good, would it?"
17432,L97373,u571,m36,DOROTHY,What if I told Frank that you opened me?
17433,L97372,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes.
17434,L97371,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"You like to open me, don't you?"
17435,L97370,u571,m36,DOROTHY,No police!!!  No police!!
17436,L97369,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
17437,L97368,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I want you to hurt me.
17438,L97367,u574,m36,JEFFREY,What do you want?
17439,L97366,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything."
17440,L97365,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Whatiya mean?
17441,L97364,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Are you a bad boy?
17442,L97363,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I'm doing it.
17443,L97362,u571,m36,DOROTHY,What do you want to do?
17444,L97360,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Sure I do.
17445,L97359,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Do you like my body?
17446,L97358,u574,m36,JEFFREY,That's good.
17447,L97357,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
17448,L97356,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I sure don't hate you.
17449,L97355,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me."
17450,L97354,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Frank is coming?
17451,L97353,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Yes. Frank--
17452,L97352,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy."
17453,L97351,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"It used to make me laugh, but."
17454,L97350,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Hello.
17455,L97349,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Come in.
17456,L97200,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Please, please stay."
17457,L97199,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No. I should go.
17458,L97198,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
17459,L97197,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes.
17460,L97196,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?"
17461,L97195,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?"
17462,L97194,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
17463,L97193,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No. But you're in very big trouble.
17464,L97192,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Don? Are you in with them?
17465,L97191,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Who is Don?
17466,L97190,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?"
17467,L97189,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Falling.
17468,L97188,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No.
17469,L97187,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Look.
17470,L97185,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
17471,L97184,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
17472,L97183,u574,m36,JEFFREY,There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
17473,L97182,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
17474,L97181,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Who's it, you mean."
17475,L97180,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Nice guy. Who's he?
17476,L97168,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
17477,L97167,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Frank? Can you stand up?
17478,L97166,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Oh shit.
17479,L97165,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Same here.
17480,L97164,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I liked being with you last night.
17481,L97163,u574,m36,JEFFREY,That's not crazy. I like you too.
17482,L97162,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you."
17483,L97161,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I, uh."
17484,L97160,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Why are you here. Whatiya want?
17485,L97157,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Yeah, hurry up though."
17486,L97156,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Hi, can I come in?"
17487,L97137,u574,m36,JEFFREY,OK.
17488,L97136,u571,m36,DOROTHY,It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
17489,L97135,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Don't say that.
17490,L97134,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die."
17491,L97133,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Then don't talk about killing.
17492,L97132,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
17493,L97131,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
17494,L97130,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
17495,L97129,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No. What is happening?
17496,L97128,u571,m36,DOROTHY,You don't?
17497,L97127,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No.

17499,L97125,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
17500,L97123,u574,m36,JEFFREY,What?
17501,L97122,u571,m36,DOROTHY,I made it go down the toilet.
17502,L97119,u571,m36,DOROTHY,You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
17503,L97118,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Yes, I like you."
17504,L97117,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Do you like me?
17505,L97115,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"No, please. I won't."
17506,L97114,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"You can hit me, if you want to."
17507,L97111,u571,m36,DOROTHY,You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
17508,L97110,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes.

17510,L97108,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes.
17511,L97107,u571,m36,DOROTHY,See my breasts? See?
17512,L97106,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes.
17513,L97105,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Do you like the way I feel?
17514,L97104,u574,m36,JEFFREY,It's okay. It's okay.
17515,L97103,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Thank you. honey.
17516,L97102,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
17517,L97101,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No.
17518,L97100,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Don?
17519,L97099,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I'll go then.
17520,L97098,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Sure I'm alright.
17521,L97097,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Nothing. Are you alright?
17522,L97096,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
17523,L97075,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Lie down on the bed.
17524,L97074,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No.

17569,L97175,u581,m36,YELLOW MAN,"Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs."

17587,L97488,u571,m36,DOROTHY,Frank?
17588,L97487,u573,m36,FRANK,"Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too."
17589,L97486,u571,m36,DOROTHY,"Where are we going, Frank?"
17590,L97427,u573,m36,FRANK,From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?

17601,L97686,u572,m36,F.B.I. MAN,"We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch."
17602,L97685,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
17603,L97684,u572,m36,F.B.I. MAN,You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
17604,L97683,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue."
17605,L97682,u572,m36,F.B.I. MAN,"We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?"
17606,L97512,u573,m36,FRANK,"I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!"
17607,L97511,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes.
17608,L97510,u573,m36,FRANK,"Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?"
17609,L97495,u573,m36,FRANK,"Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?"
17610,L97494,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Nothing.
17611,L97493,u573,m36,FRANK,What are you lookin' at?
17612,L97485,u573,m36,FRANK,Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
17613,L97484,u574,m36,JEFFREY,What?

17637,L97143,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Nothing. I'm fine.
17638,L97142,u577,m36,MRS. BEAUMONT,Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
17639,L97141,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"God, you scared me."
17640,L96985,u577,m36,MRS. BEAUMONT,"Of course, Jeffrey."

17645,L96822,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I'm going out for awhile.
17646,L96786,u577,m36,MRS. BEAUMONT,"Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so."
17647,L96785,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Thanks a lot, Mom."
17648,L96784,u577,m36,MRS. BEAUMONT,"It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him."
17649,L96783,u574,m36,JEFFREY,What?
17650,L96782,u577,m36,MRS. BEAUMONT,He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
17651,L96781,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah?
17652,L96780,u577,m36,MRS. BEAUMONT,"Jeffrey, when you see your father."

17660,L96756,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Mom.
17661,L96755,u577,m36,MRS. BEAUMONT,"Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store."
17662,L96754,u574,m36,JEFFREY,For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
17663,L96753,u577,m36,MRS. BEAUMONT,"I mean, for good, Jeffrey."

17667,L97250,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?"
17668,L97249,u578,m36,MRS. WILLIAMS,"Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes."
17669,L97237,u578,m36,MRS. WILLIAMS,"Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute."

17682,L96833,u578,m36,MRS. WILLIAMS,I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
17683,L96832,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Alright.
17684,L96831,u578,m36,MRS. WILLIAMS,"Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?"
17685,L96830,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go."
17686,L96829,u578,m36,MRS. WILLIAMS,"Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?"
17687,L96828,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?"

17724,L97610,u580,m36,SANDY,Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
17725,L97604,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes.
17726,L97603,u580,m36,SANDY,Dorothy Vallens?
17727,L97602,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Dorothy!... Dorothy!
17728,L97595,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you."
17729,L97594,u580,m36,SANDY,No.
17730,L97593,u574,m36,JEFFREY,My father has a gun at home.
17731,L97590,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Frank!!!
17732,L97589,u580,m36,SANDY,Oh my God. What's wrong?
17733,L97586,u580,m36,SANDY,Okay.
17734,L97585,u574,m36,JEFFREY,You want to dance?
17735,L97583,u580,m36,SANDY,Just a minute.
17736,L97582,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Let's wait for some slow one.
17737,L97581,u580,m36,SANDY,NO.
17738,L97580,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Really. You want to dance with someone else?
17739,L97579,u580,m36,SANDY,Really?
17740,L97578,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I can't dance fast.
17741,L97577,u580,m36,SANDY,You want to dance?
17742,L97576,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I like that idea, that's a real good idea."
17743,L97575,u580,m36,SANDY,Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
17744,L97574,u574,m36,JEFFREY,You look beautiful.
17745,L97573,u580,m36,SANDY,It's okay.
17746,L97572,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
17747,L97571,u580,m36,SANDY,Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
17748,L97570,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Where to?
17749,L97569,u580,m36,SANDY,It's good to see you.
17750,L97568,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Nothing, really! It's good to see you."
17751,L97567,u580,m36,SANDY,What was that all about?
17752,L97563,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Just some fatherly advice.
17753,L97562,u580,m36,SANDY,What is it?
17754,L97561,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Okay.
17755,L97554,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Okay. Great!
17756,L97553,u580,m36,SANDY,I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
17757,L97552,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No.
17758,L97551,u580,m36,SANDY,You didn't tell him about me?
17759,L97550,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
17760,L97549,u580,m36,SANDY,Everything okay?
17761,L97525,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before."
17762,L97524,u580,m36,SANDY,"Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it."
17763,L97523,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble."
17764,L97348,u580,m36,SANDY,"Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this."
17765,L97347,u574,m36,JEFFREY,You worry about me really?
17766,L97344,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much."
17767,L97343,u580,m36,SANDY,You like mysteries that much?
17768,L97342,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
17769,L97341,u580,m36,SANDY,Jeffrey? Why?
17770,L97340,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah.
17771,L97339,u580,m36,SANDY,I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
17772,L97338,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
17773,L97337,u580,m36,SANDY,Jeffrey!!
17774,L97336,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
17775,L97335,u580,m36,SANDY,Oh yeah?
17776,L97334,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
17777,L97333,u580,m36,SANDY,"Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other."
17778,L97332,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?"
17779,L97331,u580,m36,SANDY,Shoot.
17780,L97330,u574,m36,JEFFREY,That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
17781,L97329,u580,m36,SANDY,"You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals."
17782,L97328,u580,m36,SANDY,"Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later."
17783,L97327,u574,m36,JEFFREY,You want to go talk to him?
17784,L97326,u580,m36,SANDY,What am I going to do?
17785,L97325,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I'm really sorry.
17786,L97324,u580,m36,SANDY,You were late.
17787,L97307,u574,m36,JEFFREY,See ya tomorrow.
17788,L97306,u580,m36,SANDY,Goodnight.
17789,L97305,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Okay, okay."
17790,L97304,u580,m36,SANDY,"You better not, Jeffrey."
17791,L97303,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Can I give you a kiss good night?
17792,L97302,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Okay, Sandy."
17793,L97301,u580,m36,SANDY,"Okay, be careful."
17794,L97300,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?"
17795,L97299,u580,m36,SANDY,"No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey."
17796,L97298,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
17797,L97297,u580,m36,SANDY,So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
17798,L97296,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
17799,L97295,u580,m36,SANDY,"I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble."
17800,L97294,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
17801,L97293,u580,m36,SANDY,You're sure right. It is a strange world.
17802,L97292,u574,m36,JEFFREY,That's what I thought.
17803,L97291,u580,m36,SANDY,"Who, me? Why should it?"
17804,L97290,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"That doesn't bother you, does it?"
17805,L97289,u580,m36,SANDY,Yeah?
17806,L97288,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Yeah. I mean a little, you know."
17807,L97287,u580,m36,SANDY,Did you see her undressed?
17808,L97286,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes.
17809,L97285,u580,m36,SANDY,Twice. Without her sensing anything?
17810,L97284,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Actually. I've been in twice.
17811,L97283,u580,m36,SANDY,You saw a lot in one night.
17812,L97282,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble."
17813,L97281,u580,m36,SANDY,Wow. Should you tell my father?
17814,L97280,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the ""yellow man"". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man."
17815,L97279,u580,m36,SANDY,You want to tell me about it?
17816,L97278,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No way. I'm about to blow up.
17817,L97277,u580,m36,SANDY,You want a Dairy Queen?
17818,L97276,u580,m36,SANDY,It's okay. Don't worry about it.
17819,L97275,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I'm sorry, I didn't..."
17820,L97274,u580,m36,SANDY,He got a little jealous.
17821,L97273,u574,m36,JEFFREY,What's with Mike?
17822,L97242,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?"
17823,L97241,u580,m36,SANDY,What did you see?
17824,L97240,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved."
17825,L97239,u580,m36,SANDY,"Well, how did it go? What happened?"
17826,L97027,u580,m36,SANDY,"Okay, okay. Bye."
17827,L97026,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?"
17828,L97025,u580,m36,SANDY,I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
17829,L97024,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Okay, thanks."
17830,L97023,u580,m36,SANDY,I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
17831,L97022,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Are you sure?
17832,L97021,u580,m36,SANDY,I'm going to wait here until she comes.
17833,L97020,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah.
17834,L97019,u580,m36,SANDY,Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
17835,L97018,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Look, it can wait till Sunday."
17836,L97017,u580,m36,SANDY,"Okay, yeah, call."
17837,L97016,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Oh, okay, can I call?"
17838,L97015,u580,m36,SANDY,"I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over."
17839,L97014,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went."
17840,L97013,u580,m36,SANDY,I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
17841,L97012,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit."
17842,L97011,u580,m36,SANDY,OK.
17843,L97010,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?"
17844,L97009,u580,m36,SANDY,"Yeah, but."
17845,L97008,u574,m36,JEFFREY,It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
17846,L97007,u580,m36,SANDY,"It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you."
17847,L97006,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Why not?
17848,L97005,u580,m36,SANDY,"Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it."
17849,L97003,u580,m36,SANDY,I'll drink to that.
17850,L97002,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Here's to. An interesting experience.
17851,L96997,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Two.
17852,L96996,u580,m36,SANDY,That sounds good.
17853,L96990,u580,m36,SANDY,This is not my usual Friday night!
17854,L96989,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
17855,L96988,u580,m36,SANDY,Brilliant.
17856,L96987,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment."
17857,L96986,u580,m36,SANDY,What's the plan.
17858,L96974,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
17859,L96973,u580,m36,SANDY,"Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock."
17860,L96972,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
17861,L96971,u580,m36,SANDY,"I already know. The ""Slow Club"". It's on Route 7."
17862,L96970,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings."
17863,L96969,u580,m36,SANDY,"I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?"
17864,L96968,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder."
17865,L96967,u580,m36,SANDY,"You really want to do this, don't you?"
17866,L96966,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that."
17867,L96965,u580,m36,SANDY,Yes. I do.
17868,L96964,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?"
17869,L96963,u580,m36,SANDY,"I owe you, since I goofed up this one."
17870,L96962,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
17871,L96961,u580,m36,SANDY,"So, what's next?"
17872,L96959,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah.
17873,L96958,u580,m36,SANDY,"Yeah, if it opens the door."
17874,L96957,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?"
17875,L96956,u580,m36,SANDY,No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
17876,L96955,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
17877,L96954,u580,m36,SANDY,"I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?"
17878,L96953,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?"
17879,L96952,u580,m36,SANDY,Are you alright?
17880,L96941,u580,m36,SANDY,"Alright. Good luck, yourself."
17881,L96940,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner."
17882,L96939,u580,m36,SANDY,"Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy."
17883,L96938,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?"
17884,L96937,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Let's go.
17885,L96936,u580,m36,SANDY,Alright.
17886,L96935,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?"
17887,L96934,u580,m36,SANDY,You've got a point there.
17888,L96933,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this."
17889,L96932,u580,m36,SANDY,"I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous."
17890,L96931,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few ""Awake"" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?"
17891,L96930,u580,m36,SANDY,What will I say when she comes to the door?
17892,L96929,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window."
17893,L96928,u580,m36,SANDY,"Now, how are you going to do that?"
17894,L96927,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
17895,L96926,u580,m36,SANDY,"It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess."
17896,L96925,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?"
17897,L96924,u580,m36,SANDY,You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
17898,L96923,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe."
17899,L96922,u580,m36,SANDY,"Alright, now tell me. What is it?"
17900,L96921,u580,m36,SANDY,"Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart."
17901,L96920,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
17902,L96919,u580,m36,SANDY,"I'm here, aren't I?"
17903,L96918,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I don't want to cause any trouble.
17904,L96916,u580,m36,SANDY,"Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute."
17905,L96915,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I'd like to talk to you about something.
17906,L96914,u580,m36,SANDY,I don't know.
17907,L96913,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"You hungry or thirsty, or both?"
17908,L96909,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Yeah. Good bye.
17909,L96908,u580,m36,SANDY,I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
17910,L96907,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I guess I'll see you sometime.
17911,L96906,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
17912,L96905,u580,m36,SANDY,I've gotta go in.
17913,L96904,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I don't know. He moved away.
17914,L96903,u580,m36,SANDY,What happened to him?
17915,L96902,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world."
17916,L96901,u580,m36,SANDY,"Still, it must be kinda rough."
17917,L96900,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice."
17918,L96899,u580,m36,SANDY,"Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?"
17919,L96898,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"You really do hear a lot, don't you?"
17920,L96897,u580,m36,SANDY,"My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered."
17921,L96896,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
17922,L96895,u580,m36,SANDY,"I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case."
17923,L96894,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
17924,L96893,u580,m36,SANDY,"I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you."
17925,L96892,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Where are they?
17926,L96891,u580,m36,SANDY,"That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching."
17927,L96890,u580,m36,SANDY,"Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you."
17928,L96889,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I guess you have to get back home soon?
17929,L96888,u580,m36,SANDY,"Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her."
17930,L96887,u574,m36,JEFFREY,It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
17931,L96886,u580,m36,SANDY,Maybe so.
17932,L96885,u574,m36,JEFFREY,The ear is from a missing person maybe?
17933,L96884,u580,m36,SANDY,"No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts."
17934,L96883,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
17935,L96882,u580,m36,SANDY,"There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others."
17936,L96881,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
17937,L96880,u580,m36,SANDY,"I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names."
17938,L96879,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?"
17939,L96878,u580,m36,SANDY,Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
17940,L96877,u574,m36,JEFFREY,What do you know about the ear? Anything?
17941,L96876,u580,m36,SANDY,That's too bad.
17942,L96875,u574,m36,JEFFREY,I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
17943,L96874,u580,m36,SANDY,Yeah. What are you doing now?
17944,L96873,u574,m36,JEFFREY,What else is new? Right?
17945,L96872,u580,m36,SANDY,Terrible boring.
17946,L96871,u574,m36,JEFFREY,How is Central these days?
17947,L96870,u580,m36,SANDY,Yes.
17948,L96869,u574,m36,JEFFREY,No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
17949,L96868,u580,m36,SANDY,Am I bothering you?
17950,L96867,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something."
17951,L96866,u580,m36,SANDY,You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
17952,L96865,u574,m36,JEFFREY,Oh yeah?
17953,L96864,u580,m36,SANDY,"I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central."
17954,L96863,u574,m36,JEFFREY,"Yeah, how did you know?"
17955,L97601,u575,m36,MIKE,You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
17956,L97600,u580,m36,SANDY,Stop it Mike.
17957,L97599,u575,m36,MIKE,"Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house."
17958,L97248,u580,m36,SANDY,Okay.
17959,L97247,u575,m36,MIKE,"Come on out a minute, okay?"
17960,L97246,u580,m36,SANDY,"Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me."
17961,L97245,u575,m36,MIKE,Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
17962,L97234,u580,m36,SANDY,Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
17963,L97233,u575,m36,MIKE,I don't know why we have to watch TV.
17964,L97232,u580,m36,SANDY,You can change it if you want to.
17965,L97231,u575,m36,MIKE,What are watchin' this junk for?
17966,L96842,u575,m36,MIKE,"Yeah, nice meetin' you."
17967,L96841,u580,m36,SANDY,Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
17968,L102220,u596,m37,SMECKER,Oh fuck!
17969,L102219,u582,m37,AUGUSTUS,Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
17970,L102218,u596,m37,SMECKER,Up where?
17971,L102217,u582,m37,AUGUSTUS,"Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there."
17972,L102216,u596,m37,SMECKER,Just for him?
17973,L102215,u582,m37,AUGUSTUS,Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
17974,L102214,u596,m37,SMECKER,What did he bring him in for?
17975,L102075,u582,m37,AUGUSTUS,Go find one.
17976,L102074,u598,m37,YAKAVETTA,There's ways around that.
17977,L102071,u582,m37,AUGUSTUS,"Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster."
17978,L102070,u598,m37,YAKAVETTA,"Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something."
17979,L102069,u582,m37,AUGUSTUS,"Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here."
17980,L102068,u598,m37,YAKAVETTA,"This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it."
17981,L102067,u582,m37,AUGUSTUS,The Duke?  What did you do?
17982,L102066,u598,m37,YAKAVETTA,I need Il Duce.
17983,L102065,u582,m37,AUGUSTUS,"Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?"
17984,L102064,u598,m37,YAKAVETTA,"Hey, I just..."
17985,L102063,u582,m37,AUGUSTUS,"I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?"
17986,L102062,u598,m37,YAKAVETTA,"Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around."
17987,L102061,u582,m37,AUGUSTUS,Fuck you.
17988,L101583,u583,m37,BOTH,Aye.
17989,L101582,u591,m37,MOM,Are ya ready?
17990,L101572,u591,m37,MOM,"I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!"
17991,L101571,u583,m37,BOTH,Yes mother.
17992,L101570,u591,m37,MOM,"Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'."
17993,L101565,u591,m37,MOM,"What did you do, Connor?"
17994,L101564,u583,m37,BOTH,"Mother Mary, full of grace."
17995,L101563,u591,m37,MOM,Lord's name.
17996,L101718,u596,m37,SMECKER,You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
17997,L101717,u584,m37,CHAFFEY,The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
17998,L101716,u596,m37,SMECKER,What?
17999,L101715,u584,m37,CHAFFEY,"Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem."
18000,L101654,u596,m37,SMECKER,Any word back from the E.R.s?
18001,L101653,u584,m37,CHAFFEY,Any tips on where these guys may be?
18002,L101652,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one."
18003,L101650,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah."
18004,L101649,u584,m37,CHAFFEY,Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
18005,L101615,u584,m37,CHAFFEY,Got it.
18006,L101614,u596,m37,SMECKER,Look under the body.
18007,L101613,u584,m37,CHAFFEY,"I can't find the second one, sir."
18008,L101612,u596,m37,SMECKER,Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
18009,L101606,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something."
18010,L101605,u584,m37,CHAFFEY,Yes sir.
18011,L102228,u594,m37,ROCCO,You gotta keep going.
18012,L102227,u585,m37,CONNOR,We're here brother.
18013,L102226,u594,m37,ROCCO,You guys?
18014,L102162,u594,m37,ROCCO,"You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man."
18015,L102161,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Let him go or I will deliver you, right now."
18016,L102160,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing."
18017,L102159,u585,m37,CONNOR,You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
18018,L102133,u585,m37,CONNOR,"This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will."
18019,L102132,u594,m37,ROCCO,They got nothing.
18020,L102129,u594,m37,ROCCO,"What?  What, that guy?"
18021,L102128,u585,m37,CONNOR,Shit.
18022,L102108,u594,m37,ROCCO,I know what the fuck he looks like!
18023,L102107,u585,m37,CONNOR,Look again for fuck sake!
18024,L102086,u594,m37,ROCCO,Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
18025,L102085,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!"
18026,L102060,u594,m37,ROCCO,C'mon!
18027,L102059,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit."
18028,L102058,u594,m37,ROCCO,"You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit."
18029,L102054,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco."
18030,L102053,u585,m37,CONNOR,No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
18031,L102052,u594,m37,ROCCO,Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
18032,L102049,u585,m37,CONNOR,This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
18033,L102048,u594,m37,ROCCO,What? What is it?
18034,L102044,u594,m37,ROCCO,I-I'll tip her.
18035,L102043,u585,m37,CONNOR,What the fuck are you doing?
18036,L102025,u594,m37,ROCCO,"MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!"
18037,L102024,u585,m37,CONNOR,I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
18038,L102021,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?"
18039,L102020,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Yeah, well..."
18040,L102013,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man."
18041,L102012,u585,m37,CONNOR,Anybody see ya?
18042,L101983,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!"
18043,L101982,u594,m37,ROCCO,What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
18044,L101970,u594,m37,ROCCO,"I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!"
18045,L101969,u585,m37,CONNOR,What happened?
18046,L101968,u594,m37,ROCCO,Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
18047,L101903,u594,m37,ROCCO,"No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled."
18048,L101902,u585,m37,CONNOR,Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
18049,L101901,u594,m37,ROCCO,"No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it."
18050,L101900,u585,m37,CONNOR,"He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?"
18051,L101899,u594,m37,ROCCO,"No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?"
18052,L101898,u585,m37,CONNOR,"He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?"
18053,L101897,u594,m37,ROCCO,You think they sold me out? No way.
18054,L101896,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets."
18055,L101895,u594,m37,ROCCO,What are you saying?
18056,L101894,u585,m37,CONNOR,Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
18057,L101893,u594,m37,ROCCO,What?
18058,L101892,u585,m37,CONNOR,Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
18059,L101891,u594,m37,ROCCO,She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
18060,L101890,u585,m37,CONNOR,You sound real remorseful.
18061,L101889,u594,m37,ROCCO,Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
18062,L101888,u585,m37,CONNOR,Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
18063,L101885,u594,m37,ROCCO,Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
18064,L101884,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco."
18065,L101869,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison."
18066,L101868,u594,m37,ROCCO,Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
18067,L101867,u585,m37,CONNOR,Yes.
18068,L101866,u594,m37,ROCCO,Anybody you think is evil?
18069,L101862,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Get a hold of yourself, man."
18070,L101861,u594,m37,ROCCO,"What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!"
18071,L101860,u585,m37,CONNOR,Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
18072,L101859,u594,m37,ROCCO,"What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!"
18073,L101856,u585,m37,CONNOR,Let's do him right here.
18074,L101855,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?"
18075,L101852,u585,m37,CONNOR,This is a six-shooter.
18076,L101851,u594,m37,ROCCO,Chest pocket.  Shit!
18077,L101850,u585,m37,CONNOR,Where's your gun?
18078,L101849,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!"
18079,L101581,u591,m37,MOM,"All right, I suppose you have the right ta know."
18080,L101580,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?"
18081,L101579,u591,m37,MOM,"Still bickerin' over that, huh?"
18082,L101576,u591,m37,MOM,"Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'."
18083,L101575,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Yeah, we promise."
18084,L101568,u585,m37,CONNOR,"Well, I didn't but..."

18097,L101530,u591,m37,MOM,"It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for."

18107,L102208,u585,m37,CONNOR,I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.

18131,L102268,u592,m37,MURPHY,There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
18132,L102267,u585,m37,CONNOR,These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
18133,L102266,u592,m37,MURPHY,"Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace."

18200,L101709,u592,m37,MURPHY,How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
18201,L101695,u592,m37,MURPHY,"""I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."""
18202,L101694,u585,m37,CONNOR,"""Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"""

18231,L101512,u595,m37,ROZ,I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
18232,L101505,u595,m37,ROZ,Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
18233,L101504,u585,m37,CONNOR,Yeah?

18237,L101494,u595,m37,ROZ,I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
18238,L101955,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends."
18239,L101954,u587,m37,DOLLY,How do you figure?
18240,L101953,u596,m37,SMECKER,"The shooter knew these guys, huh?"
18241,L101943,u587,m37,DOLLY,That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
18242,L101942,u596,m37,SMECKER,And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
18243,L101939,u596,m37,SMECKER,No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
18244,L101938,u587,m37,DOLLY,Maybe the three of them had something in common.
18245,L101929,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here."
18246,L101928,u587,m37,DOLLY,"Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?"
18247,L101927,u587,m37,DOLLY,Three.
18248,L101926,u596,m37,SMECKER,Of course they were. How many?
18249,L101925,u587,m37,DOLLY,They were wearing masks.
18250,L101924,u596,m37,SMECKER,Can she I.D. them?
18251,L101923,u587,m37,DOLLY,She was in here when it went down.
18252,L101825,u596,m37,SMECKER,That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
18253,L101824,u587,m37,DOLLY,"So, what do we do now?"
18254,L101813,u596,m37,SMECKER,Fan-fuckin-tastic!
18255,L101812,u587,m37,DOLLY,Uh... two shooters!
18256,L101811,u596,m37,SMECKER,"And number three, Dolly."
18257,L101804,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology."
18258,L101803,u587,m37,DOLLY,Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
18259,L101998,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Male or female, bitch?!!"
18260,L101997,u588,m37,DONNA,It was... It was...
18261,L101996,u594,m37,ROCCO,Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
18262,L101995,u588,m37,DONNA,Pee...Per...Man.
18263,L101994,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little..."
18264,L101993,u588,m37,DONNA,"My, my..."
18265,L101992,u594,m37,ROCCO,Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
18266,L101991,u588,m37,DONNA,You killed my... my...
18267,L101990,u594,m37,ROCCO,I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
18268,L101989,u588,m37,DONNA,"You... oh god, why?"
18269,L101988,u594,m37,ROCCO,"I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!"
18270,L101987,u588,m37,DONNA,Where's my cat?
18271,L101986,u594,m37,ROCCO,What?
18272,L101974,u588,m37,DONNA,Rocco!
18273,L101973,u594,m37,ROCCO,No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
18274,L101961,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet."
18275,L101960,u589,m37,DUFFY,"Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking."
18276,L101959,u596,m37,SMECKER,Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
18277,L101958,u589,m37,DUFFY,Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
18278,L101957,u596,m37,SMECKER,"These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?"
18279,L101947,u596,m37,SMECKER,Why was I not informed of this?
18280,L101946,u589,m37,DUFFY,A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
18281,L101945,u596,m37,SMECKER,What?
18282,L101944,u589,m37,DUFFY,Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
18283,L101937,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?"
18284,L101936,u589,m37,DUFFY,No way they could have seen it?
18285,L101935,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time."
18286,L101823,u596,m37,SMECKER,"And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out."
18287,L101822,u589,m37,DUFFY,It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
18288,L101821,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?"
18289,L101816,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two."
18290,L101815,u589,m37,DUFFY,What about one guy with two guns?
18291,L101814,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!"
18292,L101808,u596,m37,SMECKER,Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
18293,L101807,u589,m37,DUFFY,They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
18294,L101806,u596,m37,SMECKER,"The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy."
18295,L101799,u589,m37,DUFFY,The Sicilians.
18296,L101798,u596,m37,SMECKER,The Greeks. The Italians.
18297,L101797,u589,m37,DUFFY,"Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver."
18298,L101796,u596,m37,SMECKER,"That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent."
18299,L101795,u589,m37,DUFFY,New hitman wants to leave his mark
18300,L101794,u596,m37,SMECKER,And the pennies?
18301,L101793,u589,m37,DUFFY,He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
18302,L101792,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?"
18303,L101791,u589,m37,DUFFY,The fat man.
18304,L101790,u596,m37,SMECKER,The what man?
18305,L101789,u589,m37,DUFFY,"These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the..."
18306,L101788,u596,m37,SMECKER,"So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie."
18307,L101621,u596,m37,SMECKER,Really want to know?
18308,L101620,u589,m37,DUFFY,So what are you thinkin' here?
18309,L102122,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?"
18310,L102121,u590,m37,GREENLY,What if it was just one guy with six guns?
18311,L101951,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!"
18312,L101950,u590,m37,GREENLY,A couple of peons for the mob and...
18313,L101949,u596,m37,SMECKER,Who were the victims?
18314,L101948,u590,m37,GREENLY,They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
18315,L101934,u596,m37,SMECKER,No way they could have seen it.
18316,L101933,u590,m37,GREENLY,Witness?
18317,L101932,u596,m37,SMECKER,"After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?"
18318,L101810,u596,m37,SMECKER,"It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!"
18319,L101809,u590,m37,GREENLY,"Uh.  Shit, I, uh..."
18320,L101787,u590,m37,GREENLY,Shit! Shit!
18321,L101786,u596,m37,SMECKER,"While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?"
18322,L101784,u590,m37,GREENLY,Eight.
18323,L101783,u596,m37,SMECKER,"How many bodies, Greenly?"
18324,L101782,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table."
18325,L101781,u590,m37,GREENLY,Why do you always disrespect me like that?
18326,L101780,u596,m37,SMECKER,"He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?"
18327,L101600,u596,m37,SMECKER,Sweet-n-low!
18328,L101599,u590,m37,GREENLY,"Chief, what the fuck is this?"
18329,L101598,u596,m37,SMECKER,Twist of lemon!
18330,L101597,u590,m37,GREENLY,Who the...
18331,L101591,u590,m37,GREENLY,Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
18332,L101590,u596,m37,SMECKER,Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
18333,L101589,u590,m37,GREENLY,"That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up."
18334,L101574,u592,m37,MURPHY,We promise.
18335,L101573,u591,m37,MOM,Promise me boys.
18336,L101557,u592,m37,MURPHY,Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
18337,L101556,u591,m37,MOM,"But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl."
18338,L101553,u592,m37,MURPHY,Just called ta torture us did ya?
18339,L101552,u591,m37,MOM,It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
18340,L101550,u591,m37,MOM,"Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now."
18341,L101549,u592,m37,MURPHY,"Oh, she's quite proud of herself."
18342,L101541,u591,m37,MOM,I...
18343,L101540,u592,m37,MURPHY,Oh my god!
18344,L101536,u591,m37,MOM,I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
18345,L101535,u592,m37,MURPHY,What the...?
18346,L102230,u594,m37,ROCCO,"You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever."
18347,L102229,u592,m37,MURPHY,"We'll keep going, Roc."
18348,L102147,u592,m37,MURPHY,We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
18349,L102146,u594,m37,ROCCO,Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
18350,L102135,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility."
18351,L102134,u592,m37,MURPHY,You bet your ass he will.
18352,L102106,u594,m37,ROCCO,I mean he ain't here.
18353,L102105,u592,m37,MURPHY,What the fuck do you mean?
18354,L102104,u594,m37,ROCCO,Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
18355,L102088,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!"
18356,L102087,u592,m37,MURPHY,Well he sure as fuck knew you!
18357,L102083,u592,m37,MURPHY,"Well, I'm sold."
18358,L102082,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Worst day of my life, man."
18359,L102031,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no..."
18360,L102030,u592,m37,MURPHY,You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
18361,L102023,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Well, what'ya do?"
18362,L102022,u592,m37,MURPHY,"Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps."
18363,L102019,u594,m37,ROCCO,"So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?"
18364,L102018,u592,m37,MURPHY,So?
18365,L102017,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses."
18366,L102015,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Y'know it is, a bit."
18367,L102014,u592,m37,MURPHY,Liberating isn't it?
18368,L102006,u592,m37,MURPHY,You sure you killed them?
18369,L102005,u594,m37,ROCCO,Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
18370,L101979,u594,m37,ROCCO,Those cocksuckers sold me out!
18371,L101978,u592,m37,MURPHY,"This is some crazy shit, man!"
18372,L101977,u594,m37,ROCCO,Hurry the fuck up!
18373,L101967,u594,m37,ROCCO,I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.

18387,L101911,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!"
18388,L101910,u592,m37,MURPHY,"Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!"
18389,L101909,u594,m37,ROCCO,Fuck you!
18390,L101908,u592,m37,MURPHY,"Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!"
18391,L101907,u594,m37,ROCCO,Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
18392,L101883,u592,m37,MURPHY,"Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit."
18393,L101882,u594,m37,ROCCO,What are you serious?
18394,L101881,u592,m37,MURPHY,Who says that? You could take credit on it.
18395,L101880,u594,m37,ROCCO,You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
18396,L101878,u592,m37,MURPHY,"We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open."
18397,L101877,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Well fuck, you guys could do this every day."
18398,L101876,u594,m37,ROCCO,"So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?"
18399,L101875,u592,m37,MURPHY,"Hallelujah, Jaffar."
18400,L101874,u594,m37,ROCCO,"This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?"
18401,L101858,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny."
18402,L101857,u592,m37,MURPHY,Right now.
18403,L102201,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen."
18404,L102200,u593,m37,PRIEST,Forgive me father.
18405,L102199,u596,m37,SMECKER,"Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them."
18406,L102198,u593,m37,PRIEST,The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
18407,L102194,u596,m37,SMECKER,No. They would never do that.
18408,L102193,u593,m37,PRIEST,"Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?"
18409,L102192,u596,m37,SMECKER,Yes.
18410,L102191,u593,m37,PRIEST,You know them personally?
18411,L102190,u596,m37,SMECKER,I believe these young men are right.
18412,L102189,u593,m37,PRIEST,Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
18413,L102188,u596,m37,SMECKER,"I want to stand for what I believe in, father."
18414,L102187,u593,m37,PRIEST,Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
18415,L102186,u596,m37,SMECKER,You're right.
18416,L102185,u593,m37,PRIEST,"It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand."
18417,L102184,u596,m37,SMECKER,I guess not.
18418,L102183,u593,m37,PRIEST,You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
18419,L102182,u596,m37,SMECKER,Has he now?
18420,L102181,u593,m37,PRIEST,"You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day."
18421,L102180,u596,m37,SMECKER,Yes.
18422,L102179,u593,m37,PRIEST,You feel?
18423,L102178,u596,m37,SMECKER,Yes.
18424,L102177,u593,m37,PRIEST,You believe?
18425,L102176,u596,m37,SMECKER,But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
18426,L102175,u593,m37,PRIEST,God's permission? God doesn't...
18427,L102174,u596,m37,SMECKER,"It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically."
18428,L102173,u593,m37,PRIEST,What is it my son?
18429,L102172,u596,m37,SMECKER,Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
18430,L102171,u593,m37,PRIEST,Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
18431,L102164,u593,m37,PRIEST,Y-Yes my son.
18432,L102163,u596,m37,SMECKER,Hello? You there?
18433,L102203,u593,m37,PRIEST,Just go!
18434,L102202,u594,m37,ROCCO,"I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone."
18435,L102168,u593,m37,PRIEST,"How long since your last confession, my son?"
18436,L102167,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Just be natural, goddamit."
18437,L102166,u593,m37,PRIEST,What do you want me to say?
18438,L102165,u594,m37,ROCCO,Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
18439,L102158,u593,m37,PRIEST,God have mercy on my soul.
18440,L102157,u594,m37,ROCCO,"Father, I'll do you right here."
18441,L102156,u594,m37,ROCCO,"That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing."
18442,L102155,u593,m37,PRIEST,Have you no fear of God?
18443,L102154,u594,m37,ROCCO,Open it!
18444,L102153,u593,m37,PRIEST,Don't do this my son.
18445,L102152,u594,m37,ROCCO,Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
18446,L102151,u593,m37,PRIEST,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see."
18447,L102150,u594,m37,ROCCO,I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
18448,L102149,u593,m37,PRIEST,Yes.
18449,L102148,u594,m37,ROCCO,"You gonna do what I say, got it?"
18450,L101758,u594,m37,ROCCO,"He says, ""What's your third wish?"" And the guys says, ""I-I want you to beat me half to death."""
18451,L101757,u598,m37,YAKAVETTA,Continue the joke.

18480,L104245,u599,m38,ANTHONY,You're kidding.
18481,L104244,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I think I may have found a way out of here.
18482,L104237,u603,m38,DIGNAN,He stole a tractor.
18483,L104236,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What's he in for?
18484,L104231,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
18485,L104230,u599,m38,ANTHONY,So how is it in there?
18486,L104229,u599,m38,ANTHONY,We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
18487,L104228,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Does it float?
18488,L104227,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Behind Bob's house.
18489,L104226,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Where?

18491,L104222,u603,m38,DIGNAN,How big is it?
18492,L104221,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It belongs to Bob's uncle.
18493,L104220,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You're living on a sailboat?
18494,L104219,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Nothing.
18495,L104218,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What do you mean?
18496,L104217,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?"
18497,L104213,u599,m38,ANTHONY,We're not sure.
18498,L104212,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Why?
18499,L104211,u599,m38,ANTHONY,We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
18500,L104210,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You think Applejack knew?
18501,L104207,u603,m38,DIGNAN,The grandfather clock?
18502,L104206,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Pretty much everything.
18503,L104205,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What'd he get?
18504,L104204,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I'm not kidding.
18505,L104203,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You got to be kidding me.
18506,L104202,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Yeah.
18507,L104201,u603,m38,DIGNAN,He did?
18508,L104200,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house."
18509,L104199,u603,m38,DIGNAN,So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
18510,L104196,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Can't remember shit. CRS.
18511,L104195,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Like amnesia.
18512,L104180,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I don't think so.
18513,L104179,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Dignan, it's too late."
18514,L104178,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Yes, there is. Let's get organized."
18515,L104177,u599,m38,ANTHONY,There's not enough time.
18516,L104176,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I'll get him.
18517,L104175,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What are you talking about?
18518,L104174,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I'll see you there.
18519,L104173,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What?
18520,L104172,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I'll see you there.
18521,L104171,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Come on.
18522,L104164,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
18523,L104163,u599,m38,ANTHONY,You're kidding.
18524,L104159,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Come on, Kumar."
18525,L104158,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Wait for Kumar.
18526,L104156,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Let's go. Come on.
18527,L104155,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What are you doing?
18528,L104150,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?"
18529,L104149,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I don't know.
18530,L104148,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Where's Kumar?
18531,L104147,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
18532,L104146,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Who tripped the alarm?
18533,L104140,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Careful. Check his pulse.
18534,L104139,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Help me move him.
18535,L104132,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Get against the wall!
18536,L104131,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Nobody move!
18537,L104130,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Freeze!
18538,L104113,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Applejack! What's happening?
18539,L104112,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It's going back down.
18540,L104111,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Who did that? What the fuck is that?
18541,L104108,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
18542,L104107,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What's happening? What's going on?
18543,L104102,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
18544,L104101,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I don't know.
18545,L104098,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Stand by, Bird Dog."
18546,L104097,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
18547,L104096,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Good. It's supposed to be.
18548,L104095,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
18549,L104094,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Any activity?
18550,L104093,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"I'm in position, Scarecrow."
18551,L104086,u599,m38,ANTHONY,OK. Roger.

18554,L104075,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Hang on a second.
18555,L104074,u599,m38,ANTHONY,We all set?
18556,L104073,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Roger.
18557,L104072,u599,m38,ANTHONY,You're all clear.
18558,L104071,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Go ahead, Bird Dog."
18559,L104070,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
18560,L104062,u599,m38,ANTHONY,So do I.
18561,L104061,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Yes. I do.
18562,L104060,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Yeah. As a girl.
18563,L104059,u603,m38,DIGNAN,As a person?
18564,L104058,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Do you like Inez?
18565,L104057,u603,m38,DIGNAN,He was all right.
18566,L104056,u599,m38,ANTHONY,He was a nice guy.
18567,L104055,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
18568,L104054,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared."
18569,L104053,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I don't want to be too much of a liability.
18570,L104052,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I don't think you will.
18571,L104051,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
18572,L104049,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Did that hurt?
18573,L104048,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Or I might end up with a broken nose.
18574,L104047,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
18575,L104046,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Next week we'll be drinking pia coladas.
18576,L103960,u603,m38,DIGNAN,It's like we've finally arrived.
18577,L103959,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Yeah. It's pretty good.
18578,L103958,u603,m38,DIGNAN,God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.

18596,L103823,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Let me feel that.
18597,L103822,u599,m38,ANTHONY,You could give somebody a concussion.
18598,L103818,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Right now.
18599,L103817,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What time did he say to be here?
18600,L103813,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
18601,L103812,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What exactly is this place? Freezers?
18602,L103805,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
18603,L103804,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Who's Mr. Henry?
18604,L103803,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.

18627,L103712,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I had to give some to Inez.
18628,L103711,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Where's the rest?
18629,L103710,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I know.
18630,L103709,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Sixteen dollars.
18631,L103707,u603,m38,DIGNAN,That's not correct.
18632,L103706,u599,m38,ANTHONY,We've got sixteen dollars.
18633,L103705,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"You're so spoiled. What is ""not good"" to you? Only a few hundred --"
18634,L103704,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Our money situation is not good.
18635,L103703,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --"
18636,L103702,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I'm not. But there's --
18637,L103701,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Don't panic, Anthony."
18638,L103700,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I think we better go home.
18639,L103694,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram."
18640,L103693,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
18641,L103692,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Yes, I do. Bob taught me."
18642,L103691,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You don't know how to hotwire.
18643,L103690,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us."
18644,L103685,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
18645,L103684,u603,m38,DIGNAN,No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
18646,L103683,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Shh.
18647,L103682,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
18648,L103681,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"I don't know, Dignan. I just --"
18649,L103680,u603,m38,DIGNAN,She doesn't need to know.
18650,L103679,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
18651,L103678,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --"
18652,L103677,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I don't think we can do that.
18653,L103676,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?"
18654,L103675,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What?
18655,L103674,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I have an idea for that.
18656,L103673,u599,m38,ANTHONY,We need a car.
18657,L103672,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
18658,L103671,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
18659,L103670,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Would of been nice.
18660,L103669,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I wish I'd been there.
18661,L103668,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Can you hand me those french fries.
18662,L103667,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I can't believe he just jumped you.
18663,L103643,u603,m38,DIGNAN,OK.
18664,L103642,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Why don't you come with us.
18665,L103641,u603,m38,DIGNAN,No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
18666,L103640,u599,m38,ANTHONY,We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
18667,L103636,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Well, the world is a little bit colder today."
18668,L103635,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan."
18669,L103634,u603,m38,DIGNAN,If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
18670,L103633,u599,m38,ANTHONY,If you say so.
18671,L103632,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
18672,L103631,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
18673,L103630,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --"
18674,L103629,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Well, I didn't do it, did I?"
18675,L103628,u603,m38,DIGNAN,If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
18676,L103627,u599,m38,ANTHONY,He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
18677,L103626,u603,m38,DIGNAN,He told you and you let him do it.
18678,L103625,u599,m38,ANTHONY,You were asleep.
18679,L103624,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Where was I?
18680,L103623,u599,m38,ANTHONY,This morning.
18681,L103622,u603,m38,DIGNAN,When'd he tell you?
18682,L103618,u599,m38,ANTHONY,That's a long time to be in jail.
18683,L103617,u603,m38,DIGNAN,We said 48 hours.
18684,L103616,u599,m38,ANTHONY,He went back for his brother.
18685,L103615,u603,m38,DIGNAN,He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
18686,L103614,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Maybe he just went to the store.
18687,L103613,u603,m38,DIGNAN,That coward. Son of a bitch.
18688,L103612,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Right here.
18689,L103611,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Where was it parked?
18690,L103610,u603,m38,DIGNAN,He's gone. He stole the car.
18691,L103608,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Yes... It's true.
18692,L103607,u599,m38,ANTHONY,But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
18693,L103606,u603,m38,DIGNAN,They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
18694,L103605,u599,m38,ANTHONY,After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
18695,L103604,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead."
18696,L103603,u599,m38,ANTHONY,This was in fourth grade.
18697,L103602,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him."
18698,L103594,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Don't worry about it, Bob."
18699,L103593,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"See, now we've got a plan."
18700,L103589,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Bob?
18701,L103588,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Obviously. That's a given.
18702,L103587,u599,m38,ANTHONY,As long as he gets out OK.
18703,L103586,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
18704,L103583,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on."
18705,L103582,u603,m38,DIGNAN,He needs to hire an attorney.
18706,L103577,u603,m38,DIGNAN,No kidding.
18707,L103576,u599,m38,ANTHONY,She's from Cuba.
18708,L103575,u599,m38,ANTHONY,On the left.
18709,L103574,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Which one was that?
18710,L103573,u599,m38,ANTHONY,No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
18711,L103572,u603,m38,DIGNAN,They don't?
18712,L103571,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English."
18713,L103570,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?"
18714,L103569,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What. What's the matter?
18715,L103568,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What the fuck is going on here?
18716,L103567,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Sure.
18717,L103566,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"May I have a word with you, please?"
18718,L103565,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
18719,L103564,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Inez, this is --"
18720,L103563,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Hi.
18721,L103562,u599,m38,ANTHONY,This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
18722,L103560,u603,m38,DIGNAN,No. We didn't.
18723,L103559,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
18724,L103477,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
18725,L103476,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that."
18726,L103475,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car."
18727,L103474,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?"
18728,L103458,u603,m38,DIGNAN,True.
18729,L103457,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up."
18730,L103456,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over."
18731,L103455,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It's not a plan. It's just --
18732,L103454,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
18733,L103453,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
18734,L103452,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony."
18735,L103451,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
18736,L103450,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know."
18737,L103449,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts."
18738,L103442,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Bob?
18739,L103441,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You owe me fifty bucks.
18740,L103440,u603,m38,DIGNAN,On your marks...  Get set go.
18741,L103439,u599,m38,ANTHONY,OK. Go ahead.
18742,L103438,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I'll say it.
18743,L103437,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I'll just say it.
18744,L103434,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You were spoiled rotten.
18745,L103433,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Don't call me spoiled, Dignan."
18746,L103432,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled."
18747,L103431,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E."
18748,L103430,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes."
18749,L103427,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those."
18750,L103426,u599,m38,ANTHONY,They obviously weren't designed for racing.
18751,L103425,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What about them?
18752,L103424,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Look at the treads on those.
18753,L103423,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Yes, they are."
18754,L103422,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Dignan, those aren't running shoes."
18755,L103421,u603,m38,DIGNAN,See if mine are in there.
18756,L103419,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that..."
18757,L103418,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I keep it for emergencies.
18758,L103417,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Well, then cut it in half."
18759,L103416,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I don't want to use it.
18760,L103415,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"She's not going to notice, Anthony."
18761,L103414,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Because my mom gets the bill.
18762,L103413,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Why not?
18763,L103412,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan."
18764,L103411,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Can I get that credit card from you?
18765,L103343,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Don't even say it, man."
18766,L103342,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --"
18767,L103341,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do."
18768,L103340,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved."
18769,L103339,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What do you think?
18770,L103338,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What's wrong with him?
18771,L103330,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
18772,L103329,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Like he would find Dignan. One day.
18773,L103328,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Yeah.
18774,L103327,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Like he meant it.
18775,L103326,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
18776,L103323,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you."
18777,L103322,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What about what that guy said?
18778,L103317,u603,m38,DIGNAN,We got it. We got it.
18779,L103316,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Holy shit.
18780,L103297,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
18781,L103296,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Is that the manager?
18782,L103290,u603,m38,DIGNAN,We know there's another stocker.
18783,L103289,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"There's another stocker, right?"
18784,L103288,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Where's the other stocker?
18785,L103287,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Where's the manager?
18786,L103249,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You're right. You're right.
18787,L103248,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Calm down. Take a deep breath.
18788,L103247,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Dignan! Stop!
18789,L103246,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
18790,L103245,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Dignan, calm down."
18791,L103241,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours."
18792,L103240,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Anthony, give me the fucking gun!"
18793,L103234,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Nothing. Go ahead.
18794,L103233,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
18795,L103227,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --"
18796,L103226,u599,m38,ANTHONY,You think we're going to be chased?
18797,L103225,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --"
18798,L103214,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Just turn right here.
18799,L103213,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Loop around real fast.
18800,L103200,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Yeah.
18801,L103199,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Is it back in?
18802,L103190,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Hang on a second.
18803,L103189,u599,m38,ANTHONY,But he didn't say anything.
18804,L103156,u603,m38,DIGNAN,That's not bad.
18805,L103155,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Eight dollars.
18806,L103154,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
18807,L103153,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Five, seven, eight dollars."
18808,L103152,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Yeah, I heard that."
18809,L103151,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It had an alarm.
18810,L103150,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there."
18811,L103149,u599,m38,ANTHONY,That sets it off.
18812,L103148,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I don't think so. Just reach on in.
18813,L103147,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Dignan, it's got an alarm."
18814,L103146,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I'm lookout.
18815,L103145,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Yeah, I saw it."
18816,L103144,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Did you see that?
18817,L103143,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"That's not what I meant, Dignan."
18818,L103142,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
18819,L103141,u599,m38,ANTHONY,How was I ridiculing you?
18820,L103140,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
18821,L103139,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Where are you going?
18822,L103137,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?"
18823,L103136,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it."
18824,L103135,u599,m38,ANTHONY,That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
18825,L103134,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
18826,L103133,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. ""Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."""
18827,L103128,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that."
18828,L103127,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?"
18829,L103126,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at."
18830,L103114,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What do you think the cops have?
18831,L103113,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"It's got a V-8, Dignan."
18832,L103097,u603,m38,DIGNAN,She's an attractive older woman.
18833,L103096,u599,m38,ANTHONY,She's really kind of hot.
18834,L103092,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --"
18835,L103091,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
18836,L103090,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
18837,L103089,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Would they do that?
18838,L103088,u599,m38,ANTHONY,That's true. But what if they change the locks?
18839,L103087,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
18840,L103086,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Did you see what I meant about the window?
18841,L103085,u599,m38,ANTHONY,No. This is he.
18842,L103084,u603,m38,DIGNAN,This is he?
18843,L103083,u599,m38,ANTHONY,He says. This is he.
18844,L103082,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What does Starsky say?
18845,L103081,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name."
18846,L103080,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream."
18847,L103079,u599,m38,ANTHONY,As part of his plan. I don't know why.
18848,L103078,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Why?
18849,L103077,u599,m38,ANTHONY,No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
18850,L103076,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony."
18851,L103075,u599,m38,ANTHONY,He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
18852,L103074,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Plus where's Huggie Bear?
18853,L103073,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Dignan, it's --"
18854,L103072,u603,m38,DIGNAN,OK. That's wrong.
18855,L103071,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Right. The blond guy.
18856,L103070,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Making Hutch David Soul?
18857,L103069,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
18858,L103068,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What color hair does he have?
18859,L104045,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
18860,L104044,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Why'd you want to help us?
18861,L104043,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Absolutely.
18862,L104042,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?"
18863,L104041,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,We're renegades from despair.
18864,L104040,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,It's an esoteric journey.
18865,L104039,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Yeah.
18866,L104038,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,But you're thieves. It's what you are.
18867,L104036,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend."
18868,L104035,u599,m38,ANTHONY,This is good.
18869,L104011,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"Anthony, I'm petrified."
18870,L104010,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?"
18871,L104009,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
18872,L104008,u599,m38,ANTHONY,No. Bob did.
18873,L104007,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?"
18874,L104006,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Death.
18875,L104005,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Exactly. Woah.
18876,L104004,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man."
18877,L104003,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Are you afraid?
18878,L104002,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I don't want to die.
18879,L104001,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"No, that door over there."
18880,L104000,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Me?
18881,L103999,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?"
18882,L103986,u599,m38,ANTHONY,That sounds like Dignan.
18883,L103985,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses."
18884,L103984,u599,m38,ANTHONY,How'd he do?
18885,L103983,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"Yes, he did."
18886,L103982,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Did Dignan take the test?
18887,L103981,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It feels good.
18888,L103980,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,How does that feel?
18889,L103979,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Take a deep breath.
18890,L103978,u599,m38,ANTHONY,That was a test?
18891,L103977,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
18892,L103976,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What do you mean?
18893,L103975,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Congratulations. You passed the test.
18894,L103973,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Hold it.
18895,L103972,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend."
18896,L103970,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
18897,L103969,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
18898,L103968,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here."
18899,L103967,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
18900,L103966,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
18901,L103965,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
18902,L103964,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
18903,L103963,u599,m38,ANTHONY,So do I.
18904,L103962,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
18905,L103863,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
18906,L103862,u599,m38,ANTHONY,You mean a safecracker?
18907,L103857,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
18908,L103856,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
18909,L103853,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
18910,L103852,u599,m38,ANTHONY,You mean like techniques?
18911,L103849,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Grammar.
18912,L103848,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar."
18913,L103842,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Thanks.
18914,L103841,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent."
18915,L103840,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this."
18916,L103839,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
18917,L103838,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Thanks.
18918,L103837,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,That's a sharp jacket.
18919,L103836,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Nice to meet you.
18920,L103835,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"This is my business manager, Rowboat."
18921,L104225,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Temporarily.
18922,L104224,u601,m38,BOB,It's in the driveway.
18923,L104215,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account."
18924,L104214,u601,m38,BOB,We think Mr. Henry maybe --
18925,L104166,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Who's got the car keys?
18926,L104165,u601,m38,BOB,Yeah.
18927,L104134,u601,m38,BOB,I didn't do anything.
18928,L104133,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Jesus, Bob."
18929,L104106,u601,m38,BOB,No.
18930,L104105,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
18931,L104104,u601,m38,BOB,My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
18932,L104103,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What are you doing?
18933,L104068,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Sure.
18934,L104067,u601,m38,BOB,"No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?"
18935,L104065,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Nothing. I was just asking.
18936,L104064,u601,m38,BOB,"No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?"
18937,L104063,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"You OK, Bob?"
18938,L104025,u601,m38,BOB,Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
18939,L104024,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Give him a second.
18940,L103885,u601,m38,BOB,Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
18941,L103884,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Yeah. Let's keep it --
18942,L103879,u601,m38,BOB,It was stupid.
18943,L103878,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Let's not even talk about it.
18944,L103760,u601,m38,BOB,Jesus Christ! No.
18945,L103759,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Was Future Man adopted?
18946,L103758,u601,m38,BOB,No. I wasn't adopted.
18947,L103757,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Well, because you guys don't look alike."
18948,L103756,u601,m38,BOB,Why do you say that?
18949,L103755,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Were you adopted, Bob?"
18950,L103754,u601,m38,BOB,"Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell."
18951,L103753,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
18952,L103748,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
18953,L103747,u601,m38,BOB,Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
18954,L103746,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
18955,L103745,u601,m38,BOB,Sixty days?
18956,L103744,u599,m38,ANTHONY,At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
18957,L103739,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank."
18958,L103738,u601,m38,BOB,That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
18959,L103737,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
18960,L103736,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea."
18961,L103735,u601,m38,BOB,I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
18962,L103734,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"No, I don't mind."
18963,L103733,u601,m38,BOB,You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
18964,L103732,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Yes. You just got to stick with it.
18965,L103731,u601,m38,BOB,You think I'm improving?
18966,L103730,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game."
18967,L103729,u601,m38,BOB,Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
18968,L103728,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Why not?
18969,L103727,u601,m38,BOB,I'm not playing any more golf.
18970,L103726,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Bob, where you going?"
18971,L103591,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Is that OK?
18972,L103590,u601,m38,BOB,What?
18973,L103585,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?"
18974,L103584,u601,m38,BOB,"Anthony, I --"
18975,L103581,u601,m38,BOB,I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
18976,L103580,u599,m38,ANTHONY,How long are they going to hold him?
18977,L103468,u599,m38,ANTHONY,He looked too shaken-up.
18978,L103467,u601,m38,BOB,You think he got my license plates?
18979,L103429,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"OK, Dad."
18980,L103428,u601,m38,BOB,Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
18981,L103409,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Nobody does.
18982,L103408,u601,m38,BOB,I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
18983,L103407,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
18984,L103394,u601,m38,BOB,Move.
18985,L103393,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Where you going?
18986,L103387,u601,m38,BOB,Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
18987,L103386,u599,m38,ANTHONY,I hope not.
18988,L103385,u601,m38,BOB,"Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy."
18989,L103384,u599,m38,ANTHONY,There's a million places to hide around here.
18990,L103383,u601,m38,BOB,What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
18991,L103351,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What was that?
18992,L103350,u601,m38,BOB,You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
18993,L103334,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"See you, Bob."
18994,L103333,u601,m38,BOB,See you.
18995,L103325,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Yeah. He said that.
18996,L103324,u601,m38,BOB,Are you serious?
18997,L103193,u601,m38,BOB,Let them fight.
18998,L103192,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Let them fight.
18999,L103174,u599,m38,ANTHONY,You could make your own cinnamon toast.
19000,L103173,u601,m38,BOB,"I don't know. Sure, I guess."
19001,L103172,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Could you grow cinnamon?
19002,L103166,u601,m38,BOB,But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
19003,L103165,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Hector woudn't do anything.
19004,L103164,u601,m38,BOB,It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
19005,L103163,u599,m38,ANTHONY,In your backyard? How do you protect them?
19006,L103158,u601,m38,BOB,Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
19007,L103157,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
19008,L103119,u601,m38,BOB,Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
19009,L103118,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Did you ever steal a car before?
19010,L103109,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
19011,L103108,u601,m38,BOB,Who?
19012,L103107,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Future Man.
19013,L103599,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does."
19014,L103598,u606,m38,INEZ,Like silk?
19015,L103597,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What?  What?
19016,L103596,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"God, yes. Like silk."
19017,L103595,u606,m38,INEZ,"Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?"
19018,L103497,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?"
19019,L103496,u606,m38,INEZ,Cuba.
19020,L103495,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Were you born in Mexico?
19021,L103493,u599,m38,ANTHONY,It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
19022,L103492,u606,m38,INEZ,No.
19023,L103491,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
19024,L103490,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
19025,L103489,u606,m38,INEZ,Dies y nueve.
19026,L103488,u599,m38,ANTHONY,How do you say nineteen?
19027,L104123,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,Where were you?
19028,L104122,u599,m38,ANTHONY,The front stairs.
19029,L104121,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,Where'd they come from?
19030,L103821,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,Feel this.
19031,L103820,u599,m38,ANTHONY,What do you mean?
19032,L103819,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
19033,L103815,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Abdul-Shabazz?
19034,L103814,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,"Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz."
19035,L103809,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Uh-uh.
19036,L103808,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,"S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?"
19037,L103807,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Uh-uh.
19038,L103806,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
19039,L103794,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,I hear you're a good thief.
19040,L103793,u599,m38,ANTHONY,Yeah.
19041,L103792,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,You're Anthony?
19042,L103791,u599,m38,ANTHONY,"Nice to meet you, Applejack."
19043,L104115,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Bob! Get back in position!
19044,L104114,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,What?
19045,L103995,u603,m38,DIGNAN,True.
19046,L103994,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,You don't celebrate til it's over.
19047,L103993,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Well, this isn't really a party per se."
19048,L103992,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
19049,L103811,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,"Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac."
19050,L103810,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?"
19051,L103778,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
19052,L103777,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Wait. Did he see us?
19053,L103774,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
19054,L103773,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,What's he doing here?
19055,L103772,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Yeah.
19056,L103771,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,That's your friend Anthony?
19057,L103770,u603,m38,DIGNAN,That's Anthony.
19058,L103769,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Wait a second.
19059,L103768,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,Is that him?
19060,L103766,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,Is that Buckethead?
19061,L103765,u603,m38,DIGNAN,We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
19062,L103764,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
19063,L103763,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
19064,L103762,u600,m38,APPLEJACK,Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
19065,L103761,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand."
19066,L103182,u601,m38,BOB,The one and only Little Richard.
19067,L103181,u609,m38,LITTLE RICHARD,It seemed like a good idea at the time.
19068,L103180,u601,m38,BOB,"Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets."
19069,L103179,u609,m38,LITTLE RICHARD,I don't know about that.
19070,L103178,u601,m38,BOB,"Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts."
19071,L103176,u609,m38,LITTLE RICHARD,You're the faggot.
19072,L103175,u601,m38,BOB,Are you a fag?
19073,L104260,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Now!
19074,L104259,u601,m38,BOB,Wait a second --
19075,L104258,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Here we go.
19076,L104257,u601,m38,BOB,Hold on --
19077,L104239,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I don't really want to talk about it, Bob."
19078,L104238,u601,m38,BOB,Do they let you --
19079,L104235,u603,m38,DIGNAN,No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
19080,L104234,u601,m38,BOB,Do you have your own cell?
19081,L104233,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells."
19082,L104232,u601,m38,BOB,Do you have your own room?
19083,L104194,u603,m38,DIGNAN,That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
19084,L104193,u601,m38,BOB,What's that?
19085,L104192,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease."
19086,L104168,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Run. Run. Let's go.
19087,L104167,u601,m38,BOB,Applejack drove.
19088,L104162,u601,m38,BOB,He's stuck between two floors.
19089,L104161,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Where's Applejack?
19090,L104160,u601,m38,BOB,The elevator broke.
19091,L104145,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Take him to the car, Bob."
19092,L104144,u601,m38,BOB,I didn't think there was an alarm.
19093,L104143,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
19094,L104142,u601,m38,BOB,I think so.
19095,L104141,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Is he breathing?
19096,L104138,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Let's go!
19097,L104137,u601,m38,BOB,He's having a heart attack or something.
19098,L104136,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What's wrong with Applejack?
19099,L104110,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
19100,L104109,u601,m38,BOB,I couldn't hear anything.
19101,L104083,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Stand by. Bird Dog?
19102,L104082,u601,m38,BOB,It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
19103,L104081,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
19104,L104080,u601,m38,BOB,Everything OK?
19105,L104079,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Yeah?
19106,L104078,u601,m38,BOB,Scarecrow?
19107,L104023,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Jesus Christ.
19108,L104022,u601,m38,BOB,"I know it, man. Hang on."
19109,L104021,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Come on, Bob."
19110,L103917,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Look. We want you on the job.
19111,L103916,u601,m38,BOB,That's OK.
19112,L103911,u601,m38,BOB,That's OK.
19113,L103910,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I'm sorry, Bob."
19114,L103909,u601,m38,BOB,I didn't have any choice.
19115,L103908,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother."
19116,L103901,u601,m38,BOB,"I don't want to fight you, Dignan."
19117,L103900,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Come on!
19118,L103890,u603,m38,DIGNAN,All right! Backyard! Right now!
19119,L103889,u601,m38,BOB,Bullshit.
19120,L103888,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Bob, you're lying!"
19121,L103887,u601,m38,BOB,I never agreed to that.
19122,L103886,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You said 48 hours!
19123,L103883,u601,m38,BOB,"Man, I don't want to go into this."
19124,L103882,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?"
19125,L103881,u601,m38,BOB,I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
19126,L103880,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Right. It was extremely stupid.
19127,L103877,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Yeah. It is.
19128,L103876,u601,m38,BOB,It's too bad about what happened on the road.
19129,L103875,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Not a whole lot, Bob."
19130,L103874,u601,m38,BOB,Come on in. What you been up to?
19131,L103873,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Not bad.
19132,L103872,u601,m38,BOB,"Hey, Dignan. How's it going?"
19133,L103579,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Anthony. Bad news.
19134,L103578,u601,m38,BOB,Dignan.
19135,L103557,u601,m38,BOB,Let's go.
19136,L103556,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"You've got a beautiful walk, Bob."
19137,L103553,u603,m38,DIGNAN,That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
19138,L103552,u601,m38,BOB,"It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan."
19139,L103551,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid."
19140,L103550,u601,m38,BOB,What's his name?
19141,L103549,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Just get in the car, Bob."
19142,L103548,u601,m38,BOB,What is it?
19143,L103547,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Yes, I do."
19144,L103546,u601,m38,BOB,You don't even know his name.
19145,L103545,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I know it's not.
19146,L103544,u601,m38,BOB,"His name's not Future Man, Dignan."
19147,L103543,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that."
19148,L103540,u601,m38,BOB,"Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --"
19149,L103539,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Don't threaten me, Bob."
19150,L103538,u601,m38,BOB,Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
19151,L103537,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I can't do that, Bob."
19152,L103536,u601,m38,BOB,"Give me the keys, Dignan."
19153,L103535,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Good luck, since I got the keys."
19154,L103534,u601,m38,BOB,Watch me.
19155,L103533,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Not in that car you're not.
19156,L103532,u601,m38,BOB,I'm going back.
19157,L103531,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Don't ""Come on, Dignan"" me."
19158,L103530,u601,m38,BOB,"Come on, Dignan."
19159,L103529,u603,m38,DIGNAN,This could be a trap.
19160,L103528,u601,m38,BOB,"Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there."
19161,L103527,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Bob, that makes no sense."
19162,L103526,u601,m38,BOB,"Well, obviously, we got to go back."
19163,L103525,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What do you mean get back?
19164,L103524,u601,m38,BOB,We'll have to see when we get back.
19165,L103523,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
19166,L103522,u601,m38,BOB,I don't know.
19167,L103521,u603,m38,DIGNAN,How long has he been in there?
19168,L103520,u601,m38,BOB,I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
19169,L103519,u603,m38,DIGNAN,So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
19170,L103518,u601,m38,BOB,The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
19171,L103517,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
19172,L103516,u601,m38,BOB,They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
19173,L103515,u603,m38,DIGNAN,That could be anybody's.
19174,L103514,u601,m38,BOB,"Well, the marijuana crop is a good start."
19175,L103513,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?"
19176,L103511,u601,m38,BOB,They said he's a drug dealer.
19177,L103510,u603,m38,DIGNAN,But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
19178,L103509,u601,m38,BOB,The weed.
19179,L103508,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What are you talking about?
19180,L103507,u601,m38,BOB,My brother's in jail.
19181,L103506,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"You can go first, Bob."
19182,L103480,u601,m38,BOB,See you in a little while.
19183,L103479,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Bob. Are you coming?
19184,L103472,u601,m38,BOB,You're the one who kept saying ram him.
19185,L103471,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What the fuck possessed you?
19186,L103470,u601,m38,BOB,It's registered in my mother's name.
19187,L103469,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
19188,L103465,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I don't know.
19189,L103464,u601,m38,BOB,Is he chasing us?
19190,L103463,u601,m38,BOB,He wouldn't move.
19191,L103462,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?"
19192,L103406,u601,m38,BOB,There were more than that.
19193,L103405,u603,m38,DIGNAN,In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
19194,L103403,u603,m38,DIGNAN,So it's my fault?
19195,L103402,u601,m38,BOB,I told you they were there.
19196,L103401,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Way to go, Bob!"
19197,L103349,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Bob, I've got nightmares."
19198,L103348,u601,m38,BOB,That's true. That would give me nightmares.
19199,L103347,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, ""I'm going to remember you!"""
19200,L103345,u601,m38,BOB,I don't want to talk about it.
19201,L103344,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Bob, will you please listen?"
19202,L103332,u603,m38,DIGNAN,No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
19203,L103331,u601,m38,BOB,You really think he'll remember you?
19204,L103321,u603,m38,DIGNAN,No. I was calm.
19205,L103320,u601,m38,BOB,"Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!"
19206,L103319,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Don't count it.
19207,L103318,u601,m38,BOB,How much is there?
19208,L103315,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light."
19209,L103314,u601,m38,BOB,Did we get it?
19210,L103313,u603,m38,DIGNAN,That's good. Keep it at forty.
19211,L103312,u601,m38,BOB,This is natural.
19212,L103311,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural."
19213,L103310,u601,m38,BOB,What happened?
19214,L103274,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
19215,L103273,u601,m38,BOB,What are you doing?
19216,L103272,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did."
19217,L103271,u601,m38,BOB,That's too bad.
19218,L103270,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
19219,L103269,u601,m38,BOB,His name was Swifty?
19220,L103268,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated."
19221,L103267,u601,m38,BOB,He electrocuted someone?
19222,L103266,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year."
19223,L103264,u601,m38,BOB,"Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?"
19224,L103263,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing."
19225,L103262,u601,m38,BOB,He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
19226,L103243,u603,m38,DIGNAN,God DAMMIT.
19227,L103242,u601,m38,BOB,I paid for it.
19228,L103239,u601,m38,BOB,I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
19229,L103238,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
19230,L103237,u601,m38,BOB,I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
19231,L103236,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Bob.
19232,L103232,u601,m38,BOB,OK.
19233,L103231,u603,m38,DIGNAN,That's your domain.
19234,L103230,u601,m38,BOB,That's my responsibility.
19235,L103229,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway."
19236,L103228,u601,m38,BOB,I'm going to take a look at this.
19237,L103220,u601,m38,BOB,Let's just go.
19238,L103219,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I think we might of scared her.
19239,L103216,u601,m38,BOB,Maybe she turned.
19240,L103215,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Where'd she go?
19241,L103212,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her."
19242,L103211,u601,m38,BOB,"Well, don't blame me. I told you."
19243,L103210,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
19244,L103209,u601,m38,BOB,"No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic."
19245,L103208,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild."
19246,L103207,u601,m38,BOB,"I warned you, Dignan."
19247,L103206,u603,m38,DIGNAN,The guy is fucking insane.
19248,L103188,u601,m38,BOB,I told you he's crazy.
19249,L103187,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What did I say?
19250,L103186,u601,m38,BOB,I can't believe you said that.
19251,L103185,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What was that all about?
19252,L103171,u601,m38,BOB,"Yeah, but don't tell anybody."
19253,L103170,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"You're paranoid, Bob."
19254,L103169,u601,m38,BOB,Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
19255,L103168,u601,m38,BOB,Good question.
19256,L103167,u603,m38,DIGNAN,If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
19257,L103162,u601,m38,BOB,You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
19258,L103161,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob."
19259,L103160,u601,m38,BOB,As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
19260,L103159,u603,m38,DIGNAN,How much could you grow? Realistically.
19261,L103125,u601,m38,BOB,I'll just drive my car.
19262,L103124,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
19263,L103123,u601,m38,BOB,"It's true, Dignan."
19264,L103122,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"OK, Bob."
19265,L103121,u601,m38,BOB,Yes. I did.
19266,L103120,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You stole a Trans-Am.
19267,L103117,u601,m38,BOB,Can you use a coaster.
19268,L103116,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"What are you talking about, Bob?"
19269,L103115,u601,m38,BOB,"If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one."
19270,L103112,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Let's cut the bullshit.
19271,L103111,u601,m38,BOB,That never would of --
19272,L103110,u603,m38,DIGNAN,He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
19273,L103106,u601,m38,BOB,My brother.
19274,L103105,u603,m38,DIGNAN,So who's going to know?
19275,L103104,u601,m38,BOB,They are.
19276,L103103,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I thought your parents were in Italy.
19277,L103102,u601,m38,BOB,No.
19278,L103101,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Not even for emergencies?
19279,L103100,u601,m38,BOB,I'm not allowed to drive those.
19280,L103099,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?"
19281,L103098,u601,m38,BOB,"Well, what do you think?"
19282,L103945,u605,m38,FUTURE MAN,Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
19283,L103944,u601,m38,BOB,I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
19284,L103943,u605,m38,FUTURE MAN,"I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission."
19285,L103942,u601,m38,BOB,"John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home."
19286,L103941,u605,m38,FUTURE MAN,I might have mentioned it.
19287,L103932,u601,m38,BOB,"Yeah. Hey, Clay."
19288,L103931,u605,m38,FUTURE MAN,"Fancy seeing you here, Bob."
19289,L103752,u605,m38,FUTURE MAN,Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
19290,L103751,u601,m38,BOB,I'm working on it.
19291,L103750,u605,m38,FUTURE MAN,How's that 700 bucks coming?
19292,L103929,u601,m38,BOB,No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
19293,L103928,u607,m38,JACKSON,He said you ran away from home.
19294,L103927,u601,m38,BOB,He said what?
19295,L103926,u607,m38,JACKSON,Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
19296,L103925,u607,m38,JACKSON,This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
19297,L103924,u601,m38,BOB,I'm trying.
19298,L103923,u607,m38,JACKSON,You keeping out of trouble?
19299,L103922,u601,m38,BOB,"Hey, Jackson. How's it going?"
19300,L103921,u607,m38,JACKSON,"How you doing, Bob?"
19301,L103380,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Did you hear that?
19302,L103379,u602,m38,COP,Ground defense.
19303,L103378,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Hand to hand combat?
19304,L103377,u602,m38,COP,Social issues. Crime prevention.
19305,L103376,u603,m38,DIGNAN,And what does that cover?
19306,L103375,u602,m38,COP,26 weeks.
19307,L103374,u603,m38,DIGNAN,How long do you have to go?
19308,L104034,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this."
19309,L104033,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Well, I think --"
19310,L104032,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Why?
19311,L104031,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Yes.
19312,L104030,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
19313,L104028,u603,m38,DIGNAN,We're just going over a few things.
19314,L104027,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"Join the party, fellas."
19315,L103865,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,He's damn good.
19316,L103864,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Is he good?
19317,L103861,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
19318,L103860,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Oh, yeah."
19319,L103859,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys."
19320,L103858,u603,m38,DIGNAN,The grammar?
19321,L103851,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
19322,L103850,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What do you mean grammar?
19323,L103845,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?"
19324,L103844,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Is he in?
19325,L103832,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,This is no good.
19326,L103831,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry."
19327,L103830,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
19328,L104127,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What can we do?
19329,L104126,u608,m38,KUMAR,Can't get it. It won't...
19330,L104125,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What's the story?
19331,L104091,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it."
19332,L104090,u608,m38,KUMAR,Why did he go that way?
19333,L104089,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Who? Applejack?
19334,L104088,u608,m38,KUMAR,Where did he go?
19335,L103294,u603,m38,DIGNAN,You got that?
19336,L103293,u604,m38,EMPLOYEE,I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
19337,L103292,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Where is he? Where is Rob?
19338,L103286,u603,m38,DIGNAN,In the cash register. Step away from the door.
19339,L103285,u604,m38,EMPLOYEE,Where?
19340,L103284,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"Well, I left some money in there."
19341,L103283,u604,m38,EMPLOYEE,He left his sweater.
19342,L103282,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Where's that guy going?
19343,L103281,u604,m38,EMPLOYEE,"We're closed, sir."
19344,L103829,u610,m38,MAN,"No, it's not."
19345,L103828,u603,m38,DIGNAN,It's locked.
19346,L103827,u610,m38,MAN,Come on in!
19347,L103826,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Mr. Henry?
19348,L103825,u610,m38,MAN,How's the weather down there?
19349,L103665,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Right.
19350,L103664,u610,m38,MAN,No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
19351,L103663,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Fuck you. You a Hoto.
19352,L103662,u610,m38,MAN,You Hoto?
19353,L103661,u603,m38,DIGNAN,No. Just pool.
19354,L103660,u610,m38,MAN,Fight. You know.
19355,L103659,u603,m38,DIGNAN,What?
19356,L103658,u610,m38,MAN,Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
19357,L103657,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Guess I'll get another Tecate.
19358,L103656,u610,m38,MAN,She is a good looking woman.
19359,L103655,u603,m38,DIGNAN,I don't know.
19360,L103654,u610,m38,MAN,Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
19361,L103653,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Got a little lucky.
19362,L103652,u610,m38,MAN,You a good pool player.
19363,L103650,u603,m38,DIGNAN,Sure.
19364,L103649,u610,m38,MAN,You like Chicanos?
19365,L103648,u610,m38,MAN,"She Chicano, yes?"
19366,L103647,u603,m38,DIGNAN,"No, my friend knows her."
19367,L103646,u610,m38,MAN,Is that your chiquita?
19368,L103645,u603,m38,DIGNAN,No. I just have short hair.
19369,L103644,u610,m38,MAN,"Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?"
19370,L103951,u605,m38,FUTURE MAN,Nice to meet you.
19371,L103950,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"Pleasure to meet you, John."
19372,L103949,u605,m38,FUTURE MAN,"Well, we'll see you later, Bob."
19373,L103948,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
19374,L103947,u605,m38,FUTURE MAN,What?
19375,L103946,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"The world needs dreamers, son."
19376,L103939,u611,m38,MR. HENRY,"Good to know you, John."
19377,L103938,u605,m38,FUTURE MAN,John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
19378,L108448,u615,m39,GRETKOV,Bourne comes here? Why?
19379,L108447,u612,m39,ABBOTT,He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
19380,L108446,u615,m39,GRETKOV,What?
19381,L108445,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Save it for Bourne.
19382,L108444,u615,m39,GRETKOV,Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
19383,L108443,u612,m39,ABBOTT,What do you mean?
19384,L108442,u615,m39,GRETKOV,"Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it."
19385,L108381,u615,m39,GRETKOV,One last push. One.
19386,L108380,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push."
19387,L108378,u615,m39,GRETKOV,Anything else?
19388,L108377,u612,m39,ABBOTT,She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
19389,L108376,u615,m39,GRETKOV,And the Landy woman?
19390,L108375,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse."
19391,L108374,u615,m39,GRETKOV,Will it track back to us?
19392,L108373,u612,m39,ABBOTT,I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
19393,L108372,u615,m39,GRETKOV,There was a mistake.
19394,L108371,u612,m39,ABBOTT,You told me Bourne was dead.
19395,L108465,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is."
19396,L108464,u623,m39,PAMELA,No. You lost your way.
19397,L108463,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are."
19398,L108462,u623,m39,PAMELA,No good options left?
19399,L108461,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Had to be done.
19400,L108460,u623,m39,PAMELA,"And Danny Zorn, what was that?"
19401,L108459,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Why not? It was just money.
19402,L108458,u623,m39,PAMELA,And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
19403,L108457,u612,m39,ABBOTT,I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
19404,L108456,u623,m39,PAMELA,'Why' would be enough for me.
19405,L108455,u612,m39,ABBOTT,I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
19406,L108454,u623,m39,PAMELA,I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
19407,L108453,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Sit down.
19408,L108435,u623,m39,PAMELA,"I'm sorry, Ward."
19409,L108434,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them..."
19410,L108433,u623,m39,PAMELA,Don't know.
19411,L108432,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
19412,L108429,u612,m39,ABBOTT,No... It must have been Bourne.
19413,L108428,u623,m39,PAMELA,Did he say anything to you?
19414,L108427,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"Oh, God... It must have been Bourne."
19415,L108426,u623,m39,PAMELA,They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
19416,L108425,u612,m39,ABBOTT,What?
19417,L108415,u612,m39,ABBOTT,I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
19418,L108414,u623,m39,PAMELA,Sorry to wake you.
19419,L108317,u623,m39,PAMELA,"Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies."
19420,L108316,u612,m39,ABBOTT,It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
19421,L108315,u623,m39,PAMELA,So what's he doing? You believe him?
19422,L108253,u612,m39,ABBOTT,There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
19423,L108252,u623,m39,PAMELA,Don't you want answers?
19424,L108251,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him."
19425,L108250,u623,m39,PAMELA,Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
19426,L108249,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?"
19427,L108099,u623,m39,PAMELA,"And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him..."
19428,L108098,u612,m39,ABBOTT,You don't know what you're getting into here.
19429,L108097,u623,m39,PAMELA,I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
19430,L108096,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Berlin!
19431,L108062,u612,m39,ABBOTT,So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
19432,L108061,u623,m39,PAMELA,"What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!"
19433,L108060,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?"
19434,L108059,u623,m39,PAMELA,May I finish?
19435,L108058,u612,m39,ABBOTT,We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
19436,L108057,u623,m39,PAMELA,Excuse me.
19437,L108056,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Do you know what his budget was?
19438,L108055,u623,m39,PAMELA,"...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars."
19439,L108054,u623,m39,PAMELA,...this is Conklin's computer.
19440,L108053,u623,m39,PAMELA,"...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This..."
19441,L108044,u623,m39,PAMELA,"I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne."
19442,L108043,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
19443,L108042,u623,m39,PAMELA,And Bourne? Where's he now?
19444,L108041,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done."
19445,L108040,u623,m39,PAMELA,"So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap..."
19446,L108039,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left."
19447,L108038,u623,m39,PAMELA,I want to know what happened.
19448,L108037,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?"
19449,L108036,u623,m39,PAMELA,Let's talk about Conklin.
19450,L108035,u623,m39,PAMELA,"He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward."
19451,L108034,u612,m39,ABBOTT,To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
19452,L108033,u623,m39,PAMELA,I want to know about Treadstone.
19453,L108032,u612,m39,ABBOTT,And what are we looking for?
19454,L108030,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade."
19455,L108029,u623,m39,PAMELA,That's not gonna fly.
19456,L108028,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Never heard of it.
19457,L108027,u623,m39,PAMELA,Treadstone.
19458,L108339,u627,m39,ZORN,Okay...
19459,L108338,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Show me again...
19460,L108337,u627,m39,ZORN,"Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?"
19461,L108336,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Who else knows about this?
19462,L108335,u627,m39,ZORN,Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
19463,L108334,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Lots of people...
19464,L108333,u627,m39,ZORN,Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
19465,L108332,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Keep going...
19466,L108331,u627,m39,ZORN,Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
19467,L108330,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Jesus...
19468,L108329,u627,m39,ZORN,"Is it a slam dunk? No, but..."
19469,L108328,u612,m39,ABBOTT,It was staged?
19470,L108327,u627,m39,ZORN,"There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know."
19471,L108326,u612,m39,ABBOTT,And?
19472,L108325,u627,m39,ZORN,"You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it."
19473,L108324,u612,m39,ABBOTT,"What do you have, Danny?"
19474,L108323,u627,m39,ZORN,"I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there."
19475,L108322,u627,m39,ZORN,The sooner the better.
19476,L108321,u612,m39,ABBOTT,She say what time I should call?
19477,L108319,u612,m39,ABBOTT,Thanks.
19478,L108318,u627,m39,ZORN,Sir...
19479,L108515,u613,m39,BOURNE,I'm sorry.
19480,L108514,u616,m39,IRENA,Is this really happening?
19481,L108513,u613,m39,BOURNE,I have to go now.
19482,L108512,u613,m39,BOURNE,No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
19483,L108511,u616,m39,IRENA,Because you're afraid!
19484,L108510,u613,m39,BOURNE,I can't let you do that either.
19485,L108509,u616,m39,IRENA,I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
19486,L108508,u613,m39,BOURNE,Look at me.
19487,L108507,u616,m39,IRENA,YOU'RE A LIAR!
19488,L108506,u613,m39,BOURNE,You know I'm not.
19489,L108505,u616,m39,IRENA,You're a liar.
19490,L108504,u613,m39,BOURNE,It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
19491,L108502,u613,m39,BOURNE,I don't want you to forgive me.
19492,L108501,u616,m39,IRENA,How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
19493,L108500,u613,m39,BOURNE,They loved you.  And I killed them.
19494,L108499,u616,m39,IRENA,You killed them.
19495,L108498,u613,m39,BOURNE,"It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that."
19496,L108497,u613,m39,BOURNE,I killed them.
19497,L108496,u616,m39,IRENA,Then what?
19498,L108495,u613,m39,BOURNE,That's not what happened to your parents.
19499,L108494,u616,m39,IRENA,Yes...
19500,L108493,u613,m39,BOURNE,It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
19501,L108491,u616,m39,IRENA,What?
19502,L108490,u613,m39,BOURNE,I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
19503,L108489,u616,m39,IRENA,"No, I do."
19504,L108488,u613,m39,BOURNE,No. It's because you don't know how they died.
19505,L108487,u616,m39,IRENA,It's nothing. It's just a picture.
19506,L108486,u613,m39,BOURNE,It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
19507,L108485,u616,m39,IRENA,Okay.
19508,L108484,u613,m39,BOURNE,"Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here."
19509,L108482,u616,m39,IRENA,I speak English.
19510,L108481,u613,m39,BOURNE,Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
19511,L108193,u618,m39,JARDA,-- take the back -- get another car --
19512,L108192,u613,m39,BOURNE,-- what? --
19513,L108191,u618,m39,JARDA,-- my coat -- but we should --
19514,L108190,u613,m39,BOURNE,-- car keys?
19515,L108184,u613,m39,BOURNE,How long? How long do I have --
19516,L108183,u618,m39,JARDA,I'm sorry.
19517,L108182,u613,m39,BOURNE,You called it in?
19518,L108179,u613,m39,BOURNE,I did.
19519,L108178,u618,m39,JARDA,"She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are..."
19520,L108176,u618,m39,JARDA,I don't know! Why would I lie?
19521,L108175,u613,m39,BOURNE,What's going on in Berlin?
19522,L108174,u618,m39,JARDA,I don't know who that is.
19523,L108173,u613,m39,BOURNE,Pamela Landy?
19524,L108172,u618,m39,JARDA,A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
19525,L108171,u613,m39,BOURNE,Who sent you to Greece?
19526,L108170,u618,m39,JARDA,I don't know.
19527,L108169,u613,m39,BOURNE,"You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?"
19528,L108166,u618,m39,JARDA,Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
19529,L108165,u613,m39,BOURNE,Try again.
19530,L108164,u618,m39,JARDA,He's dead.
19531,L108163,u613,m39,BOURNE,Conklin.
19532,L108162,u618,m39,JARDA,What do you want?
19533,L108161,u613,m39,BOURNE,She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
19534,L108160,u618,m39,JARDA,So why didn't you kill me then?
19535,L108158,u618,m39,JARDA,I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
19536,L108157,u613,m39,BOURNE,You still should've moved.
19537,L108155,u618,m39,JARDA,Sorry. Old habits.
19538,L108154,u613,m39,BOURNE,Front. Use your teeth.
19539,L108152,u613,m39,BOURNE,Drop it.
19540,L108151,u618,m39,JARDA,Felt a little light.
19541,L108150,u613,m39,BOURNE,I emptied it.
19542,L108413,u619,m39,MARIE,Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
19543,L108412,u613,m39,BOURNE,"God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you."
19544,L108411,u613,m39,BOURNE,I only dream about people who are dead.
19545,L108410,u619,m39,MARIE,You do?
19546,L108409,u613,m39,BOURNE,I know it's a dream.
19547,L108408,u613,m39,BOURNE,It might have.
19548,L108407,u619,m39,MARIE,It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
19549,L108406,u613,m39,BOURNE,I did.
19550,L108405,u619,m39,MARIE,But you found another choice.
19551,L108404,u613,m39,BOURNE,I wanted to kill him.
19552,L107970,u613,m39,BOURNE,Tell me later.
19553,L107969,u619,m39,MARIE,"I love you, too."
19554,L107967,u613,m39,BOURNE,There's no choice.
19555,L107966,u619,m39,MARIE,"Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this."
19556,L107965,u613,m39,BOURNE,"I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone."
19557,L107964,u619,m39,MARIE,There must be another way!
19558,L107963,u613,m39,BOURNE,"If he crosses the bridge, it is."
19559,L107962,u619,m39,MARIE,What if it's not who you think it is?
19560,L107961,u613,m39,BOURNE,I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
19561,L107960,u619,m39,MARIE,Where are you going?
19562,L107959,u613,m39,BOURNE,You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
19563,L107958,u619,m39,MARIE,-- hang on --
19564,L107957,u613,m39,BOURNE,-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
19565,L107956,u619,m39,MARIE,-- it's just him? --
19566,L107955,u613,m39,BOURNE,-- not yet --
19567,L107954,u619,m39,MARIE,Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
19568,L107953,u613,m39,BOURNE,-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
19569,L107952,u619,m39,MARIE,-- where? -
19570,L107951,u613,m39,BOURNE,Switch! You drive!
19571,L107950,u619,m39,MARIE,What?
19572,L107949,u613,m39,BOURNE,You drive.
19573,L107948,u613,m39,BOURNE,-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
19574,L107947,u619,m39,MARIE,-- where's left to go? --
19575,L107946,u613,m39,BOURNE,"Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --"
19576,L107945,u619,m39,MARIE,I don't want to move again... I like it here.
19577,L107944,u613,m39,BOURNE,We can't wait to be sure.
19578,L107943,u619,m39,MARIE,...but you're not -- you're not sure...
19579,L107942,u613,m39,BOURNE,Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
19580,L107941,u619,m39,MARIE,Where --
19581,L107940,u613,m39,BOURNE,No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...
19582,L107939,u619,m39,MARIE,That's crazy.
19583,L107938,u613,m39,BOURNE,It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
19584,L107937,u619,m39,MARIE,So...
19585,L107936,u613,m39,BOURNE,He was at the campground yesterday.
19586,L107935,u619,m39,MARIE,But you're sure?
19587,L107934,u613,m39,BOURNE,We pushed it. We got lazy.
19588,L107933,u619,m39,MARIE,But we were so careful.
19589,L107932,u613,m39,BOURNE,The Telegraph office.
19590,L107931,u619,m39,MARIE,No... How?
19591,L107926,u619,m39,MARIE,One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
19592,L107925,u613,m39,BOURNE,But it ends up the same.
19593,L107924,u619,m39,MARIE,You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
19594,L107923,u613,m39,BOURNE,I should be better by now.
19595,L107922,u619,m39,MARIE,Sleep. Sleep now.
19596,L107921,u619,m39,MARIE,I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
19597,L107920,u613,m39,BOURNE,It's just a nightmare.
19598,L107919,u619,m39,MARIE,I worry when you get like this.
19599,L107918,u613,m39,BOURNE,"I'm trying, Marie, Okay?"
19600,L107917,u613,m39,BOURNE,I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
19601,L107916,u619,m39,MARIE,We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
19602,L107915,u613,m39,BOURNE,-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
19603,L107914,u619,m39,MARIE,-- it hasn't been two years --
19604,L107913,u613,m39,BOURNE,Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
19605,L107912,u619,m39,MARIE,You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
19606,L107911,u613,m39,BOURNE,No. There's nothing new.
19607,L107910,u619,m39,MARIE,I'll get the book.
19608,L107909,u613,m39,BOURNE,Conklin up front.
19609,L107908,u619,m39,MARIE,"Where were you, Jason? In the car."
19610,L108312,u622,m39,NICKY,...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
19611,L108311,u613,m39,BOURNE,I was here!
19612,L108310,u622,m39,NICKY,No... Jason... please...
19613,L108309,u622,m39,NICKY,You never worked Berlin...
19614,L108308,u613,m39,BOURNE,That's a lie!
19615,L108307,u622,m39,NICKY,Your first assignment was Geneva.
19616,L108306,u613,m39,BOURNE,My first job.
19617,L108305,u622,m39,NICKY,No. You never worked Berlin.
19618,L108304,u613,m39,BOURNE,For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
19619,L108303,u622,m39,NICKY,What do you mean?
19620,L108302,u613,m39,BOURNE,So when was I here?
19621,L108301,u622,m39,NICKY,He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
19622,L108300,u613,m39,BOURNE,Abbott?
19623,L108299,u622,m39,NICKY,Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
19624,L108298,u613,m39,BOURNE,"Why are you here, then?"
19625,L108296,u622,m39,NICKY,Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
19626,L108295,u613,m39,BOURNE,What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
19627,L108293,u613,m39,BOURNE,I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
19628,L108292,u622,m39,NICKY,"You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!"
19629,L108291,u613,m39,BOURNE,I killed him???
19630,L108290,u622,m39,NICKY,And you got to him before we could.
19631,L108289,u613,m39,BOURNE,Last week? When?
19632,L108288,u622,m39,NICKY,It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
19633,L108287,u613,m39,BOURNE,A Russian?
19634,L108286,u622,m39,NICKY,Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
19635,L108285,u613,m39,BOURNE,Say it.
19636,L108284,u613,m39,BOURNE,I want to hear it from you.
19637,L108283,u622,m39,NICKY,"What is this, a game?"
19638,L108282,u613,m39,BOURNE,How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
19639,L108280,u622,m39,NICKY,"They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!"
19640,L108279,u613,m39,BOURNE,Why is she trying to kill me?
19641,L108275,u613,m39,BOURNE,IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
19642,L108274,u622,m39,NICKY,You hear me? I believed you.
19643,L108273,u613,m39,BOURNE,Who is Pamela Landy?
19644,L108272,u622,m39,NICKY,"I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you..."
19645,L108265,u613,m39,BOURNE,Get on it.
19646,L108264,u622,m39,NICKY,Yes.
19647,L108263,u613,m39,BOURNE,See that tram coming around the corner?
19648,L108531,u623,m39,PAMELA,Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
19649,L108530,u613,m39,BOURNE,You didn't answer my question.
19650,L108529,u623,m39,PAMELA,Sounds like a threat.
19651,L108528,u613,m39,BOURNE,Don't need it. I remember everything.
19652,L108526,u623,m39,PAMELA,Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
19653,L108525,u613,m39,BOURNE,What's that?
19654,L108524,u623,m39,PAMELA,Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
19655,L108522,u623,m39,PAMELA,Are you disappointed?
19656,L108521,u613,m39,BOURNE,Why am I alive?
19657,L108520,u623,m39,PAMELA,Careful...
19658,L108519,u613,m39,BOURNE,"Oh, shit..."
19659,L108518,u623,m39,PAMELA,"Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital."
19660,L108517,u613,m39,BOURNE,Where am I?
19661,L108246,u613,m39,BOURNE,Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
19662,L108245,u623,m39,PAMELA,"Okay, Jason, your move."
19663,L108242,u613,m39,BOURNE,There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
19664,L108241,u623,m39,PAMELA,Who?
19665,L108240,u613,m39,BOURNE,I want someone I know to take me in.
19666,L108239,u623,m39,PAMELA,"Okay, how do you want to do it?"
19667,L108238,u613,m39,BOURNE,I want to come in.
19668,L108237,u623,m39,PAMELA,What do you want?
19669,L108236,u623,m39,PAMELA,Bourne?
19670,L108235,u613,m39,BOURNE,It's me.
19671,L108441,u614,m39,CRONIN,Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
19672,L108440,u623,m39,PAMELA,What? The tapes?
19673,L108439,u614,m39,CRONIN,You're sure?
19674,L108431,u614,m39,CRONIN,But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
19675,L108430,u623,m39,PAMELA,We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
19676,L108370,u623,m39,PAMELA,This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
19677,L108369,u614,m39,CRONIN,What?
19678,L108368,u623,m39,PAMELA,Alright... take it down.
19679,L108357,u623,m39,PAMELA,I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
19680,L108356,u614,m39,CRONIN,Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
19681,L108348,u623,m39,PAMELA,-- the hotel -- how far? --
19682,L108347,u614,m39,CRONIN,-- go -- take the van! --
19683,L108102,u623,m39,PAMELA,-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
19684,L108101,u614,m39,CRONIN,-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
19685,L108072,u623,m39,PAMELA,"Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with."
19686,L108071,u614,m39,CRONIN,"There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --"
19687,L108070,u623,m39,PAMELA,Who's going? Us?
19688,L108069,u614,m39,CRONIN,Looks like he's been detained.
19689,L108012,u623,m39,PAMELA,And the Germans can't match it?
19690,L108011,u614,m39,CRONIN,-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
19691,L108010,u614,m39,CRONIN,I'm working on it.
19692,L108009,u623,m39,PAMELA,We need to get in there.
19693,L107999,u626,m39,VIC,-- shut up! -- just shut the --
19694,L107998,u617,m39,IVAN,-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
19695,L107997,u626,m39,VIC,-- who? -- who else is here? --
19696,L107995,u617,m39,IVAN,Is there. Is all there.
19697,L107994,u626,m39,VIC,This is everything? Is there.
19698,L107993,u617,m39,IVAN,Now. Show now.
19699,L107992,u626,m39,VIC,Here?
19700,L107991,u617,m39,IVAN,Show me.
19701,L108066,u623,m39,PAMELA,"I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?"
19702,L108065,u620,m39,MARSHALL,"Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?"
19703,L107985,u623,m39,PAMELA,"For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price."
19704,L107984,u620,m39,MARSHALL,Still...
19705,L107983,u623,m39,PAMELA,"We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop."
19706,L107982,u620,m39,MARSHALL,"It's a lot of money, Pam."
19707,L107981,u623,m39,PAMELA,That's where we came out.
19708,L107980,u620,m39,MARSHALL,I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
19709,L108095,u624,m39,PAMELA/PHONE,"I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is..."
19710,L108094,u621,m39,NEVINS/PHONE,"Yes, sir -- ma'am..."
19711,L108093,u624,m39,PAMELA/PHONE,"I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??"
19712,L108092,u624,m39,PAMELA/PHONE,"If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer..."
19713,L108091,u621,m39,NEVINS/PHONE,Me? Four years.
19714,L108090,u624,m39,PAMELA/PHONE,How long have you worked for the agency?
19715,L108086,u624,m39,PAMELA/PHONE,"Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?"
19716,L108085,u621,m39,NEVINS/PHONE,Who's this?
19717,L108084,u624,m39,PAMELA/PHONE,Mr. Nevins?
19718,L108535,u623,m39,PAMELA,Felt promising. It's a start.
19719,L108534,u622,m39,NICKY,So?
19720,L108533,u623,m39,PAMELA,Let's give him half an hour.
19721,L108256,u623,m39,PAMELA,Alright...
19722,L108255,u622,m39,NICKY,I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
19723,L108254,u623,m39,PAMELA,What do you think? Is he coming in?
19724,L108231,u622,m39,NICKY,It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
19725,L108230,u623,m39,PAMELA,Is it fresh?
19726,L108204,u622,m39,NICKY,Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
19727,L108203,u623,m39,PAMELA,And why is that?
19728,L108202,u622,m39,NICKY,I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
19729,L108136,u623,m39,PAMELA,"See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from."
19730,L108135,u622,m39,NICKY,What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
19731,L108134,u623,m39,PAMELA,Some women like Dobermans --
19732,L108133,u622,m39,NICKY,These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
19733,L108132,u623,m39,PAMELA,Did you?
19734,L108131,u622,m39,NICKY,"You mean, did I want a date?"
19735,L108130,u623,m39,PAMELA,You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
19736,L108129,u622,m39,NICKY,You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
19737,L108128,u623,m39,PAMELA,Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
19738,L108127,u622,m39,NICKY,If you say so.
19739,L108126,u623,m39,PAMELA,So he fooled you.
19740,L108125,u622,m39,NICKY,I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
19741,L108124,u623,m39,PAMELA,Believed what?
19742,L108123,u622,m39,NICKY,"Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him."
19743,L108122,u623,m39,PAMELA,Are you an expert in amnesia?
19744,L108121,u622,m39,NICKY,"Am I a doctor, no, but..."
19745,L108120,u623,m39,PAMELA,I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
19746,L108119,u623,m39,PAMELA,You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
19747,L108118,u622,m39,NICKY,Good luck.
19748,L108114,u622,m39,NICKY,Before this? Before Bourne? No.
19749,L108113,u623,m39,PAMELA,Amnesia?
19750,L108112,u622,m39,NICKY,Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
19751,L108111,u623,m39,PAMELA,What kind of problems?
19752,L108393,u623,m39,PAMELA,"And what about you, anything?"
19753,L108392,u625,m39,TEDDY,Yes. In that order.
19754,L108391,u623,m39,PAMELA,Are we hacking or asking?
19755,L108390,u625,m39,TEDDY,"We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed."
19756,L108387,u623,m39,PAMELA,"Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there..."
19757,L108386,u625,m39,TEDDY,His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
19758,L108385,u623,m39,PAMELA,By who?
19759,L108384,u625,m39,TEDDY,"Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered."
19760,L108355,u623,m39,PAMELA,"Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?"
19761,L108354,u625,m39,TEDDY,"Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but..."
19762,L108224,u623,m39,PAMELA,Are we locked up?
19763,L108223,u625,m39,TEDDY,No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
19764,L108222,u623,m39,PAMELA,Anything?
19765,L108018,u623,m39,PAMELA,"What the hell is a ""Treadstone?"""
19766,L108017,u625,m39,TEDDY,"Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone."
19767,L108016,u623,m39,PAMELA,Do we know what this says?
19768,L109843,u628,m40,ARGYLE,"They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it."
19769,L109842,u632,m40,LEADER,Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
19770,L109841,u628,m40,ARGYLE,"My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over."
19771,L109840,u632,m40,LEADER,What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
19772,L109839,u628,m40,ARGYLE,"We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?"
19773,L109838,u632,m40,LEADER,Someone dead from this household?
19774,L109855,u628,m40,ARGYLE,"Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes."
19775,L109854,u642,m40,WILLIAM,What are they doing?
19776,L109851,u628,m40,ARGYLE,"Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite."
19777,L109850,u642,m40,WILLIAM,"It was in Latin, sir."
19778,L109849,u628,m40,ARGYLE,Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
19779,L109848,u628,m40,ARGYLE,"Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened."
19780,L109847,u642,m40,WILLIAM,I don't want to leave.
19781,L109846,u628,m40,ARGYLE,"We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors."
19782,L110416,u629,m40,CRAIG,He has already agreed to come.
19783,L110415,u641,m40,WALLACE,"I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland."
19784,L110414,u629,m40,CRAIG,"We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one."
19785,L110413,u641,m40,WALLACE,So let the council swear publicly.
19786,L110412,u629,m40,CRAIG,An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
19787,L110411,u641,m40,WALLACE,You've all sworn to Longshanks.
19788,L110410,u629,m40,CRAIG,Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
19789,L110300,u629,m40,CRAIG,It is suicide.
19790,L110299,u641,m40,WALLACE,"With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!"
19791,L110298,u629,m40,CRAIG,We cannot defeat this --
19792,L110297,u641,m40,WALLACE,Peace?!
19793,L110296,u629,m40,CRAIG,We must sue for peace.
19794,L110295,u641,m40,WALLACE,A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
19795,L110212,u629,m40,CRAIG,"Invade?! That's impossible, it --"
19796,L110211,u641,m40,WALLACE,I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
19797,L110210,u629,m40,CRAIG,But... what will you do?
19798,L110438,u629,m40,CRAIG,You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
19799,L110437,u639,m40,ROBERT,Longshanks promised!
19800,L110428,u639,m40,ROBERT,He will. I know he will.
19801,L110427,u629,m40,CRAIG,He won't come.
19802,L110409,u629,m40,CRAIG,"That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace."
19803,L110408,u639,m40,ROBERT,The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
19804,L110407,u629,m40,CRAIG,Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
19805,L110406,u639,m40,ROBERT,"If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?"
19806,L110403,u629,m40,CRAIG,"It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear."
19807,L110402,u639,m40,ROBERT,He was a modest man.
19808,L110401,u629,m40,CRAIG,May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
19809,L110197,u629,m40,CRAIG,"No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must."
19810,L110196,u639,m40,ROBERT,Does anyone know his politics?
19811,L109897,u639,m40,ROBERT,He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
19812,L109896,u629,m40,CRAIG,A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
19813,L109893,u629,m40,CRAIG,Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
19814,L109892,u639,m40,ROBERT,My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
19815,L109891,u629,m40,CRAIG,"Young Robert, we are honored --"
19816,L110360,u630,m40,EDWARD,You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
19817,L110359,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
19818,L110348,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,"He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?"
19819,L110347,u630,m40,EDWARD,But if we have not caught Wallace --
19820,L110346,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
19821,L110345,u630,m40,EDWARD,The Scots will fight for us?
19822,L110344,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
19823,L110291,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,"So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand."
19824,L110290,u630,m40,EDWARD,The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
19825,L110241,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
19826,L110240,u630,m40,EDWARD,Wallace has sacked York!
19827,L110239,u630,m40,EDWARD,I have ordered conscriptions...
19828,L110238,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,"While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!"
19829,L110237,u630,m40,EDWARD,"Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word."
19830,L110236,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,What news of the north?
19831,L110023,u630,m40,EDWARD,"I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more."
19832,L110022,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
19833,L110471,u630,m40,EDWARD,"Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead."
19834,L110470,u638,m40,PRINCESS,Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
19835,L110468,u638,m40,PRINCESS,I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
19836,L110467,u630,m40,EDWARD,You fancy him.
19837,L110466,u638,m40,PRINCESS,I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
19838,L110436,u630,m40,EDWARD,"Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed."
19839,L110435,u638,m40,PRINCESS,When will his trial be?
19840,L110434,u630,m40,EDWARD,"Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation."
19841,L110433,u638,m40,PRINCESS,Is it true? Wallace is captured?
19842,L110370,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush."
19843,L110369,u630,m40,EDWARD,The little cow is insane --
19844,L110365,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way."
19845,L110364,u630,m40,EDWARD,Wallace's followers.
19846,L110363,u638,m40,PRINCESS,I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
19847,L110362,u630,m40,EDWARD,You mock us with a smile?
19848,L110361,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Good day to you, M'Lords."
19849,L109887,u630,m40,EDWARD,You may.
19850,L109886,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord."
19851,L109885,u630,m40,EDWARD,"Now, my flower, do you understand?"
19852,L109884,u630,m40,EDWARD,Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
19853,L109883,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"No, M'lord."
19854,L109880,u630,m40,EDWARD,"All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!"
19855,L109879,u638,m40,PRINCESS,...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
19856,L109878,u630,m40,EDWARD,"Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!"
19857,L109876,u638,m40,PRINCESS,Scotland. He intends --
19858,L109875,u630,m40,EDWARD,So I did! And what was so important about it?
19859,L109874,u638,m40,PRINCESS,You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
19860,L109873,u630,m40,EDWARD,What is it?!
19861,L110426,u641,m40,WALLACE,No. One of us is enough.
19862,L110425,u631,m40,HAMISH,Keep these. We're going too.
19863,L110424,u641,m40,WALLACE,"My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it."
19864,L110423,u631,m40,HAMISH,"Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?"
19865,L110422,u641,m40,WALLACE,We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
19866,L110421,u631,m40,HAMISH,"That's just a dream, William!"
19867,L110420,u641,m40,WALLACE,"Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too."
19868,L110419,u631,m40,HAMISH,I don't want to be a martyr.
19869,L110418,u641,m40,WALLACE,Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
19870,L110417,u631,m40,HAMISH,You know it's a trap.
19871,L110398,u631,m40,HAMISH,Your rest is making me exhausted.
19872,L110397,u641,m40,WALLACE,I rest.
19873,L110396,u631,m40,HAMISH,"Rest, William."
19874,L110376,u631,m40,HAMISH,"We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya."
19875,L110375,u641,m40,WALLACE,Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
19876,L110317,u631,m40,HAMISH,Aye.
19877,L110316,u641,m40,WALLACE,Stephen ready?
19878,L110315,u641,m40,WALLACE,Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
19879,L110314,u631,m40,HAMISH,"The Bruce is not coming, William."
19880,L110052,u631,m40,HAMISH,Fourteen? --
19881,L110051,u641,m40,WALLACE,We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
19882,L110046,u641,m40,WALLACE,"Hamish, I... thank..."
19883,L110045,u631,m40,HAMISH,I'll wait... back there.
19884,L109927,u631,m40,HAMISH,I should'a remembered the eggs.
19885,L109926,u642,m40,WILLIAM,Good to see you again.
19886,L109916,u642,m40,WILLIAM,I will not.
19887,L109915,u631,m40,HAMISH,You'll move
19888,L109913,u631,m40,HAMISH,I could crush you like a roach.
19889,L109912,u642,m40,WILLIAM,Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
19890,L109911,u631,m40,HAMISH,That depends on the man.
19891,L109910,u642,m40,WILLIAM,I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
19892,L109907,u642,m40,WILLIAM,The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
19893,L109906,u631,m40,HAMISH,"Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones."
19894,L109905,u642,m40,WILLIAM,You win.
19895,L109904,u631,m40,HAMISH,Test of manhood.
19896,L109833,u642,m40,WILLIAM,"Aye, we'll get 'em."
19897,L109832,u631,m40,HAMISH,We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
19898,L109831,u642,m40,WILLIAM,I wanna have supper waitin'.
19899,L109830,u631,m40,HAMISH,Wanna stay with me tonight?
19900,L109828,u642,m40,WILLIAM,"It's up to us, Hamish!"
19901,L109827,u631,m40,HAMISH,"With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!"
19902,L109826,u642,m40,WILLIAM,"They're English soldiers, ain't they?"
19903,L109825,u631,m40,HAMISH,Armed?
19904,L109824,u642,m40,WILLIAM,"Three, maybe more!"
19905,L109823,u631,m40,HAMISH,How many?
19906,L109822,u642,m40,WILLIAM,They're coming!
19907,L110089,u640,m40,STEPHEN,"They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!"
19908,L110088,u631,m40,HAMISH,We don't split up!
19909,L110087,u640,m40,STEPHEN,We must run in different directions!
19910,L110069,u640,m40,STEPHEN,A patriot!
19911,L110068,u631,m40,HAMISH,A common thief.
19912,L110067,u640,m40,STEPHEN,"Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity."
19913,L110063,u640,m40,STEPHEN,"In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question."
19914,L110062,u631,m40,HAMISH,Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
19915,L110061,u640,m40,STEPHEN,"All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?"
19916,L110355,u633,m40,LEPER,All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
19917,L110354,u639,m40,ROBERT,In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
19918,L110353,u633,m40,LEPER,"We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve."
19919,L110352,u639,m40,ROBERT,He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
19920,L110351,u633,m40,LEPER,So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
19921,L110350,u639,m40,ROBERT,He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
19922,L110349,u633,m40,LEPER,I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
19923,L110368,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them."
19924,L110367,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,Let her speak.
19925,L110366,u638,m40,PRINCESS,I have faced him. Have you?
19926,L110289,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
19927,L110288,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule."
19928,L110287,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
19929,L110286,u638,m40,PRINCESS,No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
19930,L110284,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Humbly, M'lord."
19931,L110283,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,"The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery."
19932,L110282,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord."
19933,L110281,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
19934,L110280,u638,m40,PRINCESS,He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
19935,L110279,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
19936,L110278,u638,m40,PRINCESS,No. He did not.
19937,L110277,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,"My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe."
19938,L109869,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,"If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him."
19939,L109868,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Shall I leave, M'lord?"
19940,L109867,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
19941,L109866,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead."
19942,L109865,u634,m40,LONGSHANKS,Where is my son?
19943,L110447,u635,m40,MAGISTRATE,"Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe."
19944,L110446,u641,m40,WALLACE,I do not confess.
19945,L110445,u635,m40,MAGISTRATE,"Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!"
19946,L110444,u641,m40,WALLACE,"-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!"
19947,L110443,u635,m40,MAGISTRATE,"It matters not, he is thy king!"
19948,L110442,u641,m40,WALLACE,"Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --"
19949,L110441,u635,m40,MAGISTRATE,"Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?"
19950,L110440,u641,m40,WALLACE,Treason. Against whom?
19951,L109978,u636,m40,MARION,...Tonight!
19952,L109977,u642,m40,WILLIAM,Then when?
19953,L109976,u636,m40,MARION,My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
19954,L109975,u642,m40,WILLIAM,Tonight then.
19955,L109974,u636,m40,MARION,Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
19956,L109973,u642,m40,WILLIAM,I've missed you.
19957,L109967,u642,m40,WILLIAM,"I will be with you, like this. Forever."
19958,L109966,u636,m40,MARION,This night is too beautiful to have again.
19959,L109965,u642,m40,WILLIAM,"I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one."
19960,L109964,u636,m40,MARION,You scare me.
19961,L109963,u642,m40,WILLIAM,But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
19962,L109962,u636,m40,MARION,Nor I!
19963,L109961,u642,m40,WILLIAM,I'm not just saying it!
19964,L109960,u636,m40,MARION,I... accept your proposal!
19965,L109959,u642,m40,WILLIAM,I want... to marry you!
19966,L109958,u642,m40,WILLIAM,No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
19967,L109957,u636,m40,MARION,Did it work?
19968,L109956,u642,m40,WILLIAM,Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
19969,L109955,u636,m40,MARION,You've been here before?
19970,L109944,u636,m40,MARION,You are. And I'll come again.
19971,L109943,u642,m40,WILLIAM,"I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy."
19972,L109942,u636,m40,MARION,Thank you for inviting.
19973,L109941,u642,m40,WILLIAM,Thank you for accepting.
19974,L109940,u636,m40,MARION,It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
19975,L109939,u642,m40,WILLIAM,"Your father doesn't like me, does he?"
19976,L110083,u636,m40,MARION,"Wake up, William. Wake up!"
19977,L110082,u641,m40,WALLACE,I need you so much! I love you!
19978,L110081,u636,m40,MARION,And I with you. But you must wake.
19979,L110080,u641,m40,WALLACE,I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
19980,L110079,u636,m40,MARION,"Yes, you are. And you must wake."
19981,L110078,u641,m40,WALLACE,I'm dreaming.
19982,L110122,u638,m40,PRINCESS,...I wouldn't know.
19983,L110121,u637,m40,NICOLETTE,"Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?"
19984,L110120,u637,m40,NICOLETTE,"A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did."
19985,L110119,u638,m40,PRINCESS,This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
19986,L110118,u637,m40,NICOLETTE,"Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for."
19987,L110117,u638,m40,PRINCESS,He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
19988,L110116,u637,m40,NICOLETTE,Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
19989,L110115,u638,m40,PRINCESS,How do you know this?
19990,L110114,u637,m40,NICOLETTE,When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
19991,L110465,u638,m40,PRINCESS,I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
19992,L110464,u641,m40,WALLACE,"It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me."
19993,L110463,u638,m40,PRINCESS,Drink this! It will dull your pain.
19994,L110462,u641,m40,WALLACE,Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
19995,L110461,u638,m40,PRINCESS,You will die! It will be awful!
19996,L110459,u641,m40,WALLACE,"If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already."
19997,L110458,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live."
19998,L110457,u641,m40,WALLACE,"Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?"
19999,L110456,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy."
20000,L110455,u641,m40,WALLACE,M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
20001,L110393,u638,m40,PRINCESS,No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
20002,L110392,u641,m40,WALLACE,I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
20003,L110391,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?"
20004,L110390,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises."
20005,L110389,u641,m40,WALLACE,You have... you have a husband.
20006,L110386,u638,m40,PRINCESS,Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
20007,L110385,u641,m40,WALLACE,Why did you?
20008,L110380,u638,m40,PRINCESS,It does me good to see you.
20009,L110379,u641,m40,WALLACE,A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
20010,L110274,u641,m40,WALLACE,She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
20011,L110273,u638,m40,PRINCESS,I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
20012,L110272,u641,m40,WALLACE,SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
20013,L110271,u638,m40,PRINCESS,Peace is made is such ways.
20014,L110270,u641,m40,WALLACE,A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
20015,L110269,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally."
20016,L110260,u638,m40,PRINCESS,That is not possible.
20017,L110259,u641,m40,WALLACE,"York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls."
20018,L110258,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?"
20019,L110257,u641,m40,WALLACE,I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
20020,L110256,u638,m40,PRINCESS,I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
20021,L110255,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?"
20022,L110254,u641,m40,WALLACE,"It's battle I want, not talk."
20023,L110253,u638,m40,PRINCESS,"I come as the king's servant, and with his authority."
20024,L110252,u641,m40,WALLACE,"Wife of Edward, the king's son?"
20025,L110251,u638,m40,PRINCESS,I am the Princess of Wales.
20026,L110309,u641,m40,WALLACE,And I will consult with mine.
20027,L110308,u639,m40,ROBERT,I must... consult with my father.
20028,L110307,u641,m40,WALLACE,Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
20029,L110306,u639,m40,ROBERT,I am trying.
20030,L110305,u641,m40,WALLACE,War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
20031,L110220,u641,m40,WALLACE,"Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I."
20032,L110219,u639,m40,ROBERT,I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
20033,L110218,u641,m40,WALLACE,We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
20034,L110217,u639,m40,ROBERT,"No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead."
20035,L110216,u641,m40,WALLACE,"And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?"
20036,L110215,u639,m40,ROBERT,"Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk."
20037,L110400,u641,m40,WALLACE,Aye. But it won't let me dream.
20038,L110399,u640,m40,STEPHEN,"Come, it'll help you sleep."
20039,L110156,u641,m40,WALLACE,Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
20040,L110155,u640,m40,STEPHEN,Fine speech. Now what do we do?
20041,L110107,u641,m40,WALLACE,No English lord would trust an Irishman!
20042,L110106,u640,m40,STEPHEN,I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
20043,L110099,u641,m40,WALLACE,Exactly.
20044,L110098,u640,m40,STEPHEN,Who would do such a thing?
20045,L110097,u641,m40,WALLACE,The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
20046,L110096,u640,m40,STEPHEN,"What's the crazy man saying, Lord?"
20047,L110095,u641,m40,WALLACE,They've tricked us.
20048,L110094,u640,m40,STEPHEN,We can't stop!
20049,L117640,u653,m41,MRS. BOSWELL,"When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it."
20050,L117639,u643,m41,ANDREA,What?
20051,L117638,u653,m41,MRS. BOSWELL,"Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it..."
20052,L117637,u643,m41,ANDREA,Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
20053,L117635,u653,m41,MRS. BOSWELL,"Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this..."
20054,L117634,u643,m41,ANDREA,What is it?
20055,L117633,u653,m41,MRS. BOSWELL,"I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first."
20056,L117630,u643,m41,ANDREA,"I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --"
20057,L117629,u653,m41,MRS. BOSWELL,Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
20058,L118342,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
20059,L118341,u643,m41,ANDREA,"No dances, just tell me."
20060,L118162,u643,m41,ANDREA,So what did you find.
20061,L118161,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago."
20062,L117772,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!"
20063,L117771,u643,m41,ANDREA,"Evan wake up, oh please wake up!"
20064,L117707,u643,m41,ANDREA,How soon?...
20065,L117706,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex."
20066,L117705,u643,m41,ANDREA,"Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off."
20067,L117704,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,You'd be surprised how often they are.
20068,L117703,u643,m41,ANDREA,"Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple."
20069,L117702,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
20070,L117701,u643,m41,ANDREA,But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
20071,L117700,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related."
20072,L117699,u643,m41,ANDREA,But you must have something to go on?
20073,L117698,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now."
20074,L117697,u643,m41,ANDREA,And the bad news?
20075,L117696,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors..."
20076,L117668,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
20077,L117667,u643,m41,ANDREA,Why? What for?
20078,L117666,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
20079,L117665,u643,m41,ANDREA,Anything.
20080,L117664,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory."
20081,L117663,u643,m41,ANDREA,Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
20082,L117653,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out."
20083,L117652,u643,m41,ANDREA,Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
20084,L117651,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
20085,L118302,u646,m41,EVAN,Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
20086,L118301,u643,m41,ANDREA,Just. Like. Jason.
20087,L118300,u646,m41,EVAN,"You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you."
20088,L118299,u643,m41,ANDREA,How. Did you. Know that?
20089,L118298,u646,m41,EVAN,"Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts."
20090,L118297,u643,m41,ANDREA,You're. Acting. Like your father.
20091,L118292,u646,m41,EVAN,"I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it."
20092,L118291,u643,m41,ANDREA,Fix?
20093,L118290,u646,m41,EVAN,There must be a way to fix this.
20094,L118167,u646,m41,EVAN,"He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?"
20095,L118166,u643,m41,ANDREA,What does that mean for Evan?
20096,L118158,u643,m41,ANDREA,"Cute, Evan."
20097,L118157,u646,m41,EVAN,"Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?"
20098,L118105,u643,m41,ANDREA,"Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now."
20099,L118104,u646,m41,EVAN,"Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!"
20100,L118103,u643,m41,ANDREA,I found these. The others are still in storage.
20101,L118101,u646,m41,EVAN,How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
20102,L118100,u643,m41,ANDREA,I don't know. These things take time.
20103,L118099,u646,m41,EVAN,How long will I be in here?
20104,L118098,u643,m41,ANDREA,"...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient."
20105,L117926,u646,m41,EVAN,What? What could he do?
20106,L117925,u643,m41,ANDREA,"And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could..."
20107,L117924,u646,m41,EVAN,Sure...
20108,L117923,u643,m41,ANDREA,"I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them..."
20109,L117922,u643,m41,ANDREA,When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
20110,L117921,u646,m41,EVAN,"No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten."
20111,L117920,u643,m41,ANDREA,Why do you ask?
20112,L117919,u646,m41,EVAN,Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
20113,L117918,u643,m41,ANDREA,Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
20114,L117917,u646,m41,EVAN,Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
20115,L117916,u643,m41,ANDREA,I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
20116,L117915,u646,m41,EVAN,"Please, mom. People will talk."
20117,L117750,u643,m41,ANDREA,Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
20118,L117749,u646,m41,EVAN,I... I blacked out.
20119,L117748,u643,m41,ANDREA,Something must've happened! What set him off?
20120,L117747,u646,m41,EVAN,I don't know... I don't remember.
20121,L117711,u646,m41,EVAN,Okay.
20122,L117710,u643,m41,ANDREA,"Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?"
20123,L117676,u646,m41,EVAN,I... I don't remember.
20124,L117675,u643,m41,ANDREA,Honey. What were you doing with that?
20125,L117674,u646,m41,EVAN,What happened?
20126,L117671,u643,m41,ANDREA,Great. I'll see you soon.
20127,L117670,u646,m41,EVAN,"These'll bring you luck, Crockett."
20128,L117660,u646,m41,EVAN,"My father has a bad memory, too?"
20129,L117659,u643,m41,ANDREA,"That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss."
20130,L117656,u643,m41,ANDREA,You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
20131,L117655,u646,m41,EVAN,"I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!"
20132,L117625,u643,m41,ANDREA,Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
20133,L117624,u646,m41,EVAN,No.
20134,L117623,u643,m41,ANDREA,"I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?"
20135,L117622,u646,m41,EVAN,All the dads are gonna be there.
20136,L117620,u646,m41,EVAN,But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
20137,L117619,u643,m41,ANDREA,We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
20138,L117618,u646,m41,EVAN,Can't he come out for one day?
20139,L117617,u643,m41,ANDREA,You know the answer to that.
20140,L117616,u646,m41,EVAN,Um... can dad come this time?
20141,L117615,u643,m41,ANDREA,Darn it!
20142,L117614,u643,m41,ANDREA,"Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time."
20143,L117613,u646,m41,EVAN,"Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy."
20144,L117612,u646,m41,EVAN,We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
20145,L117611,u643,m41,ANDREA,When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
20146,L117610,u646,m41,EVAN,We're gonna be late again.
20147,L118133,u646,m41,EVAN,So you believe me?
20148,L118132,u644,m41,CARLOS,Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
20149,L118131,u646,m41,EVAN,What did you see? What did it look like?
20150,L118125,u646,m41,EVAN,"Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess."
20151,L118124,u644,m41,CARLOS,Weirder than this?
20152,L118123,u646,m41,EVAN,Just tell me if anything weird happens.
20153,L118120,u644,m41,CARLOS,"You need to see the prison shrink, man."
20154,L118119,u646,m41,EVAN,"So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely."
20155,L118117,u646,m41,EVAN,I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
20156,L118116,u644,m41,CARLOS,Shit. I knew you were crazy.
20157,L118115,u646,m41,EVAN,Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
20158,L118114,u644,m41,CARLOS,Straight up.
20159,L118113,u646,m41,EVAN,"You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about ""the Lord works in mysterious ways?"""
20160,L118097,u644,m41,CARLOS,"Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else."
20161,L118096,u646,m41,EVAN,Can you protect me?
20162,L118095,u644,m41,CARLOS,Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
20163,L118339,u646,m41,EVAN,Photos?
20164,L118338,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
20165,L118337,u646,m41,EVAN,But I... I need those books.
20166,L118336,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia..."
20167,L118334,u646,m41,EVAN,My journals! Where are they?
20168,L118333,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,Books?
20169,L118332,u646,m41,EVAN,Where are my goddamn books?
20170,L118331,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour."
20171,L118164,u646,m41,EVAN,Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
20172,L118163,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
20173,L118160,u646,m41,EVAN,Are you sure? Not even with my father?
20174,L118159,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
20175,L117765,u646,m41,EVAN,It's coming... argh! I can't!
20176,L117764,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car."
20177,L117763,u646,m41,EVAN,I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
20178,L117762,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe."
20179,L117760,u646,m41,EVAN,I see a car.
20180,L117759,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
20181,L117758,u646,m41,EVAN,"No, protecting her."
20182,L117757,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,Are you hurting her?
20183,L117756,u646,m41,EVAN,"I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears."
20184,L117755,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,Where are you now?
20185,L117754,u646,m41,EVAN,Yes.
20186,L117753,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?"
20187,L117709,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Not in this wing, actually. No."
20188,L117708,u646,m41,EVAN,Dad lives here?
20189,L117658,u646,m41,EVAN,You know my father?
20190,L117657,u645,m41,DR. REDFIELD,"Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father."
20191,L118241,u655,m41,THUMPER,"Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all."
20192,L118240,u646,m41,EVAN,Get out. Both of you.
20193,L118023,u655,m41,THUMPER,"Fuck off, frat boy."
20194,L118022,u646,m41,EVAN,Huh?
20195,L118021,u655,m41,THUMPER,Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
20196,L117933,u655,m41,THUMPER,"Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!"
20197,L117932,u646,m41,EVAN,What?
20198,L117931,u655,m41,THUMPER,Are you stupid or what?
20199,L117930,u646,m41,EVAN,Shhh! I need quiet for this.
20200,L117929,u655,m41,THUMPER,What the fuck are you doing?
20201,L117928,u646,m41,EVAN,I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
20202,L117897,u646,m41,EVAN,All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
20203,L117896,u655,m41,THUMPER,You really think he wanted to kill you?
20204,L117855,u655,m41,THUMPER,That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
20205,L117854,u646,m41,EVAN,"Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories."
20206,L117851,u655,m41,THUMPER,Like Ozzy.
20207,L117850,u646,m41,EVAN,"It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever."
20208,L117842,u646,m41,EVAN,This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
20209,L117841,u655,m41,THUMPER,I thought you were a December baby.
20210,L117840,u646,m41,EVAN,"Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday."
20211,L118280,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends."
20212,L118279,u646,m41,EVAN,Then you think it might have worked out?
20213,L118278,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine."
20214,L118277,u646,m41,EVAN,And...?
20215,L118276,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,It's crossed my mind from time to time.
20216,L118275,u646,m41,EVAN,I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
20217,L118274,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again."
20218,L118273,u646,m41,EVAN,I don't get it.
20219,L118272,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
20220,L118271,u646,m41,EVAN,I was?
20221,L118270,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about."
20222,L118269,u646,m41,EVAN,"Kayleigh? Do you ever think about ""us?"" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?"
20223,L118268,u646,m41,EVAN,"Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something."
20224,L118267,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Is something the matter?
20225,L118266,u646,m41,EVAN,"He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck."
20226,L118265,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
20227,L118253,u646,m41,EVAN,Stop! Take me back!
20228,L118252,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
20229,L118251,u646,m41,EVAN,Where are we going?
20230,L118238,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family."
20231,L118237,u646,m41,EVAN,I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
20232,L118236,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act."
20233,L118235,u646,m41,EVAN,Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
20234,L118234,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Sure you don't want your wallet?
20235,L118233,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
20236,L118232,u646,m41,EVAN,Which is?
20237,L118231,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,There's one major hole in your story.
20238,L118230,u646,m41,EVAN,That I didn't leave you there to rot.
20239,L118229,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Know what?
20240,L118228,u646,m41,EVAN,I just thought you should know.
20241,L118226,u646,m41,EVAN,"Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister."
20242,L118225,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
20243,L118224,u646,m41,EVAN,Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
20244,L118223,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Oh? There's proof now?
20245,L118222,u646,m41,EVAN,"I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you."
20246,L118221,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
20247,L118220,u646,m41,EVAN,"I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again."
20248,L118219,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"You're right, Evan, I don't believe you."
20249,L118218,u646,m41,EVAN,Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
20250,L118217,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
20251,L118216,u646,m41,EVAN,Yeah?
20252,L118215,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
20253,L118214,u646,m41,EVAN,Different? How?
20254,L118213,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Because you're... different.
20255,L118212,u646,m41,EVAN,Why's that?
20256,L118211,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case."
20257,L118210,u646,m41,EVAN,"You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, ""You wouldn't believe me"", but in this case, it's not even worth trying."
20258,L118209,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,What's happened to you?
20259,L118208,u646,m41,EVAN,The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
20260,L118207,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Ha! Where's that?
20261,L118206,u646,m41,EVAN,No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
20262,L118205,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?"
20263,L118204,u646,m41,EVAN,I get it. You can drop it now.
20264,L118203,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor."
20265,L118197,u646,m41,EVAN,"Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?"
20266,L118196,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone."
20267,L118147,u646,m41,EVAN,Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
20268,L118146,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
20269,L118145,u646,m41,EVAN,"I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --"
20270,L118091,u646,m41,EVAN,He's a fucking maniac!
20271,L118090,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!"
20272,L118080,u646,m41,EVAN,What?
20273,L118079,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
20274,L118078,u646,m41,EVAN,I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
20275,L118077,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but..."
20276,L118076,u646,m41,EVAN,I walk differently?
20277,L118075,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
20278,L118074,u646,m41,EVAN,Like how?
20279,L118073,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?"
20280,L118072,u646,m41,EVAN,What do you mean?
20281,L118071,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Are you okay?
20282,L118069,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
20283,L118068,u646,m41,EVAN,"Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine."
20284,L118067,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids."
20285,L118066,u646,m41,EVAN,"Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett."
20286,L118065,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me."
20287,L118064,u646,m41,EVAN,Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
20288,L118063,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
20289,L118055,u646,m41,EVAN,Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
20290,L118054,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Why are you doing all this for me?
20291,L118053,u646,m41,EVAN,Go on. Sit down.
20292,L118052,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
20293,L118051,u646,m41,EVAN,You'll see.
20294,L118050,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"I don't understand, where are you taking me?"
20295,L118043,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
20296,L118042,u646,m41,EVAN,"What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?"
20297,L118039,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird."
20298,L118038,u646,m41,EVAN,So it didn't feel... weird?
20299,L118037,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?"
20300,L118015,u646,m41,EVAN,I dunno.  Just being weird.
20301,L118014,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?"
20302,L118013,u646,m41,EVAN,"Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?"
20303,L118006,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Those are your clothes, silly."
20304,L118005,u646,m41,EVAN,Where... where are my clothes?
20305,L118004,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
20306,L118003,u646,m41,EVAN,"Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible."
20307,L117969,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!"
20308,L117968,u646,m41,EVAN,You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
20309,L117967,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath."
20310,L117962,u646,m41,EVAN,"No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us."
20311,L117961,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
20312,L117960,u646,m41,EVAN,"I know, but..."
20313,L117959,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,It was a long time ago.
20314,L117958,u646,m41,EVAN,It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
20315,L117957,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"What do you want to know, Evan?"
20316,L117956,u646,m41,EVAN,When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
20317,L117955,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot."
20318,L117954,u646,m41,EVAN,"Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help."
20319,L117953,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Of course.
20320,L117952,u646,m41,EVAN,Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
20321,L117951,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Me? Are you kidding? Why?
20322,L117950,u646,m41,EVAN,"Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you."
20323,L117949,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
20324,L117948,u646,m41,EVAN,Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
20325,L117947,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Not if you remember my dad.
20326,L117946,u646,m41,EVAN,Wow. That must've taken some courage.
20327,L117945,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
20328,L117943,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
20329,L117942,u646,m41,EVAN,So how's Tommy?
20330,L117941,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,I've stopped a hundred times.
20331,L117940,u646,m41,EVAN,Not since we were kids.
20332,L117939,u646,m41,EVAN,I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
20333,L117938,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in."
20334,L117937,u646,m41,EVAN,"Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know..."
20335,L117936,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?"
20336,L117815,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Hi, Lenny."
20337,L117814,u646,m41,EVAN,Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
20338,L117809,u646,m41,EVAN,"He must be. They're letting him go, right?"
20339,L117808,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
20340,L117807,u646,m41,EVAN,"Duck, here they come."
20341,L117806,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
20342,L117805,u646,m41,EVAN,"I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?"
20343,L117795,u646,m41,EVAN,What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
20344,L117794,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,I deserve a lot worse.
20345,L117793,u646,m41,EVAN,Damn. Your dad did this?
20346,L117792,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
20347,L117791,u646,m41,EVAN,I'm sorry.
20348,L117790,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Ouch.
20349,L117787,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,You really don't remember anything that happened?
20350,L117786,u646,m41,EVAN,I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
20351,L117743,u646,m41,EVAN,"Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!"
20352,L117742,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Oh God... what did we do?
20353,L117722,u646,m41,EVAN,So let's go. This place creeps me out.
20354,L117721,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead."
20355,L118326,u646,m41,EVAN,"Been there, done that."
20356,L118325,u652,m41,MR. MILLER,That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
20357,L118324,u646,m41,EVAN,And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
20358,L118323,u652,m41,MR. MILLER,"Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty."
20359,L117995,u646,m41,EVAN,"Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you."
20360,L117994,u652,m41,MR. MILLER,...yes.
20361,L117993,u646,m41,EVAN,"Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?"
20362,L117992,u652,m41,MR. MILLER,Who -- who are you?
20363,L117991,u646,m41,EVAN,"It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy."
20364,L117990,u652,m41,MR. MILLER,What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
20365,L117989,u646,m41,EVAN,"Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood."
20366,L117988,u652,m41,MR. MILLER,It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
20367,L117987,u646,m41,EVAN,What time is it?
20368,L117694,u646,m41,EVAN,Kayleigh? What happened?
20369,L117693,u652,m41,MR. MILLER,Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
20370,L117692,u646,m41,EVAN,I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
20371,L117691,u652,m41,MR. MILLER,"Calm down, kid. Stand still."
20372,L117690,u646,m41,EVAN,Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
20373,L117687,u652,m41,MR. MILLER,"That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star."
20374,L117686,u646,m41,EVAN,We're really gonna be in a movie!?
20375,L118184,u646,m41,EVAN,Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
20376,L118183,u649,m41,JASON,"You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother."
20377,L118182,u646,m41,EVAN,Who's to say you can't make things better?
20378,L118181,u649,m41,JASON,"There is no ""right"". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were."
20379,L118180,u646,m41,EVAN,But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
20380,L118179,u649,m41,JASON,I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
20381,L118178,u646,m41,EVAN,"Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done."
20382,L118177,u649,m41,JASON,Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
20383,L117713,u646,m41,EVAN,Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
20384,L117712,u649,m41,JASON,"It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?"
20385,L118036,u648,m41,HUNTER,I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
20386,L118035,u646,m41,EVAN,"Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers..."
20387,L118034,u648,m41,HUNTER,"Damn, Evan, on the D.L."
20388,L118033,u646,m41,EVAN,You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
20389,L118032,u648,m41,HUNTER,Me neither.
20390,L118031,u646,m41,EVAN,We'll find out soon enough.
20391,L118030,u648,m41,HUNTER,"Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?"
20392,L118028,u654,m41,PROFESSOR CARTER,"The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin."
20393,L118027,u646,m41,EVAN,Evan Treborn.
20394,L118026,u654,m41,PROFESSOR CARTER,And you are...?
20395,L118025,u646,m41,EVAN,I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
20396,L118024,u654,m41,PROFESSOR CARTER,"Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due."
20397,L117914,u646,m41,EVAN,"I won't let you down, Professor Carter."
20398,L117913,u654,m41,PROFESSOR CARTER,"Just don't drop the ball, okay?"
20399,L117912,u654,m41,PROFESSOR CARTER,"I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?"
20400,L117911,u646,m41,EVAN,"Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't..."
20401,L117910,u654,m41,PROFESSOR CARTER,"Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming."
20402,L117834,u646,m41,EVAN,"Hey, I got no choice."
20403,L117833,u654,m41,PROFESSOR CARTER,Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
20404,L117832,u646,m41,EVAN,I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
20405,L117884,u647,m41,HEIDI,"Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?"
20406,L117883,u646,m41,EVAN,It didn't feel like a dream.
20407,L117875,u646,m41,EVAN,It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
20408,L117874,u647,m41,HEIDI,"Come on, go on..."
20409,L117871,u647,m41,HEIDI,Deal. Now read me something.
20410,L117870,u646,m41,EVAN,"Freeze! No ""worm-boy"". No ""Mr. Worm,"" and no ""Worm-Master-General!"" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?"
20411,L117867,u647,m41,HEIDI,Wow... read something.
20412,L117866,u646,m41,EVAN,Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
20413,L117865,u647,m41,HEIDI,"Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books."
20414,L117863,u647,m41,HEIDI,You're kidding. He's so... big.
20415,L117862,u646,m41,EVAN,Thumper had a busy afternoon.
20416,L117861,u647,m41,HEIDI,Smells like sex in here.
20417,L117857,u646,m41,EVAN,"Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain."
20418,L117856,u647,m41,HEIDI,So what's the point?
20419,L118312,u646,m41,EVAN,"If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh."
20420,L118311,u651,m41,LENNY,Destroy it?
20421,L118310,u646,m41,EVAN,Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
20422,L118309,u651,m41,LENNY,What?
20423,L118308,u646,m41,EVAN,Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
20424,L118307,u651,m41,LENNY,What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
20425,L118305,u646,m41,EVAN,My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
20426,L118304,u651,m41,LENNY,Are you sure you even packed it?
20427,L118262,u646,m41,EVAN,Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
20428,L118261,u651,m41,LENNY,"Uh, we should be getting to class now."
20429,L118174,u646,m41,EVAN,Y... yes. I guess I did.
20430,L118173,u651,m41,LENNY,"You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!"
20431,L117891,u651,m41,LENNY,Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
20432,L117890,u646,m41,EVAN,"Yeah, good, what else do you remember?"
20433,L117889,u651,m41,LENNY,I couldn't cut the rope.
20434,L117736,u651,m41,LENNY,"Gee, thanks friend."
20435,L117735,u646,m41,EVAN,That should buy you ten minutes at least.
20436,L117650,u646,m41,EVAN,"Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway."
20437,L117649,u651,m41,LENNY,Can... can... Can I have this?
20438,L118296,u656,m41,TOMMY,I think I'll go check out the chapel.
20439,L118295,u646,m41,EVAN,Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
20440,L118288,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately."
20441,L118287,u646,m41,EVAN,Lung cancer?
20442,L118260,u646,m41,EVAN,"Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke."
20443,L118259,u656,m41,TOMMY,"I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance."
20444,L118153,u646,m41,EVAN,"I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father."
20445,L118152,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Listen to me good, Evan..."
20446,L118089,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Right, Evan. I believe you just said ""sick fuck."""
20447,L118088,u646,m41,EVAN,"No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy."
20448,L118087,u656,m41,TOMMY,"It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit."
20449,L118086,u646,m41,EVAN,What the hell are you doing?
20450,L118083,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Get this ""us"" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself."
20451,L118082,u646,m41,EVAN,Leave us alone you sick fuck!
20452,L117823,u646,m41,EVAN,What's wrong with you?!
20453,L117822,u656,m41,TOMMY,Look what you made me do!
20454,L117741,u646,m41,EVAN,What happened?? Where are we?!
20455,L117740,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!"
20456,L117720,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid."
20457,L117719,u646,m41,EVAN,"Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?"
20458,L117647,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Fat little baby, crying for mommy."
20459,L117646,u646,m41,EVAN,"Hey, what'd you do that for?"
20460,L118191,u657,m41,WAITRESS,Sorry. Never heard of her.
20461,L118190,u646,m41,EVAN,"None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?"
20462,L118189,u657,m41,WAITRESS,Meant no offense.
20463,L118188,u646,m41,EVAN,I come from a big family.
20464,L118187,u657,m41,WAITRESS,Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
20465,L118186,u646,m41,EVAN,Huh?
20466,L118185,u657,m41,WAITRESS,"Just get out, didja?"
20467,L118085,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Aw, hey now, that was a compliment."
20468,L118084,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Shut up, Tommy!"
20469,L117906,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Oh my God oh my God...
20470,L117905,u656,m41,TOMMY,Lenny? Come on!
20471,L117775,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,I'm sorry.
20472,L117774,u656,m41,TOMMY,Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
20473,L117729,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already."
20474,L117728,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
20475,L117727,u656,m41,TOMMY,What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
20476,L117685,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff."
20477,L117684,u656,m41,TOMMY,I thought I was the bad guy!
20478,L117683,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!"
20479,L117682,u656,m41,TOMMY,I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
20480,L117681,u650,m41,KAYLEIGH,"Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie."
20481,L117900,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Yeah, you do that, Lenny."
20482,L117899,u651,m41,LENNY,Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
20483,L117733,u651,m41,LENNY,"Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed."
20484,L117732,u656,m41,TOMMY,"The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure."
20485,L117731,u651,m41,LENNY,"What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing."
20486,L117730,u656,m41,TOMMY,"Here you go, buddy."
20487,L117643,u656,m41,TOMMY,You're such a retard!
20488,L117642,u651,m41,LENNY,You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
20489,L119167,u667,m42,RICK,-- He's just a lucky guy.
20490,L119166,u658,m42,ANNINA,"Monsieur Rick, I --"
20491,L119142,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me."
20492,L119141,u658,m42,ANNINA,"Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is."
20493,L119140,u667,m42,RICK,Go back to Bulgaria.
20494,L119139,u658,m42,ANNINA,"Oh, yes, please."
20495,L119138,u667,m42,RICK,You want my advice?
20496,L119137,u658,m42,ANNINA,"And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?"
20497,L119136,u667,m42,RICK,Nobody ever loved me that much.
20498,L119134,u667,m42,RICK,He always has.
20499,L119133,u658,m42,ANNINA,-- Will he keep his word?
20500,L119132,u667,m42,RICK,And you want to know --
20501,L119131,u658,m42,ANNINA,"Yes, Monsieur."
20502,L119130,u667,m42,RICK,And he is still willing to give you a visa?
20503,L119129,u658,m42,ANNINA,"Oh, yes."
20504,L119128,u667,m42,RICK,Does he know that?
20505,L119127,u658,m42,ANNINA,"He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money."
20506,L119126,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, I'll bet."
20507,L119125,u658,m42,ANNINA,"Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us."
20508,L119124,u667,m42,RICK,So you decided to go to America.
20509,L119123,u658,m42,ANNINA,"Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country."
20510,L119122,u667,m42,RICK,How long have you been married?
20511,L119121,u658,m42,ANNINA,"At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing."
20512,L119120,u667,m42,RICK,I thought so. Where's your husband?
20513,L119119,u658,m42,ANNINA,He did. Captain Renault did.
20514,L119118,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?"
20515,L119117,u658,m42,ANNINA,"No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --"
20516,L119116,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so."
20517,L119115,u658,m42,ANNINA,"Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?"
20518,L119114,u658,m42,ANNINA,No.
20519,L119113,u667,m42,RICK,"No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?"
20520,L119112,u667,m42,RICK,"He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?"
20521,L119111,u658,m42,ANNINA,"My husband is with me, too."
20522,L119110,u667,m42,RICK,I should have known.
20523,L119109,u658,m42,ANNINA,I came with Captain Renault.
20524,L119108,u667,m42,RICK,How did you get in here? You're under age.
20525,L119107,u658,m42,ANNINA,"Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?"
20526,L119106,u667,m42,RICK,Yes?
20527,L119105,u658,m42,ANNINA,Monsieur Rick?
20528,L118725,u659,m42,BERGER,"But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come..."
20529,L118724,u665,m42,LASZLO,I see.
20530,L118722,u665,m42,LASZLO,"As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me."
20531,L118721,u659,m42,BERGER,We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
20532,L118720,u665,m42,LASZLO,"In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight."
20533,L118719,u659,m42,BERGER,"I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo."
20534,L118718,u665,m42,LASZLO,"A champagne cocktail, please."
20535,L118717,u659,m42,BERGER,"Yes, Monsieur."
20536,L118716,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?"
20537,L118674,u665,m42,LASZLO,I'm sorry. It is.
20538,L118673,u659,m42,BERGER,Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
20539,L118670,u659,m42,BERGER,"Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir."
20540,L118669,u665,m42,LASZLO,What is your name?
20541,L118668,u659,m42,BERGER,Good.
20542,L118666,u659,m42,BERGER,-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
20543,L118665,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Thank you, but I hardly think --"
20544,L118664,u659,m42,BERGER,You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
20545,L118663,u665,m42,LASZLO,Well?
20546,L118662,u659,m42,BERGER,"Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America."
20547,L119329,u660,m42,CARL,"Yes, sir."
20548,L119328,u667,m42,RICK,I want you to take Miss Lund home.
20549,L119327,u660,m42,CARL,"Yes, I come, I will do it."
20550,L119326,u667,m42,RICK,-- Tonight he forgot.
20551,L119325,u660,m42,CARL,But Sacha always puts out that light --
20552,L119324,u667,m42,RICK,I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
20553,L119323,u660,m42,CARL,"Yes, I come."
20554,L119322,u667,m42,RICK,Come up here a minute.
20555,L119321,u660,m42,CARL,The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
20556,L119269,u660,m42,CARL,"Goodnight, Monsieur Rick."
20557,L119268,u667,m42,RICK,Goodnight.
20558,L119267,u660,m42,CARL,I won't.
20559,L119266,u667,m42,RICK,-- Don't tell me where you're going.
20560,L119265,u660,m42,CARL,I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
20561,L119264,u667,m42,RICK,"Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?"
20562,L119263,u660,m42,CARL,"Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money."
20563,L119262,u667,m42,RICK,"Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary."
20564,L119261,u660,m42,CARL,"Oh, two weeks, maybe three."
20565,L119260,u667,m42,RICK,How long can I afford to stay closed?
20566,L119259,u660,m42,CARL,"Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick."
20567,L119170,u660,m42,CARL,Monsieur Rick!
20568,L119169,u667,m42,RICK,"No thanks, Carl."
20569,L119168,u660,m42,CARL,"Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?"
20570,L118537,u667,m42,RICK,That's all right.
20571,L118536,u661,m42,EMIL,"It shall not happen again, Monsieur."
20572,L118535,u667,m42,RICK,Here you are.
20573,L118523,u661,m42,EMIL,I'm awfully sorry.
20574,L118522,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time."
20575,L118521,u661,m42,EMIL,"I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --"
20576,L118520,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, I'll get it from the safe."
20577,L118519,u661,m42,EMIL,"Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money."
20578,L119051,u662,m42,EUROPEAN,It has been a pleasure to meet you.
20579,L119050,u670,m42,TOURIST,"Er, goodbye, sir."
20580,L119048,u662,m42,EUROPEAN,"I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you..."
20581,L119047,u670,m42,TOURIST,"Er, my check, please."
20582,L119046,u662,m42,EUROPEAN,I'd better be going.
20583,L119045,u670,m42,TOURIST,"Er, good luck, yes."
20584,L119044,u662,m42,EUROPEAN,"Here's to you, sir."
20585,L119387,u663,m42,FERRARI,I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
20586,L119386,u667,m42,RICK,"Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes."
20587,L119385,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, so long."
20588,L119384,u663,m42,FERRARI,Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
20589,L119383,u667,m42,RICK,"And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell."
20590,L119382,u663,m42,FERRARI,Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
20591,L119381,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes."
20592,L119380,u663,m42,FERRARI,"Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man."
20593,L119379,u667,m42,RICK,"It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do."
20594,L119378,u663,m42,FERRARI,"Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?"
20595,L118984,u663,m42,FERRARI,"Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner."
20596,L118983,u667,m42,RICK,That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
20597,L118982,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too."
20598,L118981,u663,m42,FERRARI,"Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are."
20599,L118980,u667,m42,RICK,I'll tell him when he comes in.
20600,L118979,u663,m42,FERRARI,Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
20601,L118978,u667,m42,RICK,And the carrying charges?
20602,L118977,u663,m42,FERRARI,"I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage."
20603,L118976,u667,m42,RICK,So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
20604,L118975,u663,m42,FERRARI,"If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune."
20605,L118974,u667,m42,RICK,Practically no one.
20606,L118973,u663,m42,FERRARI,Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
20607,L118972,u667,m42,RICK,You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
20608,L118971,u663,m42,FERRARI,The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
20609,L118970,u663,m42,FERRARI,"Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow."
20610,L118969,u667,m42,RICK,"I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short."
20611,L118968,u663,m42,FERRARI,No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
20612,L118967,u667,m42,RICK,I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
20613,L118473,u663,m42,FERRARI,"My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?"
20614,L118472,u667,m42,RICK,Suppose we do.
20615,L118471,u663,m42,FERRARI,Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
20616,L118470,u667,m42,RICK,Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
20617,L118469,u663,m42,FERRARI,That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
20618,L118468,u667,m42,RICK,I don't buy or sell human beings.
20619,L118467,u663,m42,FERRARI,What do you want for Sam?
20620,L118466,u667,m42,RICK,It's not for sale at any price.
20621,L118465,u663,m42,FERRARI,You haven't heard my offer.
20622,L118464,u667,m42,RICK,It's not for sale.
20623,L118463,u663,m42,FERRARI,"Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe."
20624,L118462,u667,m42,RICK,"Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?"
20625,L118461,u663,m42,FERRARI,"Hello, Rick."
20626,L119043,u665,m42,LASZLO,Good day.
20627,L119042,u663,m42,FERRARI,"It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur."
20628,L119040,u665,m42,LASZLO,Thank you very much. Good day.
20629,L119039,u663,m42,FERRARI,"He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance."
20630,L119038,u665,m42,LASZLO,Rick?
20631,L119037,u663,m42,FERRARI,"Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick."
20632,L119036,u665,m42,LASZLO,Do you know where they are?
20633,L119035,u663,m42,FERRARI,Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
20634,L119034,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Yes, something."
20635,L119033,u663,m42,FERRARI,"I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?"
20636,L119031,u663,m42,FERRARI,"Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?"
20637,L119030,u665,m42,LASZLO,"We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much."
20638,L119018,u663,m42,FERRARI,"-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles."
20639,L119017,u665,m42,LASZLO,I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
20640,L119014,u665,m42,LASZLO,Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
20641,L119013,u663,m42,FERRARI,"As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter."
20642,L119012,u665,m42,LASZLO,"You see, my dear, the word has gone around."
20643,L119229,u669,m42,STRASSER,"My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle."
20644,L119228,u664,m42,ILSA,And the other alternative?
20645,L119227,u669,m42,STRASSER,It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
20646,L119226,u664,m42,ILSA,What are they?
20647,L119225,u669,m42,STRASSER,There are only two other alternatives for him.
20648,L119224,u664,m42,ILSA,What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
20649,L119223,u669,m42,STRASSER,Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
20650,L119222,u664,m42,ILSA,Occupied France?
20651,L119221,u669,m42,STRASSER,"That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France."
20652,L119220,u664,m42,ILSA,This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
20653,L119219,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca."
20654,L118929,u664,m42,ILSA,You needn't be concerned about me.
20655,L118928,u669,m42,STRASSER,And Mademoiselle?
20656,L119471,u667,m42,RICK,"She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend."
20657,L119470,u664,m42,ILSA,Yes.
20658,L119462,u667,m42,RICK,"And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now..."
20659,L119461,u664,m42,ILSA,And I said I would never leave you.
20660,L119460,u667,m42,RICK,"We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night."
20661,L119459,u664,m42,ILSA,But what about us?
20662,L119458,u667,m42,RICK,"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life."
20663,L119457,u664,m42,ILSA,No.
20664,L119456,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it."
20665,L119453,u667,m42,RICK,"-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?"
20666,L119452,u664,m42,ILSA,"But Richard, no, I, I --"
20667,L119451,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong."
20668,L119450,u664,m42,ILSA,"No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --"
20669,L119449,u667,m42,RICK,I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
20670,L119448,u664,m42,ILSA,I don't understand. What about you?
20671,L119447,u667,m42,RICK,Because you're getting on that plane.
20672,L119446,u664,m42,ILSA,"But why my name, Richard?"
20673,L119406,u664,m42,ILSA,"Oh, Rick!"
20674,L119405,u667,m42,RICK,Everything is quite all right.
20675,L119404,u664,m42,ILSA,"But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?"
20676,L119403,u667,m42,RICK,"No, not yet."
20677,L119402,u664,m42,ILSA,"Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?"
20678,L119313,u664,m42,ILSA,I wish I didn't love you so much.
20679,L119312,u667,m42,RICK,"All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid."
20680,L119311,u664,m42,ILSA,"I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us."
20681,L119310,u667,m42,RICK,All except one. He won't have you.
20682,L119309,u664,m42,ILSA,"Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for."
20683,L119308,u667,m42,RICK,And Laszlo?
20684,L119307,u664,m42,ILSA,Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
20685,L119306,u667,m42,RICK,Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
20686,L119305,u664,m42,ILSA,"Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest."
20687,L119304,u667,m42,RICK,When did you first find out he was alive?
20688,L119303,u664,m42,ILSA,"Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me."
20689,L119302,u667,m42,RICK,Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
20690,L119301,u664,m42,ILSA,"It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: ""Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp."" I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you."
20691,L119300,u667,m42,RICK,And then?
20692,L119296,u667,m42,RICK,"If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you."
20693,L119295,u664,m42,ILSA,"For the last time, put them on the table."
20694,L119294,u667,m42,RICK,No.
20695,L119293,u664,m42,ILSA,Put them on the table.
20696,L119292,u667,m42,RICK,I don't have to. I've got them right here.
20697,L119291,u664,m42,ILSA,-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
20698,L119289,u667,m42,RICK,What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
20699,L119288,u664,m42,ILSA,"No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca."
20700,L119286,u667,m42,RICK,"-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want."
20701,L119285,u664,m42,ILSA,"Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --"
20702,L119284,u667,m42,RICK,-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
20703,L119283,u664,m42,ILSA,"Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --"
20704,L119282,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in."
20705,L119281,u664,m42,ILSA,"It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing."
20706,L119280,u667,m42,RICK,Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
20707,L119279,u664,m42,ILSA,"I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important."
20708,L119278,u667,m42,RICK,I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
20709,L119277,u664,m42,ILSA,"You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters."
20710,L119276,u667,m42,RICK,Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
20711,L119275,u664,m42,ILSA,Please.
20712,L119274,u667,m42,RICK,"You use ""Richard"" again? We're back in Paris."
20713,L119273,u664,m42,ILSA,"Richard, I had to see you."
20714,L119272,u667,m42,RICK,"I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?"
20715,L119271,u664,m42,ILSA,The stairs from the street.
20716,L119270,u667,m42,RICK,How did you get in?
20717,L119009,u664,m42,ILSA,"No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris."
20718,L119008,u667,m42,RICK,"All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there."
20719,L119007,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you."
20720,L119006,u664,m42,ILSA,You can believe that if you want to.
20721,L119005,u667,m42,RICK,"Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?"
20722,L119004,u664,m42,ILSA,"Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night."
20723,L119003,u667,m42,RICK,"Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know."
20724,L119002,u664,m42,ILSA,"I don't think I will, Rick."
20725,L119001,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober."
20726,L119000,u664,m42,ILSA,Yes.
20727,L118999,u667,m42,RICK,Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
20728,L118993,u664,m42,ILSA,It doesn't matter.
20729,L118992,u667,m42,RICK,I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
20730,L118909,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, ""Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid,"" it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?"
20731,L118908,u664,m42,ILSA,"It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love."
20732,L118907,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along."
20733,L118906,u664,m42,ILSA,I don't know the finish yet.
20734,L118905,u667,m42,RICK,Has it got a wow finish?
20735,L118904,u664,m42,ILSA,"Can I tell you a story, Rick?"
20736,L118903,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out."
20737,L118902,u664,m42,ILSA,I didn't count the days.
20738,L118901,u667,m42,RICK,"Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?"
20739,L118900,u664,m42,ILSA,"Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel."
20740,L118899,u667,m42,RICK,"It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. ""Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."""
20741,L118898,u664,m42,ILSA,"I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know."
20742,L118897,u667,m42,RICK,Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
20743,L118896,u664,m42,ILSA,Please.
20744,L118895,u667,m42,RICK,Especially tonight.
20745,L118894,u664,m42,ILSA,"No. No, Rick. Not tonight."
20746,L118893,u667,m42,RICK,Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
20747,L118887,u664,m42,ILSA,"I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know..."
20748,L118886,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?"
20749,L118885,u664,m42,ILSA,"Oh, darling!"
20750,L118884,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?"
20751,L118883,u664,m42,ILSA,That's too far ahead to plan.
20752,L118882,u667,m42,RICK,"All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?"
20753,L118881,u664,m42,ILSA,"No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?"
20754,L118880,u667,m42,RICK,-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
20755,L118879,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes, of course, we --"
20756,L118878,u667,m42,RICK,"No, no, no, no. We must leave."
20757,L118877,u664,m42,ILSA,"But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris."
20758,L118876,u667,m42,RICK,"I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened."
20759,L118875,u664,m42,ILSA,Strange. I know so very little about you.
20760,L118871,u667,m42,RICK,"Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away."
20761,L118870,u664,m42,ILSA,"Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?"
20762,L118869,u667,m42,RICK,Looking for a job.
20763,L118868,u664,m42,ILSA,Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
20764,L118867,u667,m42,RICK,"Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?"
20765,L118866,u664,m42,ILSA,"With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love."
20766,L118865,u664,m42,ILSA,It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
20767,L118864,u667,m42,RICK,My German's a little rusty.
20768,L118860,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor."
20769,L118859,u664,m42,ILSA,"Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here."
20770,L118857,u664,m42,ILSA,"Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions."
20771,L118856,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said ""no questions."""
20772,L118855,u664,m42,ILSA,That's easy. There was. He's dead.
20773,L118854,u667,m42,RICK,Uh huh.
20774,L118853,u664,m42,ILSA,Why there is no other man in my life?
20775,L118852,u667,m42,RICK,Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
20776,L118851,u664,m42,ILSA,Yes?
20777,L118850,u667,m42,RICK,And I was wondering.
20778,L118849,u664,m42,ILSA,I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
20779,L118848,u667,m42,RICK,In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
20780,L118847,u664,m42,ILSA,A franc for your thoughts.
20781,L118846,u667,m42,RICK,"Here's looking at you, kid."
20782,L118845,u664,m42,ILSA,"We said ""no questions."""
20783,L118844,u667,m42,RICK,Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
20784,L118799,u667,m42,RICK,He hasn't played it in a long time.
20785,L118798,u664,m42,ILSA,"There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam."
20786,L118797,u667,m42,RICK,I will.
20787,L118796,u664,m42,ILSA,Say goodnight to Sam for me.
20788,L118785,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again."
20789,L118784,u667,m42,RICK,"I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."
20790,L118783,u664,m42,ILSA,No.
20791,L118782,u667,m42,RICK,Not an easy day to forget.
20792,L118781,u664,m42,ILSA,"How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris."
20793,L118780,u667,m42,RICK,"-- It was ""La Belle Aurore."""
20794,L118752,u668,m42,SAM,"Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it."
20795,L118751,u664,m42,ILSA,"Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""
20796,L118750,u668,m42,SAM,"I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa."
20797,L118749,u664,m42,ILSA,"Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake."
20798,L118748,u668,m42,SAM,"Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him."
20799,L118747,u664,m42,ILSA,"You used to be a much better liar, Sam."
20800,L118746,u668,m42,SAM,"Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time."
20801,L118745,u664,m42,ILSA,Does he always leave so early?
20802,L118744,u668,m42,SAM,"Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home."
20803,L118743,u664,m42,ILSA,When will he be back?
20804,L118742,u668,m42,SAM,I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
20805,L118741,u664,m42,ILSA,Where is Rick?
20806,L118740,u668,m42,SAM,"Yes, ma'am."
20807,L118739,u664,m42,ILSA,"Some of the old songs, Sam."
20808,L118738,u668,m42,SAM,"Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge."
20809,L118737,u664,m42,ILSA,It's been a long time.
20810,L118736,u668,m42,SAM,"Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again."
20811,L118735,u664,m42,ILSA,"Hello, Sam."
20812,L119477,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you."
20813,L119476,u665,m42,LASZLO,Are you ready Ilsa?
20814,L119258,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Of course, I'll be careful."
20815,L119257,u664,m42,ILSA,Be careful.
20816,L119254,u665,m42,LASZLO,"-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear."
20817,L119253,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --"
20818,L119252,u665,m42,LASZLO,"I love you very much, my dear."
20819,L119251,u664,m42,ILSA,"No, Victor, there isn't."
20820,L119250,u665,m42,LASZLO,I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
20821,L119249,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes, Victor, I was."
20822,L119248,u665,m42,LASZLO,"When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?"
20823,L119247,u664,m42,ILSA,-- Yes?
20824,L119246,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Ilsa, I --"
20825,L119244,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Yes. He said, ""Ask your wife."" I don't know why he said that."
20826,L119243,u664,m42,ILSA,Ask me?
20827,L119242,u665,m42,LASZLO,He suggested I ask you.
20828,L119241,u664,m42,ILSA,Did he give any reason?
20829,L119240,u665,m42,LASZLO,"But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would."
20830,L119239,u664,m42,ILSA,Yes?
20831,L119238,u665,m42,LASZLO,Apparently he has the letters.
20832,L119237,u664,m42,ILSA,"Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?"
20833,L119236,u665,m42,LASZLO,"To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?"
20834,L119235,u664,m42,ILSA,"Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened."
20835,L119234,u665,m42,LASZLO,"I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife."
20836,L119233,u664,m42,ILSA,"Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight."
20837,L119232,u665,m42,LASZLO,Our faithful friend is still there.
20838,L119231,u665,m42,LASZLO,We'll discuss it later.
20839,L119230,u664,m42,ILSA,What happened with Rick?
20840,L119148,u665,m42,LASZLO,And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
20841,L119147,u664,m42,ILSA,He does. Could we have a table close to him?
20842,L119027,u665,m42,LASZLO,"I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa."
20843,L119026,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?"
20844,L119025,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Yes, I would."
20845,L119024,u664,m42,ILSA,"But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?"
20846,L119023,u665,m42,LASZLO,"No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you."
20847,L119021,u664,m42,ILSA,"No, Victor, no."
20848,L119020,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty."
20849,L119019,u664,m42,ILSA,"We are only interested in two visas, Signor."
20850,L118809,u665,m42,LASZLO,Goodnight.
20851,L118808,u664,m42,ILSA,Goodnight.
20852,L118801,u665,m42,LASZLO,Goodnight.
20853,L118800,u664,m42,ILSA,Goodnight.
20854,L118715,u665,m42,LASZLO,"I will, don't worry."
20855,L118714,u664,m42,ILSA,Be careful.
20856,L118713,u665,m42,LASZLO,I must find out what Berger knows.
20857,L118712,u665,m42,LASZLO,"We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?"
20858,L118711,u664,m42,ILSA,"Victor, I'm afraid for you."
20859,L118710,u665,m42,LASZLO,This time they really mean to stop me.
20860,L118683,u665,m42,LASZLO,Won't you join us?
20861,L118682,u664,m42,ILSA,You are very kind.
20862,L118661,u665,m42,LASZLO,"If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe."
20863,L118660,u664,m42,ILSA,"Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here."
20864,L119455,u664,m42,ILSA,You're saying this only to make me go.
20865,L119454,u666,m42,RENAULT,I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
20866,L118779,u664,m42,ILSA,"I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --"
20867,L118778,u666,m42,RENAULT,"I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous."
20868,L118763,u664,m42,ILSA,-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
20869,L118762,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Well then, perhaps you also ---"
20870,L118761,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?"
20871,L118760,u664,m42,ILSA,"Hello, Rick."
20872,L118695,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man."
20873,L118694,u664,m42,ILSA,-- Is what?
20874,L118693,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --"
20875,L118692,u664,m42,ILSA,Rick? Who's he?
20876,L118691,u666,m42,RENAULT,He came from Paris with Rick.
20877,L118690,u664,m42,ILSA,Yes.
20878,L118689,u666,m42,RENAULT,Sam?
20879,L118688,u664,m42,ILSA,"Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him."
20880,L119473,u667,m42,RICK,Here it is.
20881,L119472,u665,m42,LASZLO,I understand.
20882,L119469,u667,m42,RICK,"But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?"
20883,L119468,u665,m42,LASZLO,Yes.
20884,L119467,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me."
20885,L119466,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything."
20886,L119465,u667,m42,RICK,All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
20887,L119464,u665,m42,LASZLO,Everything in order?
20888,L119416,u667,m42,RICK,"Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank."
20889,L119415,u665,m42,LASZLO,No. It's all arranged.
20890,L119414,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?"
20891,L119413,u665,m42,LASZLO,But we made a deal.
20892,L119412,u667,m42,RICK,Keep it. You'll need it in America.
20893,L119411,u665,m42,LASZLO,"I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine."
20894,L119410,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do."
20895,L119409,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you."
20896,L119344,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being."
20897,L119343,u667,m42,RICK,You love her that much?
20898,L119342,u665,m42,LASZLO,"I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca."
20899,L119341,u667,m42,RICK,You seem to know all about my destiny.
20900,L119340,u665,m42,LASZLO,I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
20901,L119339,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, I get the point."
20902,L119338,u665,m42,LASZLO,"You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil."
20903,L119337,u667,m42,RICK,What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
20904,L119336,u665,m42,LASZLO,"We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die."
20905,L119335,u667,m42,RICK,Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
20906,L119334,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Yes, rather."
20907,L119333,u667,m42,RICK,"Had a close one, eh?"
20908,L119332,u665,m42,LASZLO,Thank you.
20909,L119331,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, this might come in handy."
20910,L119203,u665,m42,LASZLO,My wife?
20911,L119202,u667,m42,RICK,"I said, ask your wife."
20912,L119201,u665,m42,LASZLO,I beg your pardon?
20913,L119200,u667,m42,RICK,There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
20914,L119199,u665,m42,LASZLO,There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
20915,L119198,u667,m42,RICK,"My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same."
20916,L119197,u665,m42,LASZLO,I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
20917,L119196,u667,m42,RICK,"I appreciate it, but I don't accept it."
20918,L119195,u665,m42,LASZLO,Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
20919,L119194,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman."
20920,L119193,u665,m42,LASZLO,Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
20921,L119192,u667,m42,RICK,What of it?
20922,L119191,u665,m42,LASZLO,My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
20923,L119190,u667,m42,RICK,I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
20924,L119189,u665,m42,LASZLO,"You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work."
20925,L119188,u665,m42,LASZLO,Right.
20926,L119187,u667,m42,RICK,My office.
20927,L119186,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say."
20928,L119185,u667,m42,RICK,Go ahead.
20929,L119184,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?"
20930,L119146,u667,m42,RICK,"I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days."
20931,L119145,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Good evening. You see, here we are again."
20932,L119144,u667,m42,RICK,Good evening.
20933,L118987,u667,m42,RICK,Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
20934,L118986,u665,m42,LASZLO,Good morning.
20935,L118795,u667,m42,RICK,Any time.
20936,L118794,u665,m42,LASZLO,We'll come again.
20937,L118790,u667,m42,RICK,Not at all.
20938,L118789,u665,m42,LASZLO,I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
20939,L118777,u667,m42,RICK,We all try. You succeed.
20940,L118776,u665,m42,LASZLO,Thank you. I try.
20941,L118775,u667,m42,RICK,Your work.
20942,L118774,u665,m42,LASZLO,What for?
20943,L118773,u667,m42,RICK,And I congratulate you.
20944,L118768,u665,m42,LASZLO,Won't you join us for a drink?
20945,L118767,u667,m42,RICK,And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
20946,L118766,u665,m42,LASZLO,One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
20947,L118765,u667,m42,RICK,How do you do?
20948,L118764,u665,m42,LASZLO,How do you do?
20949,L118952,u665,m42,LASZLO,Are you quite finished with us?
20950,L118951,u666,m42,RENAULT,I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
20951,L118948,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?"
20952,L118947,u666,m42,RENAULT,I believe you have a message for him?
20953,L118946,u665,m42,LASZLO,Yes.
20954,L118945,u666,m42,RENAULT,"By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte."
20955,L118944,u665,m42,LASZLO,-- Thank you.
20956,L118943,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --"
20957,L118937,u665,m42,LASZLO,I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
20958,L118936,u666,m42,RENAULT,And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
20959,L118927,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca."
20960,L118926,u666,m42,RENAULT,"I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur."
20961,L118922,u665,m42,LASZLO,Thank you.
20962,L118921,u666,m42,RENAULT,With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
20963,L118920,u665,m42,LASZLO,May we proceed with the business?
20964,L118919,u666,m42,RENAULT,That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
20965,L118918,u665,m42,LASZLO,I slept very well.
20966,L118917,u666,m42,RENAULT,I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
20967,L118807,u666,m42,RENAULT,Goodnight.
20968,L118806,u665,m42,LASZLO,We'll be there.
20969,L118805,u666,m42,RENAULT,Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
20970,L118788,u666,m42,RENAULT,So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
20971,L118787,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late."
20972,L118786,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle."
20973,L118772,u665,m42,LASZLO,This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
20974,L118771,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!"
20975,L118733,u666,m42,RENAULT,"No. Two champagne cocktails, please."
20976,L118732,u665,m42,LASZLO,My bill.
20977,L118706,u665,m42,LASZLO,Very well.
20978,L118705,u666,m42,RENAULT,Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
20979,L118687,u666,m42,RENAULT,"No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient."
20980,L118686,u665,m42,LASZLO,"No, Captain, please."
20981,L118681,u666,m42,RENAULT,I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
20982,L118680,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?"
20983,L118679,u666,m42,RENAULT,Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
20984,L118678,u665,m42,LASZLO,Yes. What is it you want?
20985,L118677,u666,m42,RENAULT,"I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police."
20986,L118676,u665,m42,LASZLO,Yes.
20987,L118675,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?"
20988,L118954,u665,m42,LASZLO,Good day.
20989,L118953,u669,m42,STRASSER,For the time being.
20990,L118942,u665,m42,LASZLO,You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
20991,L118941,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape."
20992,L118940,u665,m42,LASZLO,"And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast."
20993,L118939,u665,m42,LASZLO,"If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more ""persuasive methods"" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now."
20994,L118938,u669,m42,STRASSER,You will give us the names?
20995,L118935,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning."
20996,L118934,u665,m42,LASZLO,Even in Berlin.
20997,L118933,u669,m42,STRASSER,"You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens."
20998,L118932,u665,m42,LASZLO,And that is?
20999,L118931,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition."
21000,L118930,u665,m42,LASZLO,Is that all you wish to tell us?
21001,L118925,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?"
21002,L118924,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical."
21003,L118923,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca."
21004,L118704,u665,m42,LASZLO,"Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?"
21005,L118703,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle."
21006,L118702,u665,m42,LASZLO,This is hardly the time or the place.
21007,L118701,u669,m42,STRASSER,I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
21008,L118700,u665,m42,LASZLO,"I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil."
21009,L118699,u669,m42,STRASSER,You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
21010,L118698,u665,m42,LASZLO,"I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian."
21011,L119488,u666,m42,RENAULT,Ask Monsieur Rick.
21012,L119487,u669,m42,STRASSER,Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
21013,L119486,u666,m42,RENAULT,Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
21014,L119485,u669,m42,STRASSER,What is the meaning of that phone call?
21015,L119212,u669,m42,STRASSER,Find one.
21016,L119211,u666,m42,RENAULT,But I have no excuse to close it.
21017,L119210,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed."
21018,L119209,u666,m42,RENAULT,But everybody's having such a good time.
21019,L119208,u669,m42,STRASSER,"You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once."
21020,L119086,u666,m42,RENAULT,I see what you mean.
21021,L119085,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay."
21022,L119084,u666,m42,RENAULT,"A leader, like Laszlo?"
21023,L119083,u669,m42,STRASSER,"We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader."
21024,L119081,u669,m42,STRASSER,And if it should change?
21025,L119080,u666,m42,RENAULT,"I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy."
21026,L119079,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?"
21027,L119078,u666,m42,RENAULT,"My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people."
21028,L119077,u669,m42,STRASSER,"You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe."
21029,L118915,u666,m42,RENAULT,It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
21030,L118914,u669,m42,STRASSER,"As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day."
21031,L118913,u666,m42,RENAULT,"But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they ""blundered"" into Berlin in 1918."
21032,L118912,u669,m42,STRASSER,You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
21033,L118911,u666,m42,RENAULT,"If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there."
21034,L118910,u669,m42,STRASSER,I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
21035,L118708,u669,m42,STRASSER,Mademoiselle.
21036,L118707,u666,m42,RENAULT,Mademoiselle.
21037,L118653,u669,m42,STRASSER,Perhaps.
21038,L118652,u666,m42,RENAULT,"You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick."
21039,L118649,u669,m42,STRASSER,I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
21040,L118648,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Of course, one must admit he has great courage."
21041,L118638,u669,m42,STRASSER,You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
21042,L118637,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too."
21043,L118633,u669,m42,STRASSER,How about New York?
21044,L118632,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Ho, diplomatist!"
21045,L118620,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course."
21046,L118619,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes."
21047,L118618,u669,m42,STRASSER,"You repeat ""Third Reich"" as though you expected there to be others."
21048,L118613,u669,m42,STRASSER,"How do you do, Mr. Rick?"
21049,L118612,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich."
21050,L118594,u669,m42,STRASSER,"I expected no less, Captain."
21051,L118593,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers."
21052,L118590,u669,m42,STRASSER,Thank you.
21053,L118589,u666,m42,RENAULT,"May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine."
21054,L118588,u669,m42,STRASSER,Champagne and a tin of caviar.
21055,L118587,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major."
21056,L118585,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Good evening, Captain."
21057,L118584,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Good evening, gentlemen."
21058,L118397,u669,m42,STRASSER,"I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself."
21059,L118396,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's."
21060,L118393,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects."
21061,L118392,u669,m42,STRASSER,"By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?"
21062,L118391,u666,m42,RENAULT,"What else, my dear Major?"
21063,L118390,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather."
21064,L118389,u666,m42,RENAULT,"You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major."
21065,L118386,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle."
21066,L118385,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here."
21067,L118384,u666,m42,RENAULT,Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
21068,L119508,u667,m42,RICK,"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
21069,L119507,u666,m42,RENAULT,Uh huh.
21070,L119506,u667,m42,RICK,Our expenses?
21071,L119505,u666,m42,RENAULT,And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
21072,L119504,u667,m42,RICK,My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
21073,L119503,u666,m42,RENAULT,It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
21074,L119502,u666,m42,RENAULT,I think perhaps you're right.
21075,L119501,u667,m42,RICK,"Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start."
21076,L119500,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot."
21077,L119484,u667,m42,RICK,"As soon as the plane goes, Louis."
21078,L119483,u666,m42,RENAULT,"I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course."
21079,L119482,u667,m42,RICK,"Anyway, thanks for helping me out."
21080,L119481,u666,m42,RENAULT,"What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying."
21081,L119480,u667,m42,RICK,Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
21082,L119479,u666,m42,RENAULT,Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
21083,L119445,u667,m42,RICK,And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
21084,L119444,u666,m42,RENAULT,"You think of everything, don't you?"
21085,L119443,u667,m42,RICK,"If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official."
21086,L119433,u666,m42,RENAULT,That is my least vulnerable spot.
21087,L119432,u667,m42,RICK,"Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart."
21088,L119431,u666,m42,RENAULT,Call off your watch-dogs you said.
21089,L119430,u667,m42,RICK,I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
21090,L119429,u666,m42,RENAULT,"I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?"
21091,L119425,u666,m42,RENAULT,Put that gun down.
21092,L119424,u667,m42,RICK,I have. Sit down over there.
21093,L119423,u666,m42,RENAULT,Have you taken leave of your senses?
21094,L119422,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet."
21095,L119399,u666,m42,RENAULT,Serves me right for not being musical.
21096,L119398,u667,m42,RICK,Sam's piano.
21097,L119397,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?"
21098,L119396,u667,m42,RICK,I have the letters right here.
21099,L119395,u666,m42,RENAULT,Is everything ready?
21100,L119394,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette."
21101,L119393,u666,m42,RENAULT,"You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky."
21102,L119392,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Oh, he won't be followed here."
21103,L119391,u667,m42,RICK,I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
21104,L119390,u666,m42,RENAULT,"I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time."
21105,L119389,u667,m42,RICK,You're late.
21106,L119376,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Go ahead, Ricky."
21107,L119375,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, thanks."
21108,L119374,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I."
21109,L119373,u667,m42,RICK,I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
21110,L119372,u666,m42,RENAULT,I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
21111,L119371,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, she isn't just any woman."
21112,L119370,u666,m42,RENAULT,"There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman."
21113,L119369,u667,m42,RICK,"I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance."
21114,L119368,u667,m42,RICK,Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
21115,L119367,u666,m42,RENAULT,It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
21116,L119366,u667,m42,RICK,"Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?"
21117,L119363,u666,m42,RENAULT,You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
21118,L119362,u667,m42,RICK,Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
21119,L119361,u666,m42,RENAULT,What friend?
21120,L119360,u667,m42,RICK,And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
21121,L119359,u666,m42,RENAULT,Huh?
21122,L119358,u667,m42,RICK,"You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane."
21123,L119357,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs."
21124,L119356,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, they're all excellent reasons."
21125,L119355,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either."
21126,L119354,u667,m42,RICK,-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
21127,L119353,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --"
21128,L119352,u667,m42,RICK,"But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now."
21129,L119215,u666,m42,RENAULT,"I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!"
21130,L119214,u667,m42,RICK,How can you close me up? On what grounds?
21131,L119183,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!"
21132,L119182,u667,m42,RICK,Put it down as a gesture to love.
21133,L119181,u666,m42,RENAULT,Why do you interfere with my little romances?
21134,L119180,u667,m42,RICK,Yeah? Why?
21135,L119179,u666,m42,RENAULT,"As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist."
21136,L119062,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick."
21137,L119061,u667,m42,RICK,So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
21138,L119060,u666,m42,RENAULT,Huh?
21139,L119059,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, it looks like you're a little late."
21140,L119058,u666,m42,RENAULT,Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
21141,L119057,u667,m42,RICK,"Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?"
21142,L119056,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?"
21143,L119055,u667,m42,RICK,That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
21144,L119054,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman."
21145,L118793,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night."
21146,L118792,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, it's my party."
21147,L118770,u667,m42,RICK,-- Thanks. I will.
21148,L118769,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Oh, no, Rick never --"
21149,L118759,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Hello, Ilsa."
21150,L118758,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --"
21151,L118625,u667,m42,RICK,I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
21152,L118624,u666,m42,RENAULT,That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
21153,L118615,u666,m42,RENAULT,And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
21154,L118614,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, how do you do?"
21155,L118579,u666,m42,RENAULT,Excuse me.
21156,L118578,u667,m42,RICK,"Yeah, you were saying?"
21157,L118575,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, I see. Gestapo spank."
21158,L118574,u666,m42,RENAULT,I have my orders.
21159,L118573,u667,m42,RICK,"Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here."
21160,L118572,u666,m42,RENAULT,The winning side would have paid you much better.
21161,L118571,u667,m42,RICK,And got well paid for it on both occasions.
21162,L118570,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side."
21163,L118569,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist."
21164,L118568,u667,m42,RICK,"Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?"
21165,L118567,u666,m42,RENAULT,It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
21166,L118566,u667,m42,RICK,Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
21167,L118565,u666,m42,RENAULT,"I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca."
21168,L118564,u667,m42,RICK,He'll take one.
21169,L118563,u666,m42,RENAULT,He is traveling with a lady.
21170,L118562,u667,m42,RICK,Why two?
21171,L118561,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two."
21172,L118560,u667,m42,RICK,Okay.
21173,L118559,u666,m42,RENAULT,Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
21174,L118558,u667,m42,RICK,I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
21175,L118557,u666,m42,RENAULT,Is that a serious offer?
21176,L118556,u667,m42,RICK,Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
21177,L118555,u666,m42,RENAULT,This is the end of the chase.
21178,L118554,u667,m42,RICK,-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
21179,L118553,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Oh, but I just told you. --"
21180,L118552,u667,m42,RICK,His escape.
21181,L118551,u666,m42,RENAULT,Manages what?
21182,L118550,u667,m42,RICK,It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
21183,L118549,u666,m42,RENAULT,"It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca."
21184,L118548,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world."
21185,L118547,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed."
21186,L118546,u667,m42,RICK,Victor Laszlo?
21187,L118545,u666,m42,RENAULT,Victor Laszlo.
21188,L118544,u667,m42,RICK,Yeah? What's his name?
21189,L118543,u666,m42,RENAULT,That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
21190,L118542,u667,m42,RICK,I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
21191,L118541,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open."
21192,L118540,u667,m42,RICK,Yeah? Have a brandy?
21193,L118539,u666,m42,RENAULT,"How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice."
21194,L118534,u666,m42,RENAULT,Perhaps not.
21195,L118533,u667,m42,RICK,I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
21196,L118531,u667,m42,RICK,Our entertainment is enough.
21197,L118530,u666,m42,RENAULT,"You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers."
21198,L118529,u666,m42,RENAULT,A wise foreign policy.
21199,L118528,u667,m42,RICK,I stick my neck out for nobody.
21200,L118527,u666,m42,RENAULT,"If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape."
21201,L118526,u666,m42,RENAULT,"This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less."
21202,L118525,u667,m42,RICK,"What, again?"
21203,L118524,u666,m42,RENAULT,"Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe."
21204,L118518,u666,m42,RENAULT,Huh!
21205,L118517,u667,m42,RICK,I was misinformed.
21206,L118516,u666,m42,RENAULT,Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
21207,L118515,u667,m42,RICK,My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
21208,L118514,u666,m42,RENAULT,And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
21209,L118513,u667,m42,RICK,It was a combination of all three.
21210,L118511,u666,m42,RENAULT,The clipper to America.
21211,L118510,u667,m42,RICK,Why? What's in Lisbon?
21212,L118509,u666,m42,RENAULT,The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
21213,L118507,u667,m42,RICK,"When it comes to women, you're a true democrat."
21214,L118506,u666,m42,RENAULT,"You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?"
21215,L118505,u666,m42,RENAULT,"How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce."
21216,L118504,u667,m42,RICK,"Hello, Louis."
21217,L118495,u672,m42,YVONNE,Take your hands off me!
21218,L118494,u667,m42,RICK,"Come on, we're going to get your coat."
21219,L118492,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Sacha, call a cab."
21220,L118491,u672,m42,YVONNE,"Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --"
21221,L118489,u672,m42,YVONNE,"Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up."
21222,L118488,u667,m42,RICK,"Sacha, she's had enough."
21223,L118487,u672,m42,YVONNE,Give me another.
21224,L118486,u667,m42,RICK,I never make plans that far ahead.
21225,L118485,u672,m42,YVONNE,Will I see you tonight?
21226,L118484,u667,m42,RICK,"That's so long ago, I don't remember."
21227,L118483,u672,m42,YVONNE,Where were you last night?
21228,L119495,u667,m42,RICK,Put it down!
21229,L119494,u669,m42,STRASSER,Get me the Radio Tower!
21230,L119493,u667,m42,RICK,Put that phone down!
21231,L119492,u669,m42,STRASSER,Hello?
21232,L119491,u667,m42,RICK,"I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you."
21233,L119490,u669,m42,STRASSER,I would advise you not to interfere.
21234,L118651,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Good evening, Mr. Blaine."
21235,L118650,u667,m42,RICK,"You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon."
21236,L118647,u669,m42,STRASSER,"Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar."
21237,L118646,u667,m42,RICK,"Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too."
21238,L118645,u669,m42,STRASSER,"In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?"
21239,L118644,u667,m42,RICK,My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
21240,L118643,u669,m42,STRASSER,"You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us."
21241,L118642,u667,m42,RICK,Are my eyes really brown?
21242,L118636,u667,m42,RICK,I haven't the slightest idea.
21243,L118635,u669,m42,STRASSER,Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
21244,L118634,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade."
21245,L118629,u667,m42,RICK,It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
21246,L118628,u669,m42,STRASSER,Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
21247,L118627,u667,m42,RICK,There seems to be no secret about that.
21248,L118626,u669,m42,STRASSER,I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
21249,L118623,u667,m42,RICK,I'm a drunkard.
21250,L118622,u669,m42,STRASSER,What is your nationality?
21251,L118621,u667,m42,RICK,"Make it official, if you like."
21252,L118604,u671,m42,UGARTE,"Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!"
21253,L118603,u667,m42,RICK,Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
21254,L118602,u671,m42,UGARTE,"Rick! Rick, help me!"
21255,L118453,u671,m42,UGARTE,Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
21256,L118452,u667,m42,RICK,I don't want them here overnight.
21257,L118451,u671,m42,UGARTE,"Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer."
21258,L118450,u667,m42,RICK,For how long?
21259,L118449,u671,m42,UGARTE,"One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please."
21260,L118447,u671,m42,UGARTE,Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
21261,L118446,u667,m42,RICK,Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
21262,L118445,u671,m42,UGARTE,"Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca."
21263,L118444,u667,m42,RICK,I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
21264,L118443,u671,m42,UGARTE,But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
21265,L118442,u667,m42,RICK,"For a price, Ugarte, for a price."
21266,L118441,u671,m42,UGARTE,"But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas."
21267,L118440,u667,m42,RICK,"If I gave you any thought, I probably would."
21268,L118439,u671,m42,UGARTE,"I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?"
21269,L118438,u667,m42,RICK,No.
21270,L118437,u671,m42,UGARTE,Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
21271,L118435,u671,m42,UGARTE,"You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so."
21272,L118434,u667,m42,RICK,They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
21273,L118433,u671,m42,UGARTE,"May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?"
21274,L118431,u667,m42,RICK,-- You thought what?
21275,L118430,u671,m42,UGARTE,"Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --"
21276,L118429,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, what makes you think I haven't?"
21277,L118428,u671,m42,UGARTE,"Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life."
21278,L118423,u667,m42,RICK,Hello Ugarte.
21279,L118422,u671,m42,UGARTE,"Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick."
21280,L118890,u668,m42,SAM,"No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her."
21281,L118889,u667,m42,RICK,Where is she? Have you seen her?
21282,L118873,u668,m42,SAM,"The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head."
21283,L118872,u667,m42,RICK,And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
21284,L118863,u667,m42,RICK,"You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid."
21285,L118862,u668,m42,SAM,"This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?"
21286,L118843,u668,m42,SAM,"Yes, boss."
21287,L118842,u667,m42,RICK,"If she can stand it, I can. Play it!"
21288,L118841,u668,m42,SAM,"Well, I don't think I can remember it."
21289,L118840,u667,m42,RICK,You played it for her and you can play it for me.
21290,L118839,u668,m42,SAM,"No, I don't."
21291,L118838,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear."
21292,L118837,u668,m42,SAM,Just a little something of my own.
21293,L118836,u667,m42,RICK,What's that you're playing?
21294,L118834,u667,m42,RICK,I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
21295,L118833,u668,m42,SAM,"Uh, my watch stopped."
21296,L118832,u667,m42,RICK,"Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?"
21297,L118831,u668,m42,SAM,"Yeah, boss?"
21298,L118830,u667,m42,RICK,"They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?"
21299,L118829,u668,m42,SAM,"No, sir. I'm staying right here."
21300,L118828,u667,m42,RICK,"Shut up and go home, will you?"
21301,L118827,u668,m42,SAM,We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
21302,L118826,u667,m42,RICK,She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
21303,L118825,u668,m42,SAM,"Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here."
21304,L118824,u667,m42,RICK,"No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady."
21305,L118823,u668,m42,SAM,"Boss, let's get out of here."
21306,L118822,u667,m42,RICK,Then don't have a drink.
21307,L118821,u668,m42,SAM,"No. Not me, boss."
21308,L118820,u667,m42,RICK,Good. Then have a drink.
21309,L118819,u668,m42,SAM,"Well, I ain't sleepy either."
21310,L118818,u667,m42,RICK,No.
21311,L118817,u668,m42,SAM,You ever going to bed?
21312,L118816,u667,m42,RICK,No.
21313,L118815,u668,m42,SAM,Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
21314,L118814,u667,m42,RICK,Not right now.
21315,L118813,u668,m42,SAM,"Boss, ain't you going to bed?"
21316,L118812,u667,m42,RICK,Yeah?
21317,L118811,u668,m42,SAM,Boss!
21318,L118478,u667,m42,RICK,Sorry.
21319,L118477,u668,m42,SAM,"Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here."
21320,L118476,u667,m42,RICK,He'll double what I pay you.
21321,L118475,u668,m42,SAM,I like it fine here.
21322,L118474,u667,m42,RICK,"Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot."
21323,L122054,u676,m43,CHUCK,The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
21324,L122053,u673,m43,ALEKSEI,Nobody remembers that.
21325,L122052,u676,m43,CHUCK,Worse than Warsaw.
21326,L122051,u673,m43,ALEKSEI,It's bad.
21327,L122041,u676,m43,CHUCK,So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
21328,L122040,u673,m43,ALEKSEI,Six kilometers.  Four miles.
21329,L122039,u676,m43,CHUCK,"It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --"
21330,L122553,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
21331,L122552,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,You can't make it.
21332,L122549,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Then we've just got shit.
21333,L122548,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have."
21334,L122547,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
21335,L122545,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see?
21336,L122544,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Nothing out there but ocean.
21337,L122543,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,It's real.
21338,L122542,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage."
21339,L122541,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Jesus.
21340,L122540,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,You are.
21341,L122539,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,What's so damn funny?
21342,L122535,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Shut up.
21343,L122534,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot."
21344,L122533,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn."
21345,L122532,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,I float.  You sink.  End of story.
21346,L122530,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
21347,L122529,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you."
21348,L122528,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,They're on autopilot.
21349,L122527,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
21350,L122513,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
21351,L122512,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
21352,L122505,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Thank you for fucking up my life.
21353,L122504,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God."
21354,L122494,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"Yeah, sure, what?"
21355,L122493,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse."
21356,L122492,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door..."
21357,L122491,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Die tomorrow or die today.
21358,L122490,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
21359,L122489,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
21360,L122488,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
21361,L122487,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"The sea is lovely, dark and deep."
21362,L122486,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,You quitter you quitter you quitter.
21363,L122485,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep."
21364,L122484,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,No!
21365,L122483,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,I'm lost.  Goodbye.
21366,L122465,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
21367,L122464,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Why do they have to die for me?
21368,L122463,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die."
21369,L122462,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
21370,L122461,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,What are you doing?
21371,L122457,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft."
21372,L122456,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,You're beautiful.  Marry me.
21373,L122453,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Water water water --
21374,L122452,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Fix raft first.
21375,L122451,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Get water!
21376,L122448,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,I'm putting it off.
21377,L122447,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,You're putting off the inevitable.
21378,L122446,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Moon's too bright.
21379,L122445,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
21380,L122444,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south."
21381,L122443,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"Survive today, that's the point."
21382,L122442,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"If they can't see you, what's the point?"
21383,L122439,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water."
21384,L122438,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,No.
21385,L122437,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"Take it, damn it."
21386,L122436,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,No.
21387,L122435,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Take it.
21388,L122434,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"No more water, you said."
21389,L122432,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Going to die anyway.
21390,L122431,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Do too little you'll die.
21391,L122430,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"Do too much, I'll die."
21392,L122429,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more."
21393,L122428,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"No water, no work."
21394,L122427,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it."
21395,L122426,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Thirsty.
21396,L122425,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,You've had today's water.
21397,L122424,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Can't.  Need water.
21398,L122423,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"Get up, damn you."
21399,L122422,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Feels so good to lie here.
21400,L122421,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Get up.
21401,L122418,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,"With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown."
21402,L122417,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,"Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope."
21403,L122416,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
21404,L122415,u674,m43,BADCHUCK,Catch another fish tomorrow.
21405,L122414,u681,m43,GOODCHUCK,Save some for tomorrow.
21406,L122791,u676,m43,CHUCK,Sure.
21407,L122790,u675,m43,BETTINA,Keep painting.  Promise me.
21408,L122783,u675,m43,BETTINA,"Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch."
21409,L122782,u676,m43,CHUCK,No.  that was the last one.
21410,L122781,u675,m43,BETTINA,Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
21411,L122780,u676,m43,CHUCK,To tell you the truth -- you did.
21412,L122779,u675,m43,BETTINA,You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
21413,L122778,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Well, not really, I --"
21414,L122777,u675,m43,BETTINA,I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
21415,L122775,u675,m43,BETTINA,"He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him."
21416,L122774,u676,m43,CHUCK,Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
21417,L122773,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Well, I do a little drawing --"
21418,L122772,u675,m43,BETTINA,Oh?  You've tried?
21419,L122771,u676,m43,CHUCK,They're harder to do than they look.
21420,L122770,u675,m43,BETTINA,Yeah.  A long time ago.
21421,L122769,u676,m43,CHUCK,Possible.  So you did those wings?
21422,L122768,u675,m43,BETTINA,Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
21423,L122765,u676,m43,CHUCK,Okay.  Sure.
21424,L122764,u675,m43,BETTINA,Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
21425,L122763,u676,m43,CHUCK,As much as anybody.
21426,L122762,u675,m43,BETTINA,You know what happened to this?
21427,L122761,u676,m43,CHUCK,No.
21428,L122760,u675,m43,BETTINA,"Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up."
21429,L122759,u676,m43,CHUCK,There was an unavoidable delay.
21430,L122758,u675,m43,BETTINA,You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
21431,L122816,u676,m43,CHUCK,So do I.
21432,L122815,u680,m43,ERICA,I've got lots of time.
21433,L122814,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Yeah, a long one."
21434,L122813,u680,m43,ERICA,Must be a story there.
21435,L122812,u676,m43,CHUCK,I had it on the island with me.
21436,L122811,u680,m43,ERICA,You?  Personally?
21437,L122810,u676,m43,CHUCK,Had a package to deliver.
21438,L122809,u680,m43,ERICA,What brings you out to the sticks?
21439,L122806,u676,m43,CHUCK,"I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled."
21440,L122805,u680,m43,ERICA,"Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?"
21441,L122674,u682,m43,KELLY,I'm so glad you're alive.
21442,L122673,u676,m43,CHUCK,You too.
21443,L122672,u682,m43,KELLY,"I love you, Chuck."
21444,L122671,u682,m43,KELLY,I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
21445,L122670,u676,m43,CHUCK,It means a lot...that you came.
21446,L122669,u682,m43,KELLY,I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
21447,L122668,u676,m43,CHUCK,I don't know.  I really don't know.
21448,L122667,u682,m43,KELLY,What will you do?
21449,L122666,u676,m43,CHUCK,Great.  Really.
21450,L122665,u682,m43,KELLY,You okay?
21451,L122664,u676,m43,CHUCK,That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
21452,L122663,u682,m43,KELLY,This is so unfair.
21453,L122661,u676,m43,CHUCK,I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
21454,L122660,u682,m43,KELLY,You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
21455,L122659,u676,m43,CHUCK,Not when you have no choice.
21456,L122658,u682,m43,KELLY,"So simple to say, so hard to do."
21457,L122657,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last."
21458,L122656,u682,m43,KELLY,Come on.  Try.
21459,L122655,u682,m43,KELLY,Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
21460,L122654,u676,m43,CHUCK,"The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived."
21461,L122653,u682,m43,KELLY,Yeah?
21462,L122652,u676,m43,CHUCK,"The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am."
21463,L122651,u682,m43,KELLY,Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
21464,L122650,u676,m43,CHUCK,That about sums it up.
21465,L122649,u682,m43,KELLY,"Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted."
21466,L122648,u676,m43,CHUCK,What was inside?
21467,L122647,u682,m43,KELLY,"Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing."
21468,L122646,u676,m43,CHUCK,There was a coffin?
21469,L122642,u676,m43,CHUCK,My epitaph.
21470,L122641,u682,m43,KELLY,"What's that, written on the sail?"
21471,L122640,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Yeah, well...couldn't be helped."
21472,L122639,u682,m43,KELLY,"All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me."
21473,L122636,u676,m43,CHUCK,"That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day."
21474,L122635,u682,m43,KELLY,What's that?
21475,L122625,u682,m43,KELLY,"No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?"
21476,L122624,u676,m43,CHUCK,Is that Jango?
21477,L122623,u682,m43,KELLY,Her name's Hannah.
21478,L122621,u676,m43,CHUCK,You have any children?
21479,L122620,u682,m43,KELLY,I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
21480,L122619,u676,m43,CHUCK,I would have done the same thing.
21481,L122618,u682,m43,KELLY,If I'd known you were alive --
21482,L122617,u676,m43,CHUCK,I know.
21483,L122616,u682,m43,KELLY,I would never --
21484,L122615,u676,m43,CHUCK,I thought you might have.
21485,L122614,u682,m43,KELLY,I got married.
21486,L122612,u676,m43,CHUCK,A few things came up.  Or went down.
21487,L122611,u682,m43,KELLY,"Right back, you said you'd be right back."
21488,L122608,u676,m43,CHUCK,Hey...hey...it's okay!
21489,L122607,u682,m43,KELLY,I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
21490,L122302,u682,m43,KELLY,Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
21491,L122301,u676,m43,CHUCK,"A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?"
21492,L122300,u682,m43,KELLY,"Chuck, you're breaking my heart."
21493,L122298,u676,m43,CHUCK,Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
21494,L122297,u682,m43,KELLY,Get back?  From where?
21495,L122296,u682,m43,KELLY,Don't even start.
21496,L122295,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back."
21497,L122294,u682,m43,KELLY,"What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now."
21498,L122293,u676,m43,CHUCK,I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
21499,L122292,u682,m43,KELLY,"Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was."
21500,L122291,u682,m43,KELLY,I burned the Christmas tree.
21501,L122290,u676,m43,CHUCK,"No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --"
21502,L122289,u682,m43,KELLY,I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
21503,L122288,u676,m43,CHUCK,Yes there is.
21504,L122287,u682,m43,KELLY,There isn't any us.
21505,L122286,u676,m43,CHUCK,It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
21506,L122285,u682,m43,KELLY,That's your dog.
21507,L122214,u676,m43,CHUCK,I can't take him to work.
21508,L122213,u682,m43,KELLY,No.
21509,L122212,u676,m43,CHUCK,Could you watch Jango?
21510,L122211,u682,m43,KELLY,"""We're"" not over-reacting."
21511,L122210,u676,m43,CHUCK,"We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting."
21512,L122209,u682,m43,KELLY,This isn't working out.
21513,L122207,u682,m43,KELLY,You want to.
21514,L122206,u676,m43,CHUCK,I have to.
21515,L122205,u682,m43,KELLY,You can't go now.
21516,L122204,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go."
21517,L122203,u676,m43,CHUCK,You did?
21518,L122202,u682,m43,KELLY,A ring.  I wanted a ring.
21519,L122201,u676,m43,CHUCK,I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
21520,L122197,u682,m43,KELLY,For when I travel?
21521,L122196,u676,m43,CHUCK,"You know, for when you travel."
21522,L122194,u676,m43,CHUCK,And for you --
21523,L122193,u682,m43,KELLY,A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
21524,L122192,u676,m43,CHUCK,I can't even keep fish alive.
21525,L122191,u682,m43,KELLY,He's your cute thing.
21526,L122190,u676,m43,CHUCK,He is a cute thing.
21527,L122189,u682,m43,KELLY,"I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --"
21528,L122188,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Hey, look at you."
21529,L122185,u682,m43,KELLY,"Let me guess, Russia came up?"
21530,L122184,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better."
21531,L122183,u682,m43,KELLY,You don't seem too happy about it.
21532,L122182,u676,m43,CHUCK,Four four.  A record.
21533,L122180,u676,m43,CHUCK,Not if you work for FedEx.
21534,L122179,u682,m43,KELLY,Merry Christmas eve.
21535,L122154,u682,m43,KELLY,"Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it."
21536,L122153,u676,m43,CHUCK,What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
21537,L122152,u682,m43,KELLY,Chuck.
21538,L122150,u682,m43,KELLY,"Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?"
21539,L122149,u676,m43,CHUCK,Got to follow the paper path here.
21540,L122148,u676,m43,CHUCK,I thought I did.
21541,L122147,u682,m43,KELLY,"Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?"
21542,L122146,u676,m43,CHUCK,Cold.
21543,L122145,u682,m43,KELLY,How was Russia?
21544,L122144,u676,m43,CHUCK,Let's take a look.
21545,L122143,u682,m43,KELLY,"My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed."
21546,L122142,u676,m43,CHUCK,You smell like formaldehyde.
21547,L122141,u682,m43,KELLY,Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
21548,L122139,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you."
21549,L122138,u682,m43,KELLY,Sonofabitch!
21550,L122282,u683,m43,LESLIE,"There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney."
21551,L122281,u676,m43,CHUCK,Anything else?
21552,L122280,u683,m43,LESLIE,The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
21553,L122279,u676,m43,CHUCK,When's the next Jumbo?
21554,L122263,u676,m43,CHUCK,Terrific.  Yours?
21555,L122262,u683,m43,LESLIE,And how was your Christmas?
21556,L122261,u676,m43,CHUCK,I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
21557,L122580,u678,m43,DOCTOR,"Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow."
21558,L122579,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here."
21559,L122577,u676,m43,CHUCK,Not to mention on me.
21560,L122576,u678,m43,DOCTOR,You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
21561,L122575,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Yes, yes he did."
21562,L122574,u678,m43,DOCTOR,Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
21563,L122573,u676,m43,CHUCK,I most definitely say I am.
21564,L122572,u678,m43,DOCTOR,If you say you are.
21565,L122571,u676,m43,CHUCK,But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
21566,L122570,u678,m43,DOCTOR,"Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out."
21567,L122569,u676,m43,CHUCK,I am one lucky guy.
21568,L122568,u678,m43,DOCTOR,"And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy."
21569,L122567,u676,m43,CHUCK,Which I didn't have.
21570,L122566,u678,m43,DOCTOR,Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
21571,L122565,u676,m43,CHUCK,All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
21572,L122564,u678,m43,DOCTOR,Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
21573,L122563,u676,m43,CHUCK,Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
21574,L122560,u678,m43,DOCTOR,"Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely."
21575,L122559,u676,m43,CHUCK,My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
21576,L122801,u676,m43,CHUCK,Yeah.
21577,L122800,u679,m43,DRIVER,You're Chuck Noland.
21578,L122799,u676,m43,CHUCK,Sure.
21579,L122798,u679,m43,DRIVER,"Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup."
21580,L122797,u676,m43,CHUCK,I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
21581,L122796,u676,m43,CHUCK,No.
21582,L122795,u679,m43,DRIVER,"You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?"
21583,L122793,u679,m43,DRIVER,You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
21584,L122792,u676,m43,CHUCK,Need some help?
21585,L122248,u676,m43,CHUCK,Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
21586,L122247,u685,m43,ROGER,Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
21587,L122246,u676,m43,CHUCK,Really?
21588,L122244,u676,m43,CHUCK,"True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know."
21589,L122243,u685,m43,ROGER,"Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry."
21590,L122242,u676,m43,CHUCK,But chickens?
21591,L122228,u676,m43,CHUCK,So did I.
21592,L122227,u685,m43,ROGER,Thought you were going to bring her.
21593,L122224,u685,m43,ROGER,Let's eat.
21594,L122223,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen."
21595,L122753,u676,m43,CHUCK,"The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next."
21596,L122752,u684,m43,MOM,What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
21597,L122749,u684,m43,MOM,This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
21598,L122748,u676,m43,CHUCK,I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
21599,L122745,u676,m43,CHUCK,I wanted to come here.
21600,L122744,u684,m43,MOM,"Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --"
21601,L122743,u676,m43,CHUCK,When'd you start working here?
21602,L122259,u684,m43,MOM,"There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here."
21603,L122258,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me."
21604,L122257,u684,m43,MOM,I'm doing fine.
21605,L122256,u676,m43,CHUCK,The place is falling apart.
21606,L122255,u684,m43,MOM,Don't you even think about it.
21607,L122254,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here..."
21608,L122253,u684,m43,MOM,"Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought."
21609,L122252,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream."
21610,L122236,u684,m43,MOM,"That new roof, that's your doing."
21611,L122235,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?"
21612,L122230,u676,m43,CHUCK,"It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me."
21613,L122229,u684,m43,MOM,It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
21614,L122220,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Mom, meet Jango."
21615,L122219,u684,m43,MOM,What happened to your pants?
21616,L122733,u687,m43,TECHNICIAN,"You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it."
21617,L122732,u676,m43,CHUCK,Can you find her?
21618,L122731,u687,m43,TECHNICIAN,"Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account."
21619,L122730,u687,m43,TECHNICIAN,"Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check."
21620,L122729,u676,m43,CHUCK,What about the sender?
21621,L122728,u687,m43,TECHNICIAN,"Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L."
21622,L122270,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?"
21623,L122269,u687,m43,TECHNICIAN,Trying.
21624,L122276,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?"
21625,L122275,u688,m43,VOICE,Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
21626,L122274,u676,m43,CHUCK,What's going on down there?
21627,L122273,u688,m43,VOICE,"It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter."
21628,L122272,u676,m43,CHUCK,Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
21629,L122271,u688,m43,VOICE,Kamal is not here.
21630,L122737,u686,m43,STAN,No sweat.
21631,L122736,u676,m43,CHUCK,Thanks.  For everything.
21632,L122726,u686,m43,STAN,"Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you."
21633,L122725,u676,m43,CHUCK,I need to do it.
21634,L122724,u686,m43,STAN,"You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do."
21635,L122723,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno."
21636,L122722,u686,m43,STAN,"What, then?"
21637,L122720,u686,m43,STAN,"Deep, real deep."
21638,L122719,u676,m43,CHUCK,Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
21639,L122718,u686,m43,STAN,Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
21640,L122717,u676,m43,CHUCK,That's what it's about.
21641,L122716,u686,m43,STAN,What?
21642,L122715,u676,m43,CHUCK,Take your time.
21643,L122713,u676,m43,CHUCK,Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
21644,L122712,u686,m43,STAN,Digital laser readers.
21645,L122691,u676,m43,CHUCK,Believe me I know.
21646,L122690,u686,m43,STAN,That's all there is.
21647,L122689,u676,m43,CHUCK,To life.
21648,L122688,u686,m43,STAN,To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
21649,L122686,u676,m43,CHUCK,What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
21650,L122685,u686,m43,STAN,"I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon..."
21651,L122684,u676,m43,CHUCK,Hallelujah.
21652,L122683,u686,m43,STAN,"You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!"
21653,L122681,u676,m43,CHUCK,To Wilson.
21654,L122680,u686,m43,STAN,To Wilson.
21655,L122677,u676,m43,CHUCK,"I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing."
21656,L122676,u686,m43,STAN,"When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles."
21657,L122638,u676,m43,CHUCK,Forty-three days.
21658,L122637,u686,m43,STAN,You were how long on this?
21659,L122634,u676,m43,CHUCK,Time I had lots of.
21660,L122633,u686,m43,STAN,Must have taken a hell of a long time.
21661,L122632,u676,m43,CHUCK,I braided them.
21662,L122631,u686,m43,STAN,Cool ropes.
21663,L122630,u676,m43,CHUCK,You should have smelled me.
21664,L122629,u686,m43,STAN,This stinks really bad.
21665,L122628,u676,m43,CHUCK,Want to see my raft?
21666,L122627,u686,m43,STAN,How about we go somewhere else?
21667,L122602,u676,m43,CHUCK,This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
21668,L122601,u686,m43,STAN,Hello.
21669,L122599,u686,m43,STAN,"You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!"
21670,L122598,u676,m43,CHUCK,I beat the odds!
21671,L122590,u676,m43,CHUCK,"I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker."
21672,L122589,u686,m43,STAN,You're fucking dead!
21673,L122588,u676,m43,CHUCK,It's me.
21674,L122587,u686,m43,STAN,"God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!"
21675,L122584,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland..."
21676,L122583,u686,m43,STAN,Hello?
21677,L122266,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia."
21678,L122265,u686,m43,STAN,Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
21679,L122128,u686,m43,STAN,We're on.
21680,L122127,u676,m43,CHUCK,Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
21681,L122126,u686,m43,STAN,Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
21682,L122125,u676,m43,CHUCK,A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
21683,L122123,u676,m43,CHUCK,"This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal."
21684,L122122,u686,m43,STAN,"I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --"
21685,L122121,u676,m43,CHUCK,You are one sick fucker.
21686,L122120,u686,m43,STAN,"Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life."
21687,L122119,u676,m43,CHUCK,For the third time.
21688,L122118,u686,m43,STAN,That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
21689,L122117,u676,m43,CHUCK,That's why you're a gambling man.
21690,L122116,u686,m43,STAN,"We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice."
21691,L122115,u676,m43,CHUCK,I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
21692,L122114,u686,m43,STAN,"You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go."
21693,L122113,u676,m43,CHUCK,Forget it.
21694,L122112,u686,m43,STAN,"Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis."
21695,L122111,u676,m43,CHUCK,And never take.
21696,L122110,u686,m43,STAN,For all those vacation days you got coming.
21697,L122109,u676,m43,CHUCK,It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
21698,L122108,u686,m43,STAN,I didn't know we had sailboats.
21699,L122107,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Baloney.  I do see the damn ""big picture."""
21700,L122106,u686,m43,STAN,You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
21701,L122105,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point."
21702,L122104,u686,m43,STAN,What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
21703,L122103,u676,m43,CHUCK,I was making a point.
21704,L122102,u686,m43,STAN,"The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection."
21705,L122101,u676,m43,CHUCK,You fucked us over.
21706,L122100,u686,m43,STAN,I'm touched.
21707,L122099,u676,m43,CHUCK,Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
21708,L122098,u686,m43,STAN,But I might not have.
21709,L122097,u676,m43,CHUCK,"I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up."
21710,L122096,u686,m43,STAN,It was fifteen minutes late.
21711,L122095,u676,m43,CHUCK,You what?
21712,L122093,u676,m43,CHUCK,Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
21713,L122092,u686,m43,STAN,How'd it go?
21714,L122091,u676,m43,CHUCK,Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
21715,L122090,u686,m43,STAN,"What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?"
21716,L122526,u676,m43,CHUCK,"No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on."
21717,L122525,u677,m43,CHUCK/CAPTAIN,"Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie..."
21718,L122524,u676,m43,CHUCK,"As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself."
21719,L122523,u677,m43,CHUCK/CAPTAIN,San Francisco.  And you?
21720,L122522,u676,m43,CHUCK,"May I ask, where are you bound?"
21721,L122521,u677,m43,CHUCK/CAPTAIN,Permission granted.
21722,L122520,u676,m43,CHUCK,"Permission to come aboard, sir."
21723,L131402,u697,m44,LARCH,I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
21724,L131401,u689,m44,ANGELA,Dr. Homer Wells.
21725,L131400,u697,m44,LARCH,I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
21726,L131356,u697,m44,LARCH,You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
21727,L131355,u689,m44,ANGELA,"Wilbur, he picked them for us himself..."
21728,L131354,u697,m44,LARCH,"Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!"
21729,L131287,u697,m44,LARCH,We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
21730,L131286,u689,m44,ANGELA,These *credentials* are against the law!
21731,L131283,u697,m44,LARCH,"Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the ""new blood"" is *for*!"
21732,L131282,u689,m44,ANGELA,You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
21733,L131281,u697,m44,LARCH,"""An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."""
21734,L131280,u689,m44,ANGELA,"This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!"
21735,L131275,u697,m44,LARCH,"One has to be more than ""careful"" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether."
21736,L131274,u689,m44,ANGELA,"It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur."
21737,L131273,u697,m44,LARCH,"He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to ""help""! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!"
21738,L131109,u689,m44,ANGELA,"Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes."
21739,L131108,u697,m44,LARCH,"He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy."
21740,L131107,u689,m44,ANGELA,"Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man."
21741,L131106,u697,m44,LARCH,"Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of ""seeing the world,"" isn't it?"
21742,L131105,u689,m44,ANGELA,He'll need clothes... some money...
21743,L130959,u697,m44,LARCH,"Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any ""new help."""
21744,L130958,u689,m44,ANGELA,They just want you to hire some new help.
21745,L130957,u697,m44,LARCH,They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
21746,L130927,u689,m44,ANGELA,"It was just the ether, Wilbur..."
21747,L130926,u697,m44,LARCH,You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
21748,L130925,u689,m44,ANGELA,Then I wasn't beautiful.
21749,L130924,u697,m44,LARCH,I was!
21750,L130923,u689,m44,ANGELA,You weren't dreaming about me.
21751,L130922,u697,m44,LARCH,I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
21752,L130884,u697,m44,LARCH,Life is waiting.
21753,L130883,u689,m44,ANGELA,"Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office."
21754,L130831,u689,m44,ANGELA,It claims to restore monthly regularity.
21755,L130830,u697,m44,LARCH,"It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue..."
21756,L130811,u697,m44,LARCH,"Try to think of nothing, Dorothy."
21757,L130810,u689,m44,ANGELA,Only if you can afford it.
21758,L130952,u695,m44,HOMER,"I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?"
21759,L130951,u690,m44,BUSTER,What's she so emotional about?
21760,L130949,u695,m44,HOMER,I doubt it. She's just an...
21761,L130948,u690,m44,BUSTER,I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
21762,L130947,u695,m44,HOMER,I know.
21763,L130946,u690,m44,BUSTER,"Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't."
21764,L130945,u690,m44,BUSTER,Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
21765,L130944,u695,m44,HOMER,Better than I can!
21766,L130943,u690,m44,BUSTER,And that I can drive a truck!
21767,L130942,u695,m44,HOMER,You cook very well!
21768,L130941,u690,m44,BUSTER,"Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little."
21769,L130940,u695,m44,HOMER,"What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?"
21770,L130939,u690,m44,BUSTER,"Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway."
21771,L130938,u695,m44,HOMER,"Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela."
21772,L130937,u690,m44,BUSTER,Why not?
21773,L130936,u695,m44,HOMER,"I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*."
21774,L130935,u690,m44,BUSTER,I mean your parents.
21775,L130849,u690,m44,BUSTER,"I'm sorry, Homer."
21776,L130848,u695,m44,HOMER,I'm *not* a doctor!
21777,L130847,u690,m44,BUSTER,But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
21778,L130846,u695,m44,HOMER,I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
21779,L130845,u690,m44,BUSTER,"*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether."
21780,L130844,u695,m44,HOMER,"He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether."
21781,L130843,u690,m44,BUSTER,He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
21782,L130842,u695,m44,HOMER,It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
21783,L130841,u690,m44,BUSTER,He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
21784,L131464,u697,m44,LARCH,"If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us."
21785,L131463,u690,m44,BUSTER,Shouldn't we tell Homer?
21786,L131462,u697,m44,LARCH,They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
21787,L131461,u690,m44,BUSTER,Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
21788,L131460,u697,m44,LARCH,I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
21789,L131459,u690,m44,BUSTER,What are you going to tell the little ones?
21790,L131013,u697,m44,LARCH,"She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*..."
21791,L131012,u690,m44,BUSTER,What'd she die of?
21792,L131643,u691,m44,CANDY,"Good night, Daddy."
21793,L131642,u705,m44,RAY,"Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already."
21794,L131641,u691,m44,CANDY,"Daddy, *please*..."
21795,L131640,u705,m44,RAY,How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
21796,L131494,u691,m44,CANDY,"Good night, Daddy."
21797,L131493,u705,m44,RAY,It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
21798,L131341,u691,m44,CANDY,"Wally said to say, ""Hello."""
21799,L131340,u705,m44,RAY,"He mentions Homer, too, you know."
21800,L131339,u691,m44,CANDY,"Daddy, it's a letter to *me*."
21801,L131338,u705,m44,RAY,I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
21802,L131337,u691,m44,CANDY,It's time somebody ate *them*.
21803,L131746,u695,m44,HOMER,"No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me."
21804,L131745,u691,m44,CANDY,"No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry."
21805,L131744,u695,m44,HOMER,I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
21806,L131743,u691,m44,CANDY,"I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter..."
21807,L131742,u695,m44,HOMER,Sure. Thanks.
21808,L131741,u691,m44,CANDY,"This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot."
21809,L131740,u695,m44,HOMER,She knows how to take care of herself.
21810,L131739,u691,m44,CANDY,Do you think she'll be all right?
21811,L131719,u691,m44,CANDY,You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
21812,L131718,u695,m44,HOMER,"And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you..."
21813,L131717,u691,m44,CANDY,Please don't...
21814,L131716,u695,m44,HOMER,"""...did."" Well, okay."
21815,L131715,u691,m44,CANDY,"Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did."
21816,L131714,u695,m44,HOMER,"I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?"
21817,L131713,u695,m44,HOMER,"No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you."
21818,L131712,u691,m44,CANDY,Please don't make me say it again.
21819,L131663,u691,m44,CANDY,What do you want me to *do*?
21820,L131662,u695,m44,HOMER,He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
21821,L131661,u691,m44,CANDY,He's *paralyzed*!
21822,L131660,u695,m44,HOMER,"I know, I'm sorry."
21823,L131659,u691,m44,CANDY,"For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!"
21824,L131658,u695,m44,HOMER,"You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!"
21825,L131657,u691,m44,CANDY,Stop it! Just cut it out!
21826,L131656,u695,m44,HOMER,"I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all..."
21827,L131655,u691,m44,CANDY,"If you're trying to be funny, Homer..."
21828,L131654,u695,m44,HOMER,"*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!"
21829,L131653,u691,m44,CANDY,"Please don't move, don't go anywhere."
21830,L131650,u691,m44,CANDY,"No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want..."
21831,L131649,u695,m44,HOMER,I know.  Is *that* nothing.
21832,L131648,u691,m44,CANDY,"No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too."
21833,L131647,u695,m44,HOMER,Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
21834,L131646,u691,m44,CANDY,Nothing.
21835,L131645,u695,m44,HOMER,Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
21836,L131604,u691,m44,CANDY,We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
21837,L131603,u695,m44,HOMER,Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
21838,L131602,u691,m44,CANDY,He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
21839,L131601,u695,m44,HOMER,Mr. Rose *knows*?
21840,L131600,u691,m44,CANDY,You don't understand! It's her father...
21841,L131599,u695,m44,HOMER,"Well, we can't force her. It's her decision."
21842,L131598,u691,m44,CANDY,She won't go to St. Cloud's!
21843,L131579,u691,m44,CANDY,"Well, we have to help her!"
21844,L131578,u695,m44,HOMER,I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
21845,L131577,u691,m44,CANDY,"We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there..."
21846,L131557,u691,m44,CANDY,"It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?"
21847,L131556,u695,m44,HOMER,"Okay, okay--I know you do, too."
21848,L131555,u691,m44,CANDY,"No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do."
21849,L131554,u695,m44,HOMER,Fine. That's all there is to it then.
21850,L131553,u691,m44,CANDY,I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
21851,L131552,u695,m44,HOMER,"So we should ""wait and see."" For how long?"
21852,L131551,u691,m44,CANDY,Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
21853,L131517,u695,m44,HOMER,I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
21854,L131516,u691,m44,CANDY,Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
21855,L131489,u691,m44,CANDY,"We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see."
21856,L131488,u695,m44,HOMER,*What* will be okay?
21857,L131487,u691,m44,CANDY,It will be okay.
21858,L131486,u695,m44,HOMER,Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
21859,L131481,u695,m44,HOMER,Right.
21860,L131480,u691,m44,CANDY,I *know* this was right.
21861,L131475,u691,m44,CANDY,"Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges."
21862,L131474,u695,m44,HOMER,Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
21863,L131457,u691,m44,CANDY,Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
21864,L131456,u695,m44,HOMER,That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
21865,L131455,u691,m44,CANDY,You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
21866,L131454,u695,m44,HOMER,How could you not *care* about the movie?
21867,L131452,u691,m44,CANDY,The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
21868,L131451,u695,m44,HOMER,Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
21869,L131450,u691,m44,CANDY,Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
21870,L131449,u695,m44,HOMER,Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
21871,L131448,u691,m44,CANDY,Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
21872,L131447,u691,m44,CANDY,Just a little privacy.
21873,L131446,u695,m44,HOMER,I never *asked* for any responsibility.
21874,L131445,u691,m44,CANDY,But you had so much *responsibility*.
21875,L131444,u695,m44,HOMER,I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
21876,L131443,u691,m44,CANDY,You don't miss it?
21877,L131441,u695,m44,HOMER,"I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone."
21878,L131440,u691,m44,CANDY,At least you were never lonely.
21879,L131439,u695,m44,HOMER,"It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing."
21880,L131438,u691,m44,CANDY,What are you so crazy about the movies for?
21881,L131436,u691,m44,CANDY,"Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie."
21882,L131435,u695,m44,HOMER,The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
21883,L131434,u695,m44,HOMER,You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
21884,L131433,u691,m44,CANDY,You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
21885,L131370,u691,m44,CANDY,"Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about ""King Kong""?! Is that medically possible?"
21886,L131369,u695,m44,HOMER,What's the *medical* explanation?
21887,L131368,u695,m44,HOMER,"Oh, sure!"
21888,L131367,u691,m44,CANDY,She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
21889,L131366,u695,m44,HOMER,"And what did she die of, exactly?"
21890,L131365,u691,m44,CANDY,She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
21891,L131364,u695,m44,HOMER,"First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him..."
21892,L131363,u695,m44,HOMER,"I *did* like it. All I said was, ""It's not 'King Kong'."""
21893,L131362,u691,m44,CANDY,But you looked as if you liked it.
21894,L131350,u695,m44,HOMER,"""King Kong"". It's really good."
21895,L131349,u691,m44,CANDY,You've seen only one movie? Which one?
21896,L131348,u695,m44,HOMER,"Yes! I've only seen one, though."
21897,L131347,u691,m44,CANDY,When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
21898,L131346,u695,m44,HOMER,People watched the movies in their cars?
21899,L131345,u691,m44,CANDY,"Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout."
21900,L131344,u695,m44,HOMER,A movie *outside*?
21901,L131326,u691,m44,CANDY,I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
21902,L131325,u695,m44,HOMER,I better go.
21903,L131324,u695,m44,HOMER,Okay...
21904,L131323,u691,m44,CANDY,"You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then."
21905,L131322,u691,m44,CANDY,"When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet."
21906,L131321,u695,m44,HOMER,Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
21907,L131320,u695,m44,HOMER,I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
21908,L131319,u691,m44,CANDY,So. Not bored yet?
21909,L131171,u695,m44,HOMER,Sure... I'll see you around.
21910,L131170,u691,m44,CANDY,I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
21911,L131155,u695,m44,HOMER,"It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal."
21912,L131154,u691,m44,CANDY,I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
21913,L131146,u695,m44,HOMER,I understand.
21914,L131145,u691,m44,CANDY,I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
21915,L131144,u695,m44,HOMER,Oh...
21916,L131143,u691,m44,CANDY,Burma!
21917,L131142,u695,m44,HOMER,Where's Mandalay?
21918,L131141,u691,m44,CANDY,He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
21919,L131140,u695,m44,HOMER,I know.
21920,L131136,u695,m44,HOMER,"I've never seen the ocean, either."
21921,L131135,u691,m44,CANDY,Really?
21922,L131134,u695,m44,HOMER,I've never seen a lobster.
21923,L131133,u691,m44,CANDY,"No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman."
21924,L131132,u695,m44,HOMER,"Is your family in the apple business, too?"
21925,L131048,u691,m44,CANDY,Two.
21926,L131047,u695,m44,HOMER,How many months are you?
21927,L131045,u691,m44,CANDY,Candy. Candy Kendall.
21928,L131044,u695,m44,HOMER,"So, Mrs..."
21929,L131595,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
21930,L131594,u691,m44,CANDY,"You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?"
21931,L131592,u691,m44,CANDY,Why?
21932,L131591,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,I can't go nowhere.
21933,L131590,u691,m44,CANDY,I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
21934,L131587,u691,m44,CANDY,"Yes, I *have*!"
21935,L131586,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"You ain't been through what I been through, Candy."
21936,L131585,u691,m44,CANDY,"Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this."
21937,L131584,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"I don't need no more clothes, thank you."
21938,L131583,u691,m44,CANDY,I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
21939,L131582,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,Hi...
21940,L131581,u691,m44,CANDY,Hi...
21941,L131543,u691,m44,CANDY,"Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places..."
21942,L131542,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,How is that Wally doing?
21943,L131245,u707,m44,WALLY,*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
21944,L131244,u691,m44,CANDY,He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
21945,L131242,u707,m44,WALLY,He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
21946,L131241,u691,m44,CANDY,You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
21947,L131240,u691,m44,CANDY,I know what you've been doing.
21948,L131239,u707,m44,WALLY,I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
21949,L131173,u707,m44,WALLY,"I love you, too. See you tomorrow."
21950,L131172,u691,m44,CANDY,"I love you, Wally."
21951,L131131,u707,m44,WALLY,"Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!"
21952,L131130,u691,m44,CANDY,There! You said it was boring.
21953,L131125,u707,m44,WALLY,"Well, they aren't."
21954,L131124,u691,m44,CANDY,"You said, ""Apples aren't exactly flying."""
21955,L131123,u707,m44,WALLY,I never said they were boring.
21956,L131122,u691,m44,CANDY,Wally thinks apples are boring.
21957,L131114,u691,m44,CANDY,No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
21958,L131113,u707,m44,WALLY,I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
21959,L131112,u691,m44,CANDY,I'm okay--I can walk.
21960,L131026,u707,m44,WALLY,"Well, this *is* an orphanage."
21961,L131025,u691,m44,CANDY,So many children. Are they all orphans?
21962,L130919,u695,m44,HOMER,"Only the right people can have you, Curly."
21963,L130918,u692,m44,CURLY,You mean somebody asked?
21964,L130917,u695,m44,HOMER,"Nobody special enough, Curly."
21965,L130916,u692,m44,CURLY,"Nobody's asked for me, have they?"
21966,L130915,u695,m44,HOMER,That's true.
21967,L130914,u692,m44,CURLY,Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
21968,L130913,u695,m44,HOMER,"You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you."
21969,L130912,u692,m44,CURLY,Nobody ever wants me!
21970,L130911,u695,m44,HOMER,They wanted a girl.
21971,L130910,u692,m44,CURLY,I thought they might take me.
21972,L131408,u693,m44,EDNA,Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
21973,L131407,u697,m44,LARCH,Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
21974,L131406,u693,m44,EDNA,I just wanted to ask you...
21975,L131359,u697,m44,LARCH,"I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!"
21976,L131358,u693,m44,EDNA,"He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too."
21977,L131357,u697,m44,LARCH,"Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!"
21978,L131289,u693,m44,EDNA,But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
21979,L131288,u697,m44,LARCH,So here is my candidate. What do you think?
21980,L131285,u697,m44,LARCH,"Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law."
21981,L131284,u693,m44,EDNA,You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
21982,L131279,u697,m44,LARCH,"""...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."""
21983,L131278,u693,m44,EDNA,"Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?"
21984,L131277,u697,m44,LARCH,"""Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."""
21985,L131104,u693,m44,EDNA,He's leaving...
21986,L131103,u697,m44,LARCH,I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
21987,L131009,u697,m44,LARCH,"You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook."
21988,L131008,u693,m44,EDNA,That's a heavy sedation.
21989,L130996,u697,m44,LARCH,"How old are you, dear? Thirteen?"
21990,L130995,u693,m44,EDNA,Her temperature is a hundred and four.
21991,L130993,u697,m44,LARCH,Someone not from Maine.
21992,L130992,u694,m44,FUZZY,What's an immigrant?
21993,L130991,u697,m44,LARCH,No. She was an immigrant.
21994,L130990,u694,m44,FUZZY,Did you grow up around here?
21995,L130989,u697,m44,LARCH,She looks after other people's children.
21996,L130988,u694,m44,FUZZY,What's a nanny do?
21997,L130987,u697,m44,LARCH,"She's dead now, too. She was a nanny."
21998,L130986,u694,m44,FUZZY,Did you know your mother better?
21999,L130985,u697,m44,LARCH,Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
22000,L130984,u694,m44,FUZZY,But did you know him?
22001,L130983,u697,m44,LARCH,*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
22002,L130982,u694,m44,FUZZY,*Liver* killed him?
22003,L130981,u697,m44,LARCH,Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
22004,L130980,u694,m44,FUZZY,Is *your* father dead?
22005,L131083,u694,m44,FUZZY,"Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway."
22006,L131082,u695,m44,HOMER,"Don't get too excited, Fuzzy."
22007,L131079,u694,m44,FUZZY,Is that soon?
22008,L131078,u695,m44,HOMER,Uh... it's the end of October.
22009,L130977,u694,m44,FUZZY,"His father's dead, right?"
22010,L130976,u695,m44,HOMER,"""I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."""
22011,L130972,u694,m44,FUZZY,That's why Kong loves her!
22012,L130971,u695,m44,HOMER,"Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right."
22013,L130970,u694,m44,FUZZY,Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
22014,L130862,u699,m44,MARY AGNES,I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
22015,L130861,u695,m44,HOMER,"No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep."
22016,L130860,u699,m44,MARY AGNES,Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
22017,L130859,u695,m44,HOMER,It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
22018,L130858,u699,m44,MARY AGNES,I don't remember.
22019,L130857,u695,m44,HOMER,Did you bite it?
22020,L131263,u707,m44,WALLY,"I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one."
22021,L131262,u695,m44,HOMER,"Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you."
22022,L131261,u707,m44,WALLY,"You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too."
22023,L131260,u695,m44,HOMER,"Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job."
22024,L131259,u707,m44,WALLY,"Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?"
22025,L131238,u707,m44,WALLY,The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
22026,L131237,u695,m44,HOMER,What about the trees?
22027,L131236,u707,m44,WALLY,It's almost like flying.
22028,L131189,u707,m44,WALLY,"Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss."
22029,L131188,u695,m44,HOMER,Migrants?
22030,L131187,u707,m44,WALLY,They're migrants.
22031,L131169,u695,m44,HOMER,"Oh, I would love that, Wally."
22032,L131168,u707,m44,WALLY,"Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring."
22033,L131165,u707,m44,WALLY,"Actually, I volunteered."
22034,L131164,u695,m44,HOMER,What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
22035,L131163,u707,m44,WALLY,I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
22036,L131162,u695,m44,HOMER,At what altitude?
22037,L131161,u707,m44,WALLY,*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
22038,L131160,u695,m44,HOMER,"""Burma run"" because you fly over Burma..."
22039,L131152,u695,m44,HOMER,It's all very normal.
22040,L131151,u707,m44,WALLY,I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
22041,L131150,u695,m44,HOMER,"This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time."
22042,L131129,u707,m44,WALLY,The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
22043,L131128,u695,m44,HOMER,"No, I'm not. I need a job."
22044,L131127,u707,m44,WALLY,"You're a little overqualified, aren't you?"
22045,L131126,u695,m44,HOMER,I think I'd probably like the apple business.
22046,L131089,u707,m44,WALLY,We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
22047,L131088,u695,m44,HOMER,Where are you going?
22048,L131087,u707,m44,WALLY,Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
22049,L131086,u695,m44,HOMER,I wonder if you might give me a ride.
22050,L131085,u707,m44,WALLY,"Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything."
22051,L131084,u695,m44,HOMER,Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
22052,L131066,u695,m44,HOMER,"No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time."
22053,L131065,u707,m44,WALLY,Really! Is it serious?
22054,L131064,u695,m44,HOMER,They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
22055,L131063,u707,m44,WALLY,Have you enlisted?
22056,L131062,u695,m44,HOMER,Liberator...
22057,L131061,u707,m44,WALLY,A B-24 Liberator.
22058,L131060,u695,m44,HOMER,What kind of plane are you flying?
22059,L131051,u707,m44,WALLY,"Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered..."
22060,L131050,u695,m44,HOMER,No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
22061,L131049,u707,m44,WALLY,"So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--"
22062,L131039,u707,m44,WALLY,It's okay--I don't mind.
22063,L131038,u695,m44,HOMER,I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
22064,L131736,u695,m44,HOMER,Right?
22065,L131735,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?"
22066,L131733,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me."
22067,L131732,u695,m44,HOMER,"There's more than one laceration, more than one cut."
22068,L131727,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?"
22069,L131726,u695,m44,HOMER,Where'd she get you?
22070,L131725,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her."
22071,L131684,u695,m44,HOMER,Okay. Then you can be of use.
22072,L131683,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"I'm stayin', Homer."
22073,L131680,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?"
22074,L131679,u695,m44,HOMER,"Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze."
22075,L131678,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?"
22076,L131677,u695,m44,HOMER,"One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps."
22077,L131676,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,What's that? What's it called?
22078,L131675,u695,m44,HOMER,"Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere."
22079,L131674,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"What business is you in, Homer?"
22080,L131673,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?"
22081,L131672,u695,m44,HOMER,Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
22082,L131616,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that."
22083,L131615,u695,m44,HOMER,But she's your *daughter*...
22084,L131613,u695,m44,HOMER,"Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes."
22085,L131612,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?"
22086,L131611,u695,m44,HOMER,You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
22087,L131610,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows."
22088,L131609,u695,m44,HOMER,You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
22089,L131608,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer."
22090,L131606,u695,m44,HOMER,Is it true?
22091,L131605,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!"
22092,L131484,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,You still doin' it too fast!
22093,L131483,u695,m44,HOMER,This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
22094,L131482,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry."
22095,L131412,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!"
22096,L131411,u695,m44,HOMER,"What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms."
22097,L131410,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts..."
22098,L131301,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong."
22099,L131300,u695,m44,HOMER,Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
22100,L131267,u695,m44,HOMER,I guess so...
22101,L131266,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?"
22102,L131233,u695,m44,HOMER,Okay...
22103,L131232,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them."
22104,L131216,u695,m44,HOMER,Right.
22105,L131215,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?"
22106,L131202,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there."
22107,L131201,u695,m44,HOMER,So. What should I do now?
22108,L131531,u697,m44,LARCH,"You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!"
22109,L131530,u695,m44,HOMER,I am not a doctor.
22110,L131100,u697,m44,LARCH,It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
22111,L131099,u695,m44,HOMER,I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
22112,L131098,u697,m44,LARCH,I don't need your gratitude.
22113,L131097,u695,m44,HOMER,You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
22114,L131096,u697,m44,LARCH,"Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!"
22115,L131095,u695,m44,HOMER,Of course.
22116,L131094,u697,m44,LARCH,"In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways."
22117,L131093,u695,m44,HOMER,I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
22118,L131092,u697,m44,LARCH,Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
22119,L131023,u697,m44,LARCH,"Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?"
22120,L131022,u695,m44,HOMER,Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
22121,L131021,u697,m44,LARCH,Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.
22122,L131020,u695,m44,HOMER,I'm happy I amuse you.
22123,L131019,u697,m44,LARCH,It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
22124,L131016,u697,m44,LARCH,How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
22125,L131015,u695,m44,HOMER,How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
22126,L130974,u697,m44,LARCH,It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
22127,L130973,u695,m44,HOMER,I thought it was my turn.
22128,L130962,u695,m44,HOMER,It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
22129,L130961,u697,m44,LARCH,"I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?"
22130,L130896,u697,m44,LARCH,"We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!"
22131,L130895,u695,m44,HOMER,"Okay, he's just a Wilbur then."
22132,L130894,u697,m44,LARCH,"I'm not crazy about the ""Little..."""
22133,L130893,u695,m44,HOMER,Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
22134,L130892,u697,m44,LARCH,You do it then.
22135,L130891,u695,m44,HOMER,I don't think so.
22136,L130890,u697,m44,LARCH,Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
22137,L130889,u695,m44,HOMER,"He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why."
22138,L130887,u697,m44,LARCH,It's my turn!
22139,L130886,u695,m44,HOMER,Nobody's named this one yet.
22140,L130885,u697,m44,LARCH,Where's the name sheet?
22141,L130854,u697,m44,LARCH,"When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections ""underdeveloped."" Would you?"
22142,L130853,u695,m44,HOMER,"But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?"
22143,L130852,u697,m44,LARCH,"I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*."
22144,L130851,u695,m44,HOMER,I haven't read that.
22145,L130850,u697,m44,LARCH,"Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along."
22146,L130838,u697,m44,LARCH,"Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself ""not a doctor""!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble."
22147,L130837,u695,m44,HOMER,"In other words, scurvy."
22148,L130836,u697,m44,LARCH,"If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C."
22149,L130835,u695,m44,HOMER,I don't know it.
22150,L130834,u697,m44,LARCH,"Christ, it's oil of tansy!"
22151,L130833,u697,m44,LARCH,Obviously.
22152,L130832,u695,m44,HOMER,It's obviously an aborticide.
22153,L130825,u697,m44,LARCH,"Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!"
22154,L130824,u695,m44,HOMER,It looks like scurvy.
22155,L130823,u697,m44,LARCH,No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
22156,L130822,u695,m44,HOMER,There was no visible wound?
22157,L130802,u697,m44,LARCH,"What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use."
22158,L130801,u695,m44,HOMER,One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
22159,L130800,u697,m44,LARCH,You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
22160,L130799,u695,m44,HOMER,"All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them."
22161,L130798,u697,m44,LARCH,I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
22162,L130797,u695,m44,HOMER,"Yes, for both."
22163,L130796,u697,m44,LARCH,First pregnancy?
22164,L131507,u695,m44,HOMER,Right.
22165,L131506,u703,m44,OLIVE,"Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?"
22166,L131503,u703,m44,OLIVE,"Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over."
22167,L131502,u695,m44,HOMER,Uh... sure.
22168,L131501,u703,m44,OLIVE,I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
22169,L131500,u695,m44,HOMER,"I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me."
22170,L131499,u703,m44,OLIVE,"There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone."
22171,L131498,u695,m44,HOMER,"Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here."
22172,L131497,u703,m44,OLIVE,"What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer."
22173,L131761,u702,m44,MUDDY,"Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!"
22174,L131760,u695,m44,HOMER,"Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on."
22175,L131697,u695,m44,HOMER,"""Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."""
22176,L131696,u702,m44,MUDDY,"We heard that one already, Homer."
22177,L131695,u695,m44,HOMER,"""One: Please don't smoke in bed."""
22178,L131620,u702,m44,MUDDY,Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
22179,L131619,u695,m44,HOMER,"How long's this been going on, Muddy?"
22180,L131618,u702,m44,MUDDY,"Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you."
22181,L131708,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
22182,L131707,u695,m44,HOMER,That's it.
22183,L131706,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,That's *it*?
22184,L131575,u695,m44,HOMER,"Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen..."
22185,L131574,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!"
22186,L131573,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
22187,L131572,u695,m44,HOMER,"What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go."
22188,L131571,u695,m44,HOMER,"Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you."
22189,L131570,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
22190,L131569,u695,m44,HOMER,But you don't look very happy.
22191,L131568,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business."
22192,L131567,u695,m44,HOMER,I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
22193,L131566,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,Not yet. What do you know about it?
22194,L131565,u695,m44,HOMER,"You're not yet three months, are you?"
22195,L131563,u695,m44,HOMER,I don't like watching anyone be sick.
22196,L131562,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
22197,L131561,u695,m44,HOMER,"You okay, Rose?"
22198,L131427,u695,m44,HOMER,Almost.
22199,L131426,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?"
22200,L131425,u695,m44,HOMER,Give men that. I know how to do it.
22201,L131382,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is."
22202,L131381,u695,m44,HOMER,I'm not in trouble.
22203,L131375,u695,m44,HOMER,No trouble.
22204,L131374,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope."
22205,L131221,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,I can't read. Nobody taught me.
22206,L131220,u695,m44,HOMER,Do you like to read?
22207,L131214,u695,m44,HOMER,"Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect."
22208,L131213,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,So what?
22209,L131212,u695,m44,HOMER,There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
22210,L131211,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,What you got a picture of your heart for?
22211,L131210,u695,m44,HOMER,It's just my heart.
22212,L131209,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,What's that?
22213,L131193,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?"
22214,L131192,u695,m44,HOMER,Rose Rose?
22215,L131417,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is..."
22216,L131416,u696,m44,JACK,You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
22217,L131415,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'."
22218,L131414,u696,m44,JACK,"Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!"
22219,L131413,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right."
22220,L131305,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight."
22221,L131304,u696,m44,JACK,I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
22222,L131296,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter."
22223,L131295,u696,m44,JACK,Shit. We don't know what he is.
22224,L131294,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Now, now. He's a good boy."
22225,L131293,u696,m44,JACK,Who cares?
22226,L131396,u697,m44,LARCH,"Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested."
22227,L131395,u701,m44,MRS. GOODHALL,I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
22228,L131392,u697,m44,LARCH,Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
22229,L131391,u701,m44,MRS. GOODHALL,You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
22230,L131390,u697,m44,LARCH,"Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!"
22231,L131389,u701,m44,MRS. GOODHALL,I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
22232,L131388,u697,m44,LARCH,"*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!"
22233,L131387,u701,m44,MRS. GOODHALL,Do you know him?
22234,L131637,u698,m44,MAJOR WINSLOW,"Four weeks or so, right around Halloween."
22235,L131636,u703,m44,OLIVE,"When will he be home, Major?"
22236,L131635,u698,m44,MAJOR WINSLOW,No autonomic effects... that's correct.
22237,L131632,u698,m44,MAJOR WINSLOW,"It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk."
22238,L131631,u703,m44,OLIVE,Then it's malaria?
22239,L131626,u698,m44,MAJOR WINSLOW,Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
22240,L131625,u703,m44,OLIVE,Why was he missing for twenty days?
22241,L131624,u698,m44,MAJOR WINSLOW,"When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either."
22242,L131710,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?"
22243,L131709,u704,m44,PEACHES,"They're *outrageous*, them rules!"
22244,L131550,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider."
22245,L131549,u704,m44,PEACHES,They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
22246,L131548,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that."
22247,L131541,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
22248,L131540,u704,m44,PEACHES,It look nicer then home!
22249,L131539,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,Don't this place look like home?
22250,L131510,u704,m44,PEACHES,We see you next harvest.
22251,L131509,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!"
22252,L131473,u704,m44,PEACHES,"Sorry, Homer..."
22253,L131472,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Mind your own business, Peaches."
22254,L131471,u704,m44,PEACHES,"Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?"
22255,L131218,u704,m44,PEACHES,They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
22256,L131217,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,They told me I was too old to serve.
22257,L131738,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?"
22258,L131737,u702,m44,MUDDY,"That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right."
22259,L131731,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?"
22260,L131730,u702,m44,MUDDY,"*You* taught her, I suppose..."
22261,L131729,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?"
22262,L131690,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today."
22263,L131689,u702,m44,MUDDY,I told him that you all is sick.
22264,L131688,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy."
22265,L131687,u702,m44,MUDDY,It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
22266,L131332,u702,m44,MUDDY,"Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time."
22267,L131331,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
22268,L131303,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about."
22269,L131302,u702,m44,MUDDY,*What* view?
22270,L131299,u702,m44,MUDDY,What view?
22271,L131298,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view."
22272,L131671,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"That's right, Homer. This ain't your business."
22273,L131670,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help."
22274,L131668,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go."
22275,L131667,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!"
22276,L131666,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please..."
22277,L131665,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,Where do you think you're going?
22278,L131514,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"You just stay out of trouble, Homer!"
22279,L131513,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right."
22280,L131432,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?"
22281,L131431,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!"
22282,L131430,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in."
22283,L131429,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
22284,L131380,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
22285,L131379,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer."
22286,L131308,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,What's lucky about that?
22287,L131307,u700,m44,MR. ROSE,"You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl..."
22288,L131306,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night."
22289,L131755,u704,m44,PEACHES,He ain't never been outta Maine!
22290,L131754,u702,m44,MUDDY,"You ever see a palm tree, Homer?"
22291,L131723,u702,m44,MUDDY,"She took off on the bicycle, man."
22292,L131722,u704,m44,PEACHES,She took off in the night!
22293,L131721,u702,m44,MUDDY,Rose Rose has runned away!
22294,L131424,u702,m44,MUDDY,"Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed."
22295,L131423,u704,m44,PEACHES,"The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*..."
22296,L131422,u702,m44,MUDDY,"You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man."
22297,L131377,u702,m44,MUDDY,She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
22298,L131376,u704,m44,PEACHES,That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
22299,L141325,u715,m45,LILY,You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
22300,L141324,u708,m45,ASHBY,"Oh. Well, thanks for the drink."
22301,L141322,u715,m45,LILY,Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
22302,L141321,u708,m45,ASHBY,"No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank."
22303,L141320,u715,m45,LILY,Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
22304,L141319,u708,m45,ASHBY,"Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery."
22305,L141318,u715,m45,LILY,"So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say ""no"" without ever using the word."
22306,L141317,u715,m45,LILY,On me. For the seat. Cheers.
22307,L141316,u708,m45,ASHBY,Can --
22308,L141315,u715,m45,LILY,"That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here."
22309,L141314,u708,m45,ASHBY,Silicon Valley?
22310,L141313,u715,m45,LILY,"It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there."
22311,L141312,u708,m45,ASHBY,"So, what do you do?"
22312,L141311,u715,m45,LILY,Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
22313,L141310,u708,m45,ASHBY,My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
22314,L141309,u708,m45,ASHBY,"Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks."
22315,L141308,u715,m45,LILY,"Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?"
22316,L141307,u708,m45,ASHBY,Tough day?
22317,L141306,u715,m45,LILY,Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
22318,L141303,u708,m45,ASHBY,I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
22319,L141302,u715,m45,LILY,But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
22320,L141564,u708,m45,ASHBY,"Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --"
22321,L141563,u713,m45,JAKE,Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
22322,L141442,u713,m45,JAKE,Two million.
22323,L141441,u708,m45,ASHBY,Ten percent. Of how much?
22324,L141440,u713,m45,JAKE,The standard ten.
22325,L141439,u713,m45,JAKE,Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
22326,L141438,u708,m45,ASHBY,"No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut."
22327,L141437,u713,m45,JAKE,You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
22328,L141436,u708,m45,ASHBY,Let's just slow down for a second...
22329,L141435,u713,m45,JAKE,You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
22330,L141434,u708,m45,ASHBY,What's this?
22331,L141433,u713,m45,JAKE,There'll be red flags.
22332,L141432,u708,m45,ASHBY,I know. It won't go unnoticed.
22333,L141431,u713,m45,JAKE,This has to happen fast.
22334,L141430,u708,m45,ASHBY,Everything looks in order.
22335,L141429,u713,m45,JAKE,We had to finalize the deal.
22336,L141363,u713,m45,JAKE,Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
22337,L141362,u708,m45,ASHBY,And you have this letter of intent?
22338,L141361,u713,m45,JAKE,"Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore."
22339,L141360,u708,m45,ASHBY,Sort of like a letter of intent.
22340,L141359,u713,m45,JAKE,"Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan."
22341,L141358,u708,m45,ASHBY,Big.Com. That Internet thing.
22342,L141357,u713,m45,JAKE,"Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?"
22343,L141353,u708,m45,ASHBY,I don't follow.
22344,L141352,u713,m45,JAKE,We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
22345,L141351,u708,m45,ASHBY,Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
22346,L141350,u713,m45,JAKE,They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
22347,L141349,u708,m45,ASHBY,That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
22348,L141348,u713,m45,JAKE,"A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part."
22349,L141347,u708,m45,ASHBY,"Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --"
22350,L141346,u713,m45,JAKE,Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
22351,L141345,u713,m45,JAKE,"Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing."
22352,L141342,u708,m45,ASHBY,What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
22353,L141341,u713,m45,JAKE,"What do you do over at your bank, Grant?"
22354,L141333,u708,m45,ASHBY,I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
22355,L141332,u713,m45,JAKE,"Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses."
22356,L140825,u709,m45,BIG AL,It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
22357,L140824,u713,m45,JAKE,It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
22358,L140797,u709,m45,BIG AL,I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
22359,L140796,u713,m45,JAKE,"What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?"
22360,L140795,u709,m45,BIG AL,"Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted."
22361,L140794,u713,m45,JAKE,Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
22362,L140793,u709,m45,BIG AL,"Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?"
22363,L141678,u710,m45,BUTCH,"So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three..."
22364,L141677,u713,m45,JAKE,Guess so.
22365,L141676,u710,m45,BUTCH,Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
22366,L141675,u713,m45,JAKE,"It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark."
22367,L141674,u710,m45,BUTCH,"Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?"
22368,L141673,u713,m45,JAKE,Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
22369,L141672,u710,m45,BUTCH,"Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?"
22370,L141553,u713,m45,JAKE,Today? Started off great...
22371,L141552,u710,m45,BUTCH,"Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?"
22372,L141536,u713,m45,JAKE,She walked.
22373,L141535,u710,m45,BUTCH,After you cut her loose.
22374,L141534,u713,m45,JAKE,We were back on.
22375,L141519,u710,m45,BUTCH,"Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!"
22376,L141518,u713,m45,JAKE,It's not true.
22377,L141517,u710,m45,BUTCH,"BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it."
22378,L141516,u713,m45,JAKE,I was doing it for them.
22379,L141515,u710,m45,BUTCH,"So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl..."
22380,L141398,u713,m45,JAKE,You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
22381,L141397,u710,m45,BUTCH,"Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?"
22382,L141293,u713,m45,JAKE,"My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million."
22383,L141292,u710,m45,BUTCH,She had you tempting fate.
22384,L141267,u713,m45,JAKE,"Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all."
22385,L141266,u710,m45,BUTCH,Like what?
22386,L141265,u713,m45,JAKE,Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
22387,L141264,u710,m45,BUTCH,You're a superstitious fucker.
22388,L141263,u713,m45,JAKE,"Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck."
22389,L141262,u713,m45,JAKE,Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
22390,L141139,u713,m45,JAKE,We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
22391,L141138,u710,m45,BUTCH,Nice.
22392,L141091,u710,m45,BUTCH,Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
22393,L141090,u713,m45,JAKE,He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
22394,L141067,u713,m45,JAKE,Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
22395,L141066,u710,m45,BUTCH,But there were other factors.
22396,L141021,u713,m45,JAKE,That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
22397,L141020,u710,m45,BUTCH,I can see why you liked her.
22398,L140984,u713,m45,JAKE,"Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer."
22399,L140983,u710,m45,BUTCH,So how'd you get caught?
22400,L140958,u710,m45,BUTCH,"In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con."
22401,L140957,u713,m45,JAKE,So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
22402,L140956,u710,m45,BUTCH,Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
22403,L140955,u713,m45,JAKE,You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
22404,L140954,u710,m45,BUTCH,Keeping the Fix happy.
22405,L140932,u710,m45,BUTCH,And these cops? What do they get?
22406,L140931,u713,m45,JAKE,"I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley."
22407,L140819,u713,m45,JAKE,Isn't it always?
22408,L140818,u710,m45,BUTCH,"It's all about the money, isn't it?"
22409,L140817,u713,m45,JAKE,We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
22410,L140816,u710,m45,BUTCH,Grifters...
22411,L140751,u710,m45,BUTCH,That's not a bad place to start.
22412,L140750,u713,m45,JAKE,Just the last three weeks.
22413,L140749,u710,m45,BUTCH,Your life flashing before your eyes?
22414,L140748,u713,m45,JAKE,Gee... What makes you say that?
22415,L140747,u710,m45,BUTCH,"Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake."
22416,L140746,u710,m45,BUTCH,No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
22417,L140745,u713,m45,JAKE,The Anti-Christ?
22418,L140744,u710,m45,BUTCH,"Know who I am, Jake?"
22419,L140743,u713,m45,JAKE,And I think it's because of this redhead...
22420,L141645,u711,m45,GILLETTE,Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
22421,L141644,u710,m45,BUTCH,"Ten is standard, sir."
22422,L141641,u711,m45,GILLETTE,And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
22423,L141640,u710,m45,BUTCH,We'll take care of it.
22424,L141639,u711,m45,GILLETTE,"I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby."
22425,L141638,u710,m45,BUTCH,So we go to the bar.
22426,L141637,u711,m45,GILLETTE,"Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money."
22427,L141636,u710,m45,BUTCH,Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
22428,L141368,u718,m45,MILES,I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
22429,L141367,u712,m45,GORDO,"Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy."
22430,L141288,u718,m45,MILES,"It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake..."
22431,L141287,u712,m45,GORDO,The red hair... It's bad luck.
22432,L141051,u712,m45,GORDO,"People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A."
22433,L141050,u718,m45,MILES,"This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard."
22434,L140879,u712,m45,GORDO,"Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?"
22435,L140878,u718,m45,MILES,Fuck that. We're going too.
22436,L140864,u718,m45,MILES,We're going to give him the money back?
22437,L140863,u712,m45,GORDO,Whoa. What?
22438,L140858,u712,m45,GORDO,Come on...
22439,L140857,u718,m45,MILES,We sure Big Al threw him to us?
22440,L140856,u712,m45,GORDO,Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
22441,L140854,u712,m45,GORDO,"No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --"
22442,L140853,u718,m45,MILES,You're pissed we didn't get credit?
22443,L140852,u712,m45,GORDO,"What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced."
22444,L140851,u718,m45,MILES,"So what? We hide, right?"
22445,L140850,u712,m45,GORDO,"Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald."
22446,L140849,u718,m45,MILES,Mob?
22447,L140848,u712,m45,GORDO,"Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses."
22448,L140847,u718,m45,MILES,What's a King Pin?
22449,L140846,u712,m45,GORDO,"The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says ""boo."""
22450,L140845,u718,m45,MILES,Who's that?
22451,L141489,u712,m45,GORDO,"Jake, I mean, come on --"
22452,L141488,u715,m45,LILY,That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
22453,L141481,u715,m45,LILY,So what? We just stay clear of him.
22454,L141480,u712,m45,GORDO,Moonan. Here. Shit...
22455,L141370,u712,m45,GORDO,"Let's go, Jake?"
22456,L141369,u715,m45,LILY,I'm going home
22457,L141355,u715,m45,LILY,It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
22458,L141354,u712,m45,GORDO,Jake...
22459,L141335,u715,m45,LILY,"So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?"
22460,L141334,u712,m45,GORDO,Masters of our own destiny.
22461,L141612,u713,m45,JAKE,What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
22462,L141611,u712,m45,GORDO,You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
22463,L141573,u712,m45,GORDO,"I'd like this cashed, please."
22464,L141572,u713,m45,JAKE,Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
22465,L141505,u713,m45,JAKE,That's it.
22466,L141504,u712,m45,GORDO,So that's it...
22467,L141487,u713,m45,JAKE,"What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up."
22468,L141486,u712,m45,GORDO,Jake --
22469,L141448,u713,m45,JAKE,We'll use the Euc.
22470,L141447,u712,m45,GORDO,Calls?
22471,L141446,u713,m45,JAKE,Eight A.M. flight.
22472,L141445,u712,m45,GORDO,You'll be there?
22473,L141444,u713,m45,JAKE,And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
22474,L141443,u712,m45,GORDO,"We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over."
22475,L141372,u712,m45,GORDO,You sure?
22476,L141371,u713,m45,JAKE,Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
22477,L141327,u712,m45,GORDO,"So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says ""The code's fine, the program's for shit"" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!"
22478,L141326,u713,m45,JAKE,She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
22479,L141297,u713,m45,JAKE,She's up for it.
22480,L141296,u712,m45,GORDO,She up for this?
22481,L141100,u713,m45,JAKE,"Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance..."
22482,L141099,u712,m45,GORDO,"You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --"
22483,L141062,u713,m45,JAKE,"No, not ""whatever."" You're either in or you're out."
22484,L141061,u712,m45,GORDO,"Yeah... Whatever, Jake."
22485,L141038,u713,m45,JAKE,We pay better.
22486,L141037,u712,m45,GORDO,How's that? He works for Gillette.
22487,L141036,u713,m45,JAKE,"We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need."
22488,L141031,u713,m45,JAKE,We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
22489,L141030,u712,m45,GORDO,We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
22490,L141029,u713,m45,JAKE,Two million.
22491,L141028,u712,m45,GORDO,How much we going after?
22492,L140996,u713,m45,JAKE,"Yes, her. Where's my wallet?"
22493,L140995,u712,m45,GORDO,You gotta be kidding me. Her?
22494,L140877,u713,m45,JAKE,Tonight. Just me.
22495,L140876,u712,m45,GORDO,When?
22496,L140867,u713,m45,JAKE,"Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too."
22497,L140866,u712,m45,GORDO,And what about Big Al?
22498,L140865,u713,m45,JAKE,You know what we're doing with the money.
22499,L140844,u712,m45,GORDO,"It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the ""Send?"" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin."
22500,L140843,u713,m45,JAKE,"Well, this is just fucking great..."
22501,L140842,u712,m45,GORDO,Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
22502,L140823,u712,m45,GORDO,"I just don't know if this says, ""me"". What's the fabric?"
22503,L140822,u713,m45,JAKE,It can buy you a new and better you.
22504,L140801,u712,m45,GORDO,I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
22505,L140800,u713,m45,JAKE,Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
22506,L140799,u712,m45,GORDO,That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
22507,L140798,u713,m45,JAKE,What? I can feel you looking at me.
22508,L140791,u712,m45,GORDO,But you won't get that splatter effect.
22509,L140790,u713,m45,JAKE,"I told you, use less powder."
22510,L140789,u712,m45,GORDO,Shit.
22511,L141134,u714,m45,KING PIN,"Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy."
22512,L141133,u713,m45,JAKE,I think I just broke my hand.
22513,L141132,u714,m45,KING PIN,Come on. Harder.
22514,L141128,u714,m45,KING PIN,Come here!
22515,L141127,u713,m45,JAKE,No thanks. I'm good.
22516,L141126,u714,m45,KING PIN,Come here. Feel this.
22517,L141125,u713,m45,JAKE,"You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?"
22518,L141124,u714,m45,KING PIN,"Look at you, you skinny prick."
22519,L141122,u714,m45,KING PIN,I said take off your fucking shirt.
22520,L141121,u713,m45,JAKE,Excuse me?
22521,L141119,u713,m45,JAKE,"No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape."
22522,L141118,u714,m45,KING PIN,"Listen, Scooter --"
22523,L141115,u714,m45,KING PIN,"Hey Skippy? Do I have the word ""chump"" tattooed on my forehead?"
22524,L141114,u713,m45,JAKE,"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
22525,L141113,u714,m45,KING PIN,That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
22526,L141112,u713,m45,JAKE,I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
22527,L141111,u714,m45,KING PIN,Stake you?
22528,L141110,u713,m45,JAKE,I need you to stake me.
22529,L141109,u714,m45,KING PIN,"What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid."
22530,L141108,u713,m45,JAKE,I think two million.
22531,L141107,u714,m45,KING PIN,How much?
22532,L140927,u714,m45,KING PIN,You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
22533,L140926,u713,m45,JAKE,Why?
22534,L140919,u713,m45,JAKE,We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
22535,L140918,u714,m45,KING PIN,"I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once."
22536,L140917,u713,m45,JAKE,No. Just confidence.
22537,L140916,u714,m45,KING PIN,"Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much."
22538,L140915,u713,m45,JAKE,"I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square."
22539,L140914,u714,m45,KING PIN,"Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you..."
22540,L140913,u713,m45,JAKE,Because you killed one of my crew.
22541,L140912,u714,m45,KING PIN,Let me repeat -- Why not?
22542,L140911,u713,m45,JAKE,Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
22543,L140910,u714,m45,KING PIN,Why not?
22544,L140909,u713,m45,JAKE,I can't do that.
22545,L140908,u714,m45,KING PIN,Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
22546,L140907,u713,m45,JAKE,I apologize for the inconvenience.
22547,L140906,u714,m45,KING PIN,You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
22548,L140905,u713,m45,JAKE,You can't cheat an honest man.
22549,L140904,u714,m45,KING PIN,"Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find."
22550,L140903,u713,m45,JAKE,I guess it lacks a certain style.
22551,L140902,u714,m45,KING PIN,"You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it."
22552,L140901,u713,m45,JAKE,Minus one.
22553,L140900,u714,m45,KING PIN,Minus one.
22554,L140899,u713,m45,JAKE,I have a good crew.
22555,L140898,u714,m45,KING PIN,"Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?"
22556,L140897,u713,m45,JAKE,Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
22557,L140896,u714,m45,KING PIN,"Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy."
22558,L141583,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
22559,L141582,u713,m45,JAKE,Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
22560,L141463,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,Good boy.
22561,L141462,u713,m45,JAKE,Something stupid.
22562,L141461,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake."
22563,L141460,u713,m45,JAKE,Wouldn't dream of it.
22564,L141459,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
22565,L141458,u713,m45,JAKE,Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
22566,L141457,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"Ring it for him, Sobo."
22567,L141456,u713,m45,JAKE,Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
22568,L141455,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
22569,L141452,u713,m45,JAKE,"Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business."
22570,L141451,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed."
22571,L141450,u713,m45,JAKE,That tip not work-out for you fellas?
22572,L140814,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else."
22573,L140813,u713,m45,JAKE,All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
22574,L140812,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals."
22575,L140809,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces."
22576,L140808,u713,m45,JAKE,What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
22577,L141230,u720,m45,MR. LEWIS,Sure.
22578,L141229,u713,m45,JAKE,"Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?"
22579,L141225,u713,m45,JAKE,Very much so.
22580,L141224,u720,m45,MR. LEWIS,"Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?"
22581,L141223,u713,m45,JAKE,"Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?"
22582,L141222,u720,m45,MR. LEWIS,Attractive girl.
22583,L141216,u713,m45,JAKE,My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
22584,L141215,u720,m45,MR. LEWIS,"What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?"
22585,L141210,u720,m45,MR. LEWIS,Great. Thank you.
22586,L141209,u713,m45,JAKE,"Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?"
22587,L141208,u720,m45,MR. LEWIS,Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
22588,L141207,u713,m45,JAKE,Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
22589,L141206,u720,m45,MR. LEWIS,"Sorry, I --"
22590,L140775,u713,m45,JAKE,What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
22591,L140774,u716,m45,LIONEL,What about... The money?
22592,L140760,u713,m45,JAKE,Help me.
22593,L140759,u716,m45,LIONEL,What -- What do we do?
22594,L140758,u713,m45,JAKE,LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
22595,L140757,u716,m45,LIONEL,Oh Jesus!
22596,L140756,u713,m45,JAKE,Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
22597,L140755,u716,m45,LIONEL,I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
22598,L140754,u713,m45,JAKE,"I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!"
22599,L140753,u716,m45,LIONEL,Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
22600,L140752,u713,m45,JAKE,I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
22601,L141691,u715,m45,LILY,"No, I want my cut!"
22602,L141690,u713,m45,JAKE,What do you want? An apology?
22603,L141689,u713,m45,JAKE,"You tell them the ""Tale""."
22604,L141671,u715,m45,LILY,You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
22605,L141670,u713,m45,JAKE,"What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?"
22606,L141625,u713,m45,JAKE,"It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it."
22607,L141624,u715,m45,LILY,You got my cell. Leave a message.
22608,L141551,u715,m45,LILY,"Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you."
22609,L141550,u713,m45,JAKE,Sorry. I didn't know...
22610,L141502,u713,m45,JAKE,"I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut."
22611,L141501,u715,m45,LILY,"No, I want my cut!"
22612,L141500,u713,m45,JAKE,"So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?"
22613,L141499,u715,m45,LILY,What about the money?
22614,L141498,u713,m45,JAKE,What about what?
22615,L141497,u715,m45,LILY,What about...
22616,L141496,u713,m45,JAKE,"There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over."
22617,L141495,u715,m45,LILY,"Everyone's working an angle, right?"
22618,L141494,u713,m45,JAKE,"Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either."
22619,L141493,u715,m45,LILY,You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
22620,L141483,u713,m45,JAKE,"No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time."
22621,L141482,u715,m45,LILY,Jesus... Take it easy.
22622,L141424,u715,m45,LILY,"You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too."
22623,L141423,u713,m45,JAKE,No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
22624,L141422,u715,m45,LILY,"I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way."
22625,L141421,u713,m45,JAKE,"Did, uh... Did you kill him?"
22626,L141420,u715,m45,LILY,"After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times."
22627,L141419,u713,m45,JAKE,Lily... Jesus Christ...
22628,L141418,u715,m45,LILY,"Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him."
22629,L141417,u715,m45,LILY,"Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to ""fuck some sense into me."""
22630,L141416,u713,m45,JAKE,He was looking out for you.
22631,L141415,u715,m45,LILY,"Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me."
22632,L141414,u713,m45,JAKE,Glenn talked you out of it.
22633,L141413,u715,m45,LILY,"No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?"
22634,L141412,u713,m45,JAKE,You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
22635,L141411,u715,m45,LILY,"We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird."
22636,L141410,u713,m45,JAKE,"Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me."
22637,L141409,u715,m45,LILY,"He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that."
22638,L141408,u713,m45,JAKE,You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
22639,L141407,u715,m45,LILY,"Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something."
22640,L141406,u713,m45,JAKE,Sounds respectable.
22641,L141405,u715,m45,LILY,"Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper."
22642,L141402,u713,m45,JAKE,"I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?"
22643,L141401,u715,m45,LILY,WHAT?
22644,L141400,u713,m45,JAKE,How do you deal with --
22645,L141396,u713,m45,JAKE,Don't ruin this for me.
22646,L141395,u715,m45,LILY,You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
22647,L141394,u713,m45,JAKE,Intuition.
22648,L141393,u715,m45,LILY,How do you know I will?
22649,L141392,u713,m45,JAKE,No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
22650,L141391,u715,m45,LILY,So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
22651,L141390,u713,m45,JAKE,Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
22652,L141389,u715,m45,LILY,It's more than that.
22653,L141388,u713,m45,JAKE,"I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it."
22654,L141387,u715,m45,LILY,Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
22655,L141386,u713,m45,JAKE,Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
22656,L141385,u715,m45,LILY,I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
22657,L141384,u713,m45,JAKE,Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
22658,L141383,u715,m45,LILY,Do you have something to prove?
22659,L141382,u713,m45,JAKE,Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
22660,L141381,u715,m45,LILY,Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
22661,L141380,u713,m45,JAKE,It's what I do. It's my job.
22662,L141379,u715,m45,LILY,I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
22663,L141378,u713,m45,JAKE,For what? A couple hundred bucks?
22664,L141377,u715,m45,LILY,Look at you... You want to go.
22665,L141365,u713,m45,JAKE,"Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help."
22666,L141364,u715,m45,LILY,We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
22667,L141286,u715,m45,LILY,Did I miss something?
22668,L141285,u713,m45,JAKE,What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
22669,L141284,u715,m45,LILY,You told me to change my hair!
22670,L141280,u713,m45,JAKE,But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
22671,L141279,u715,m45,LILY,Lighten up.
22672,L141278,u713,m45,JAKE,You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
22673,L141253,u713,m45,JAKE,Uh-huh.
22674,L141252,u715,m45,LILY,I gotta go get a haircut.
22675,L141251,u713,m45,JAKE,Uh-huh.
22676,L141250,u715,m45,LILY,He's gone.
22677,L141219,u713,m45,JAKE,"Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily."
22678,L141218,u715,m45,LILY,Uh... Everything okay?
22679,L141197,u715,m45,LILY,Then show me how.
22680,L141196,u713,m45,JAKE,I don't trust anyone.
22681,L141195,u715,m45,LILY,You're just going to have to trust me.
22682,L141194,u713,m45,JAKE,"We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can."
22683,L141193,u715,m45,LILY,Why?
22684,L141192,u713,m45,JAKE,And some new clothes.
22685,L141191,u715,m45,LILY,What?
22686,L141190,u713,m45,JAKE,You need to get a haircut.
22687,L141189,u715,m45,LILY,"It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?"
22688,L141188,u713,m45,JAKE,Don't worry about it.
22689,L141187,u715,m45,LILY,What the hell's his problem?
22690,L141117,u713,m45,JAKE,"Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here."
22691,L141116,u715,m45,LILY,"Mr. King, I think --"
22692,L141106,u713,m45,JAKE,Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
22693,L141105,u715,m45,LILY,"Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut."
22694,L141104,u713,m45,JAKE,I'll worry about Customs.
22695,L141103,u715,m45,LILY,What about Customs?
22696,L141016,u713,m45,JAKE,Just play a part. A little acting.
22697,L141015,u715,m45,LILY,What do I have to do?
22698,L141014,u713,m45,JAKE,You get an equal cut.
22699,L141013,u715,m45,LILY,No.  What's my cut?
22700,L141012,u713,m45,JAKE,I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
22701,L141011,u715,m45,LILY,Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
22702,L141010,u713,m45,JAKE,We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
22703,L141009,u715,m45,LILY,Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
22704,L141008,u713,m45,JAKE,Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
22705,L141005,u715,m45,LILY,"Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?"
22706,L141004,u713,m45,JAKE,We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
22707,L141003,u713,m45,JAKE,"You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me."
22708,L141002,u715,m45,LILY,Says who?
22709,L141001,u713,m45,JAKE,"Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?"
22710,L141000,u715,m45,LILY,"Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake."
22711,L140999,u713,m45,JAKE,You interested in a little work?
22712,L140998,u715,m45,LILY,That's not --
22713,L140994,u713,m45,JAKE,We're not cops.
22714,L140993,u715,m45,LILY,What is this? You guys cops or something?
22715,L141561,u718,m45,MILES,Jake? Customs?
22716,L141560,u713,m45,JAKE,And we got rid of the red head.
22717,L141559,u718,m45,MILES,And we got rid of the red head.
22718,L141558,u713,m45,JAKE,"Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light."
22719,L141492,u713,m45,JAKE,Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
22720,L141491,u718,m45,MILES,Escorts!
22721,L141490,u713,m45,JAKE,"No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!"
22722,L141485,u713,m45,JAKE,There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
22723,L141484,u718,m45,MILES,What do we do? We change the scam?
22724,L141329,u718,m45,MILES,"But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!"
22725,L141328,u713,m45,JAKE,"So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, ""You're fired! Your whole team's fired!"" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --"
22726,L141269,u718,m45,MILES,Where the hell is she?
22727,L141268,u713,m45,JAKE,But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
22728,L141151,u718,m45,MILES,You sure?
22729,L141150,u713,m45,JAKE,Him.
22730,L141141,u718,m45,MILES,Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
22731,L141140,u713,m45,JAKE,What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
22732,L141102,u713,m45,JAKE,"No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker."
22733,L141101,u718,m45,MILES,Is it all fugasi?
22734,L141060,u713,m45,JAKE,"I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?"
22735,L141059,u718,m45,MILES,"Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like ""twenty-five to life"" pissed."
22736,L141058,u713,m45,JAKE,We're getting a little old for running.
22737,L141057,u718,m45,MILES,What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
22738,L141056,u713,m45,JAKE,"Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before."
22739,L141055,u718,m45,MILES,We never had a problem with that before.
22740,L141054,u713,m45,JAKE,"Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?"
22741,L141053,u718,m45,MILES,"Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea..."
22742,L141052,u713,m45,JAKE,"It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs."
22743,L141044,u713,m45,JAKE,Good point.
22744,L141043,u718,m45,MILES,"I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?"
22745,L141042,u713,m45,JAKE,What?
22746,L141041,u718,m45,MILES,Uh...
22747,L141024,u713,m45,JAKE,Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
22748,L141023,u718,m45,MILES,Why?
22749,L140991,u713,m45,JAKE,Breasts.
22750,L140990,u718,m45,MILES,What do we need another Shill for?
22751,L140989,u713,m45,JAKE,No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
22752,L140986,u718,m45,MILES,Wait a second... Who's the mope?
22753,L140985,u713,m45,JAKE,We're working for the King.
22754,L140977,u713,m45,JAKE,Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
22755,L140976,u718,m45,MILES,You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
22756,L140882,u713,m45,JAKE,I'm getting a ride.
22757,L140881,u718,m45,MILES,How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
22758,L140880,u713,m45,JAKE,Meet me at my place later.
22759,L140875,u713,m45,JAKE,"Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you."
22760,L140874,u718,m45,MILES,Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
22761,L140862,u713,m45,JAKE,He'll find us. We go talk to him.
22762,L140861,u718,m45,MILES,"Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere..."
22763,L140860,u713,m45,JAKE,It's bad luck.
22764,L140840,u718,m45,MILES,Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
22765,L140839,u713,m45,JAKE,Miles...
22766,L140838,u718,m45,MILES,"I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got."
22767,L140837,u718,m45,MILES,You better get over to Al's. Now.
22768,L140836,u713,m45,JAKE,Yeah.
22769,L140781,u718,m45,MILES,You sure we're clear?
22770,L140780,u713,m45,JAKE,Stop waving that thing around.
22771,L140767,u718,m45,MILES,My place.
22772,L140766,u713,m45,JAKE,Then shut up.
22773,L140765,u718,m45,MILES,Your mess.
22774,L140764,u713,m45,JAKE,"If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up."
22775,L140763,u718,m45,MILES,Tick-tock...
22776,L141243,u713,m45,JAKE,This is embarrassing.
22777,L141242,u722,m45,SALESGIRL,I'm sorry.
22778,L141241,u713,m45,JAKE,"I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later..."
22779,L141240,u722,m45,SALESGIRL,I'm sorry.
22780,L141239,u713,m45,JAKE,"I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?"
22781,L141238,u722,m45,SALESGIRL,With identification.
22782,L141237,u713,m45,JAKE,"Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?"
22783,L141236,u722,m45,SALESGIRL,That's no problem. We have those in stock.
22784,L141235,u713,m45,JAKE,"A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one."
22785,L141234,u722,m45,SALESGIRL,What was it?
22786,L141233,u713,m45,JAKE,You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
22787,L141232,u722,m45,SALESGIRL,I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
22788,L141213,u713,m45,JAKE,"You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson."
22789,L141212,u722,m45,SALESGIRL,Do you have a ticket?
22790,L141211,u713,m45,JAKE,Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
22791,L141693,u717,m45,LUPUS,"You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport..."
22792,L141692,u713,m45,JAKE,"And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head..."
22793,L141663,u713,m45,JAKE,HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
22794,L141662,u717,m45,LUPUS,Sorry. What?
22795,L141661,u713,m45,JAKE,Eee Oott Auught!
22796,L141660,u717,m45,LUPUS,What happened?
22797,L141632,u717,m45,LUPUS,"No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-"
22798,L141631,u713,m45,JAKE,Stand up.
22799,L141630,u717,m45,LUPUS,What?
22800,L141629,u713,m45,JAKE,Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
22801,L141627,u713,m45,JAKE,"That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different."
22802,L141626,u717,m45,LUPUS,"You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool."
22803,L141623,u717,m45,LUPUS,Keep it up.
22804,L141622,u713,m45,JAKE,What's up with you? Bladder infection?
22805,L141616,u713,m45,JAKE,That was fucking deep.
22806,L141615,u717,m45,LUPUS,Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
22807,L141614,u713,m45,JAKE,He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
22808,L141588,u717,m45,LUPUS,You're a weasel.
22809,L141587,u713,m45,JAKE,"Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here."
22810,L141586,u717,m45,LUPUS,"So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride."
22811,L141532,u713,m45,JAKE,"Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck."
22812,L141531,u717,m45,LUPUS,What'd he say?
22813,L141514,u717,m45,LUPUS,"Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake."
22814,L141513,u713,m45,JAKE,"Point, Lupus. Give us a point."
22815,L141512,u717,m45,LUPUS,"Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business."
22816,L141511,u713,m45,JAKE,My fucking heart bleeds.
22817,L141510,u717,m45,LUPUS,"Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door."
22818,L141509,u713,m45,JAKE,Of what? They're both crooks.
22819,L141508,u717,m45,LUPUS,"What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous."
22820,L141507,u713,m45,JAKE,"Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet."
22821,L141506,u717,m45,LUPUS,King ain't gonna like this.
22822,L141376,u713,m45,JAKE,I'll find the time.
22823,L141375,u717,m45,LUPUS,You going to have the time?
22824,L141374,u713,m45,JAKE,"When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al."
22825,L141185,u724,m45,SUITS,"Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?"
22826,L141184,u713,m45,JAKE,Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
22827,L141183,u724,m45,SUITS,Still time.
22828,L141181,u724,m45,SUITS,"Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want."
22829,L141180,u713,m45,JAKE,I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
22830,L141179,u724,m45,SUITS,So what do you want?
22831,L141178,u713,m45,JAKE,It's not history.
22832,L141177,u724,m45,SUITS,I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
22833,L141176,u713,m45,JAKE,I can handle it.
22834,L141175,u724,m45,SUITS,"The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all."
22835,L141174,u713,m45,JAKE,The King.
22836,L141173,u724,m45,SUITS,Then who's the Banker?
22837,L141172,u713,m45,JAKE,Can't say.
22838,L141171,u724,m45,SUITS,"I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, ""the kid's a prodigy."" But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?"
22839,L141170,u724,m45,SUITS,"Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake."
22840,L141169,u713,m45,JAKE,A little bit of both.
22841,L141168,u724,m45,SUITS,"Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob."
22842,L141167,u713,m45,JAKE,Huh? Oh. She's alright.
22843,L141166,u724,m45,SUITS,Can I speak to you in confidence?
22844,L141165,u713,m45,JAKE,Pretty much.
22845,L141164,u724,m45,SUITS,In over your head?
22846,L141163,u713,m45,JAKE,Pretty much.
22847,L141162,u724,m45,SUITS,Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
22848,L141161,u713,m45,JAKE,"Aces, Suits."
22849,L140934,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
22850,L140933,u713,m45,JAKE,Just a tip.
22851,L140884,u713,m45,JAKE,I try.
22852,L140883,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,"The King, huh? Nice going."
22853,L140811,u713,m45,JAKE,We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
22854,L140810,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
22855,L140805,u713,m45,JAKE,Confidence. It's just confidence.
22856,L140804,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,"You guys got sack, I'll give you that much."
22857,L140803,u713,m45,JAKE,Ten percent.
22858,L141621,u714,m45,KING PIN,Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
22859,L141620,u717,m45,LUPUS,"I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john."
22860,L141619,u714,m45,KING PIN,So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
22861,L141618,u717,m45,LUPUS,He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
22862,L141617,u714,m45,KING PIN,Speak.
22863,L141526,u717,m45,LUPUS,I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
22864,L141525,u714,m45,KING PIN,A Fed? Is he close?
22865,L141524,u717,m45,LUPUS,Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
22866,L140924,u714,m45,KING PIN,Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
22867,L140923,u717,m45,LUPUS,What?
22868,L141605,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,We're here.
22869,L141604,u719,m45,MOONAN,You guys awake?
22870,L141468,u719,m45,MOONAN,Let's just say he burned me once.
22871,L141467,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
22872,L141466,u719,m45,MOONAN,Did he buy it?
22873,L141260,u719,m45,MOONAN,"Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature."
22874,L141259,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --"
22875,L141085,u719,m45,MOONAN,"I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act."
22876,L141084,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?"
22877,L141074,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
22878,L141073,u719,m45,MOONAN,"Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him."
22879,L141070,u719,m45,MOONAN,You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
22880,L141069,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,Special Agent?
22881,L141652,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,Roger that.
22882,L141651,u719,m45,MOONAN,"He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig."
22883,L141258,u719,m45,MOONAN,"You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!"
22884,L141257,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,Whaddya mean? We got dick.
22885,L141256,u719,m45,MOONAN,"Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?"
22886,L141087,u719,m45,MOONAN,"Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?"
22887,L141086,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
22888,L141083,u719,m45,MOONAN,"Not everyone's on the take, Walter."
22889,L141082,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,That's it?
22890,L141081,u719,m45,MOONAN,Peace of mind.
22891,L141080,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,What do you get out of it?
22892,L141079,u719,m45,MOONAN,"You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it."
22893,L141078,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,What do you want?
22894,L141077,u719,m45,MOONAN,"Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His ""Fix."""
22895,L141072,u719,m45,MOONAN,"I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head."
22896,L141071,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,Who?
22897,L141603,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,Put your hand down. I don't high five.
22898,L141602,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,High five.
22899,L141601,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,What are you doing?
22900,L141600,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,I'm down!
22901,L141599,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,That's what I'm talking about.
22902,L141598,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,It's just insurance.
22903,L141597,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face."
22904,L141596,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,You trust this Moonan guy?
22905,L140943,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,"Whoa, whoa... There he is."
22906,L140942,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
22907,L140941,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
22908,L140940,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
22909,L140939,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns."
22910,L140938,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
22911,L140937,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,"Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand..."
22912,L140936,u723,m45,SOBOZINSKI,To who?
22913,L140935,u721,m45,ROTTOVICH,You sell it.
22914,L149002,u728,m46,JACK,A couple I know are getting married.
22915,L149001,u725,m46,BELLA,What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
22916,L148672,u725,m46,BELLA,You're all scumbags.
22917,L148671,u728,m46,JACK,"Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt."
22918,L148670,u725,m46,BELLA,"Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are."
22919,L148669,u728,m46,JACK,I don't know anything about it.
22920,L148668,u725,m46,BELLA,Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
22921,L148667,u728,m46,JACK,What are you talking about?
22922,L148666,u725,m46,BELLA,You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
22923,L148615,u725,m46,BELLA,Sorry.
22924,L148614,u728,m46,JACK,Ouch.
22925,L148613,u725,m46,BELLA,"Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? ""I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission."" The shit!"
22926,L148612,u728,m46,JACK,"Not like Matt, you mean."
22927,L148611,u725,m46,BELLA,"Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others."
22928,L148610,u728,m46,JACK,The Indian rope-trick.
22929,L148607,u725,m46,BELLA,"Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?"
22930,L148606,u728,m46,JACK,I despise the job.
22931,L148605,u725,m46,BELLA,I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
22932,L148604,u725,m46,BELLA,Well it is. But I know where I am.
22933,L148603,u728,m46,JACK,You called the casino a cesspit.
22934,L148602,u725,m46,BELLA,Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
22935,L148601,u728,m46,JACK,I can imagine.
22936,L148600,u725,m46,BELLA,I got scared.
22937,L148599,u728,m46,JACK,Why did you quit?
22938,L148598,u725,m46,BELLA,"But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing."
22939,L148596,u725,m46,BELLA,All men are cheats.
22940,L148595,u728,m46,JACK,I hate cheats.
22941,L148590,u728,m46,JACK,It's the tension.
22942,L148589,u725,m46,BELLA,You're shaking.
22943,L148580,u728,m46,JACK,Goodnight.
22944,L148579,u725,m46,BELLA,I'll take you up on that.
22945,L148578,u728,m46,JACK,Maybe another time.
22946,L148577,u725,m46,BELLA,My car's in the garage.
22947,L148576,u728,m46,JACK,No. Thanks.
22948,L148575,u725,m46,BELLA,Jack. Do you need a ride?
22949,L148394,u725,m46,BELLA,How do I look?
22950,L148393,u728,m46,JACK,Is it that bad?
22951,L148392,u725,m46,BELLA,"Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit."
22952,L148391,u728,m46,JACK,Jack Manfred.
22953,L148390,u725,m46,BELLA,I'm Bella.
22954,L148338,u726,m46,DEALER,Seven-fifty.
22955,L148337,u728,m46,JACK,Eight-fifty.
22956,L148336,u726,m46,DEALER,I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
22957,L148335,u728,m46,JACK,Is that your idea of arithmetic?
22958,L148334,u726,m46,DEALER,How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
22959,L148333,u728,m46,JACK,What?!
22960,L148332,u726,m46,DEALER,How about five hundred.
22961,L148331,u728,m46,JACK,How about fifteen hundred?
22962,L148328,u726,m46,DEALER,"That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition."
22963,L148327,u728,m46,JACK,What's the Blue Book price?
22964,L148326,u726,m46,DEALER,What kind of deal you looking to?
22965,L148829,u728,m46,JACK,"You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business."
22966,L148828,u727,m46,GILES,How's that football story corning along?
22967,L148827,u728,m46,JACK,Not entirely.
22968,L148826,u727,m46,GILES,"A bit unexpected, wasn't it?"
22969,L148825,u728,m46,JACK,She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
22970,L148824,u727,m46,GILES,And your lady?
22971,L148823,u728,m46,JACK,Not particularly.
22972,L148822,u727,m46,GILES,Good night?
22973,L148760,u727,m46,GILES,"Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work."
22974,L148759,u728,m46,JACK,Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
22975,L148758,u727,m46,GILES,I get it.
22976,L148736,u727,m46,GILES,Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
22977,L148735,u728,m46,JACK,Last hand.
22978,L148721,u728,m46,JACK,It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
22979,L148720,u727,m46,GILES,Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
22980,L148719,u728,m46,JACK,I don't gamble.
22981,L148710,u728,m46,JACK,She.
22982,L148709,u727,m46,GILES,Who was he?
22983,L148708,u728,m46,JACK,I found her in bed with someone.
22984,L148706,u728,m46,JACK,South African women are very sporty.
22985,L148705,u727,m46,GILES,"She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend."
22986,L148695,u727,m46,GILES,Looking forward!
22987,L148694,u728,m46,JACK,I'll try and make it.
22988,L148693,u727,m46,GILES,"Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room."
22989,L148692,u727,m46,GILES,My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
22990,L148691,u728,m46,JACK,Habib?
22991,L148690,u727,m46,GILES,"Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib."
22992,L148689,u728,m46,JACK,I'm working on that soccer story.
22993,L148688,u727,m46,GILES,I thought it was you. It's the hair!
22994,L148209,u727,m46,GILES,"We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?"
22995,L148208,u728,m46,JACK,"I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?"
22996,L148207,u727,m46,GILES,All right. As what?
22997,L148206,u728,m46,JACK,"I want a job, Giles."
22998,L148205,u727,m46,GILES,Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
22999,L148204,u728,m46,JACK,We all played the field.
23000,L148203,u727,m46,GILES,Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
23001,L148202,u728,m46,JACK,She went back to South Africa.
23002,L148201,u727,m46,GILES,What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
23003,L148200,u728,m46,JACK,"Three years, two months. March '93."
23004,L148923,u733,m46,MARION,How can anyone be that naive?
23005,L148922,u728,m46,JACK,I want to buy a car.
23006,L148921,u733,m46,MARION,What?
23007,L148920,u728,m46,JACK,I hate public transport.
23008,L148919,u733,m46,MARION,Why did you take the money?
23009,L148916,u733,m46,MARION,You're already alone.
23010,L148915,u728,m46,JACK,"Leave me alone, Marion."
23011,L148914,u733,m46,MARION,Here...use a spoon.
23012,L148913,u733,m46,MARION,"Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple."
23013,L148912,u728,m46,JACK,Then what?
23014,L148911,u733,m46,MARION,Nothing about you.
23015,L148910,u728,m46,JACK,Marion!  What did you tell the police?
23016,L148909,u733,m46,MARION,It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
23017,L148908,u728,m46,JACK,"There was a message, wasn't there?"
23018,L148907,u733,m46,MARION,I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
23019,L148903,u733,m46,MARION,I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
23020,L148902,u728,m46,JACK,How did you know I was here?
23021,L148890,u728,m46,JACK,Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
23022,L148889,u733,m46,MARION,Really?
23023,L148888,u728,m46,JACK,Gambling's not about money.
23024,L148887,u733,m46,MARION,"I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time..."
23025,L148886,u728,m46,JACK,Never. Why do you ask?
23026,L148885,u733,m46,MARION,Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
23027,L148844,u728,m46,JACK,Not talking. Writing.
23028,L148843,u733,m46,MARION,You were talking in your sleep.
23029,L148842,u728,m46,JACK,What?
23030,L148840,u728,m46,JACK,"Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!"
23031,L148839,u733,m46,MARION,You will?
23032,L148838,u728,m46,JACK,I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
23033,L148837,u733,m46,MARION,"It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong."
23034,L148836,u728,m46,JACK,You're entitled to your opinion.
23035,L148835,u733,m46,MARION,"-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?"
23036,L148834,u728,m46,JACK,"That girl, she works at the casino --"
23037,L148833,u728,m46,JACK,It will.
23038,L148832,u733,m46,MARION,I hope it brings you luck.
23039,L148831,u728,m46,JACK,It's beautiful. Thank you.
23040,L148665,u733,m46,MARION,No. Answer it!
23041,L148664,u728,m46,JACK,Leave it.
23042,L148663,u733,m46,MARION,"The door, Jack."
23043,L148661,u733,m46,MARION,Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
23044,L148660,u728,m46,JACK,"Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative."
23045,L148659,u733,m46,MARION,Without hope there's no point to anything.
23046,L148658,u728,m46,JACK,It's the truth.
23047,L148657,u733,m46,MARION,Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
23048,L148656,u728,m46,JACK,Marion. It's a book.
23049,L148655,u733,m46,MARION,I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
23050,L148654,u728,m46,JACK,"-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it."
23051,L148653,u733,m46,MARION,Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
23052,L148652,u728,m46,JACK,He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
23053,L148651,u733,m46,MARION,"I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic."
23054,L148650,u728,m46,JACK,Why not?
23055,L148649,u733,m46,MARION,I don't like it.
23056,L148529,u733,m46,MARION,"Well, that's our life now, isn't it?"
23057,L148528,u728,m46,JACK,I'm on at nine.
23058,L148527,u733,m46,MARION,I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
23059,L148526,u728,m46,JACK,What about a drink on the way home?
23060,L148525,u733,m46,MARION,What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
23061,L148524,u733,m46,MARION,Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
23062,L148523,u728,m46,JACK,You're my conscience.
23063,L148522,u733,m46,MARION,What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
23064,L148521,u728,m46,JACK,"Marion, stop this."
23065,L148520,u733,m46,MARION,"Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier."
23066,L148519,u728,m46,JACK,Do you have to swear all the time?
23067,L148518,u733,m46,MARION,This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
23068,L148517,u728,m46,JACK,Probably.
23069,L148516,u733,m46,MARION,Are you drunk?
23070,L148515,u728,m46,JACK,I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
23071,L148514,u733,m46,MARION,Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
23072,L148513,u728,m46,JACK,"Don't play the cop with me, Marion."
23073,L148512,u733,m46,MARION,Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
23074,L148451,u728,m46,JACK,I'll see you in my dreams.
23075,L148450,u733,m46,MARION,"When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep."
23076,L148449,u728,m46,JACK,It's only hair. I haven't changed.
23077,L148448,u733,m46,MARION,I loved it blond.
23078,L148447,u733,m46,MARION,Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
23079,L148446,u728,m46,JACK,Tension. It'll go.
23080,L148445,u733,m46,MARION,You're shaking. What is it?
23081,L148444,u728,m46,JACK,Fine.
23082,L148443,u733,m46,MARION,How did it go?
23083,L148442,u728,m46,JACK,I don't know.
23084,L148441,u733,m46,MARION,What's the time?
23085,L148381,u733,m46,MARION,You've got such beautiful hands.
23086,L148380,u728,m46,JACK,Are you trying to read my palm?
23087,L148378,u733,m46,MARION,"I love you Jack, you know that."
23088,L148377,u728,m46,JACK,There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
23089,L148376,u733,m46,MARION,You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
23090,L148373,u728,m46,JACK,I start Monday week.
23091,L148372,u733,m46,MARION,You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
23092,L148371,u728,m46,JACK,I had training. In the Republic.
23093,L148370,u733,m46,MARION,"450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?"
23094,L148369,u728,m46,JACK,It came my way. 450 a week.
23095,L148368,u733,m46,MARION,How did you land that?
23096,L148367,u728,m46,JACK,In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
23097,L148366,u733,m46,MARION,What job?
23098,L148365,u728,m46,JACK,I've got a job.
23099,L148364,u733,m46,MARION,I want to hear it.
23100,L148363,u728,m46,JACK,I've got something to tell you.
23101,L148362,u733,m46,MARION,You're my prisoner.
23102,L148358,u733,m46,MARION,Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
23103,L148357,u728,m46,JACK,"Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it."
23104,L148356,u733,m46,MARION,Take it back. Till you sell your book.
23105,L148355,u728,m46,JACK,I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
23106,L148354,u733,m46,MARION,You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
23107,L148353,u728,m46,JACK,I. sold the car.
23108,L148352,u733,m46,MARION,Where did you get it?
23109,L148350,u728,m46,JACK,Turn around.
23110,L148349,u733,m46,MARION,"It's not just inner beauty, is it?"
23111,L148348,u728,m46,JACK,You really are a beautiful woman.
23112,L148347,u733,m46,MARION,I won't be that long.
23113,L148346,u728,m46,JACK,You want me drunk?
23114,L148345,u733,m46,MARION,"No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer."
23115,L148344,u728,m46,JACK,You mean I won't resist them.
23116,L148343,u733,m46,MARION,I couldn't resist them.
23117,L148237,u728,m46,JACK,"I won't.  Goodbye, dad."
23118,L148236,u729,m46,JACK SR.,Don't let yourself down.
23119,L148235,u728,m46,JACK,"Yes, I know that."
23120,L148234,u729,m46,JACK SR.,"Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that"
23121,L148233,u728,m46,JACK,"So how are you doing, dad?"
23122,L148232,u728,m46,JACK,"All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him."
23123,L148231,u729,m46,JACK SR.,"For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion."
23124,L148227,u729,m46,JACK SR.,"I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break."
23125,L148226,u728,m46,JACK,It's not that.
23126,L148225,u729,m46,JACK SR.,"Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice..."
23127,L148223,u729,m46,JACK SR.,"Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier."
23128,L148222,u728,m46,JACK,No.
23129,L148221,u729,m46,JACK SR.,Found a job?
23130,L148220,u728,m46,JACK,Great.
23131,L148991,u730,m46,JANI,"Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you..."
23132,L148990,u728,m46,JACK,Did you solve your problems?
23133,L148989,u730,m46,JANI,"Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am."
23134,L148988,u728,m46,JACK,How are you?
23135,L148987,u730,m46,JANI,Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
23136,L148986,u728,m46,JACK,Jani! Where are you?
23137,L148985,u730,m46,JANI,Jack! It's Jani.
23138,L148984,u728,m46,JACK,Hello...
23139,L148867,u730,m46,JANI,It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
23140,L148866,u728,m46,JACK,I don't think we should meet again.
23141,L148865,u728,m46,JACK,No thank you.
23142,L148864,u730,m46,JANI,Would you like a drink?
23143,L148863,u730,m46,JANI,I took the bandage off yesterday.
23144,L148862,u728,m46,JACK,And your hand too.
23145,L148861,u728,m46,JACK,I've still got mine.
23146,L148860,u730,m46,JANI,"Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better."
23147,L148859,u728,m46,JACK,That bruise has cleared up nicely.
23148,L148858,u730,m46,JANI,"The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats."
23149,L148857,u728,m46,JACK,Yes.
23150,L148856,u730,m46,JANI,Do you?
23151,L148855,u728,m46,JACK,It's all relative.  I need the money too.
23152,L148854,u730,m46,JANI,"Well, life's not fair. We know that."
23153,L148853,u728,m46,JACK,It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
23154,L148852,u730,m46,JANI,Thank you.
23155,L148851,u728,m46,JACK,Yes.
23156,L148850,u730,m46,JANI,Is it yes?
23157,L148820,u730,m46,JANI,I have to take the car.
23158,L148819,u728,m46,JACK,What for?
23159,L148818,u730,m46,JANI,I'm sorry.
23160,L148817,u730,m46,JANI,"I told you, all bets are off."
23161,L148816,u728,m46,JACK,Did they tell you to sleep with me?
23162,L148815,u730,m46,JANI,Let it go.
23163,L148814,u728,m46,JACK,How much do you owe?
23164,L148811,u730,m46,JANI,"No, forget it. The bet's off."
23165,L148810,u728,m46,JACK,Wait a minute...
23166,L148809,u730,m46,JANI,I want you to forget what I said.
23167,L148806,u730,m46,JANI,"I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend."
23168,L148805,u728,m46,JACK,"I can't do it, Jani."
23169,L148804,u730,m46,JANI,"I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean."
23170,L148803,u728,m46,JACK,What about my neck?
23171,L148802,u730,m46,JANI,Next time it'll be my neck.
23172,L148800,u728,m46,JACK,Reynolds? You've done your research.
23173,L148799,u730,m46,JANI,"These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you."
23174,L148798,u728,m46,JACK,What ten thousand pounds?
23175,L148797,u730,m46,JANI,You keep the ten thousand pounds.
23176,L148796,u728,m46,JACK,But if it does.
23177,L148795,u730,m46,JANI,It won't.
23178,L148794,u728,m46,JACK,What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
23179,L148793,u730,m46,JANI,I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
23180,L148792,u728,m46,JACK,And I thought you were only after my body.
23181,L148791,u730,m46,JANI,"You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all."
23182,L148790,u728,m46,JACK,You're serious.
23183,L148789,u730,m46,JANI,"You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen."
23184,L148788,u728,m46,JACK,Robbery's not criminal?
23185,L148787,u730,m46,JANI,Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
23186,L148786,u728,m46,JACK,And I thought you were a bright woman.
23187,L148785,u730,m46,JANI,"The point is, they want a man inside."
23188,L148784,u728,m46,JACK,"Forget it, Jani. It'll never work."
23189,L148783,u730,m46,JANI,"My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -"
23190,L148782,u728,m46,JACK,Who's they?
23191,L148781,u730,m46,JANI,They mean it.
23192,L148779,u730,m46,JANI,"Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion."
23193,L148778,u728,m46,JACK,I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
23194,L148777,u730,m46,JANI,I know that. But you can now.
23195,L148776,u728,m46,JACK,Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
23196,L148775,u730,m46,JANI,I owe a lot of money.
23197,L148774,u728,m46,JACK,What kind of trouble?
23198,L148773,u730,m46,JANI,I'm in trouble.
23199,L148770,u728,m46,JACK,Then you're not a pro.
23200,L148769,u730,m46,JANI,I didn't.
23201,L148768,u728,m46,JACK,"It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it."
23202,L148767,u730,m46,JANI,"That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before."
23203,L148766,u728,m46,JACK,You choose.
23204,L148765,u730,m46,JANI,Which side do you like?
23205,L148764,u730,m46,JANI,"You don't like cheats, do you."
23206,L148763,u728,m46,JACK,Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
23207,L148762,u730,m46,JANI,What happened?
23208,L148723,u728,m46,JACK,I'll watch.
23209,L148722,u730,m46,JANI,He doesn't gamble.
23210,L148703,u730,m46,JANI,That's fine.
23211,L148702,u728,m46,JACK,"Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room."
23212,L148701,u728,m46,JACK,Turn left ahead.
23213,L148700,u730,m46,JANI,Just an accident. Nothing.
23214,L148699,u728,m46,JACK,How did you hurt your hand?
23215,L148561,u728,m46,JACK,I don't gamble.
23216,L148560,u730,m46,JANI,Toss you for it.
23217,L148559,u728,m46,JACK,Absolutely not.
23218,L148558,u730,m46,JANI,I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
23219,L148556,u728,m46,JACK,"Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology."
23220,L148555,u730,m46,JANI,Do you believe in astrology?
23221,L148554,u728,m46,JACK,"We all came from Africa, supposedly."
23222,L148553,u730,m46,JANI,"That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?"
23223,L148552,u728,m46,JACK,And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
23224,L148551,u730,m46,JANI,And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
23225,L148550,u728,m46,JACK,The debts.
23226,L148549,u730,m46,JANI,I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
23227,L148548,u728,m46,JACK,Your father?
23228,L148547,u730,m46,JANI,Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
23229,L148546,u728,m46,JACK,In the casino.
23230,L148545,u730,m46,JANI,Near the casino.
23231,L148544,u728,m46,JACK,"I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast."
23232,L148543,u730,m46,JANI,"No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally"
23233,L148542,u728,m46,JACK,First visit to London?
23234,L148541,u730,m46,JANI,I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
23235,L148540,u728,m46,JACK,So why did you come to my casino?
23236,L148539,u730,m46,JANI,I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
23237,L148538,u728,m46,JACK,There's a casino in this hotel.
23238,L148537,u730,m46,JANI,To coincidence.
23239,L148535,u728,m46,JACK,Impossible to calculate.
23240,L148534,u730,m46,JANI,That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
23241,L148533,u728,m46,JACK,It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
23242,L148532,u730,m46,JANI,You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
23243,L148531,u728,m46,JACK,Oh hello.
23244,L148473,u730,m46,JANI,"Well, thank you anyway."
23245,L148472,u728,m46,JACK,I've lived there.
23246,L148471,u730,m46,JANI,You know where I'm from?
23247,L148470,u728,m46,JACK,"I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa."
23248,L148952,u728,m46,JACK,I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
23249,L148951,u736,m46,ROSS,You did?
23250,L148950,u728,m46,JACK,Of course I recognised him!
23251,L148943,u728,m46,JACK,Who did it? Tell me!
23252,L148942,u736,m46,ROSS,Ross.
23253,L148941,u728,m46,JACK,Who...
23254,L148940,u736,m46,ROSS,Detective Inspector Ross.
23255,L148973,u728,m46,JACK,Turn left at the lights.
23256,L148972,u731,m46,LUCY,Where to?
23257,L148971,u731,m46,LUCY,Too much. Eighteen hundred.
23258,L148970,u728,m46,JACK,Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
23259,L148969,u731,m46,LUCY,I might.
23260,L148968,u728,m46,JACK,Are you going to put a spell on me?
23261,L148967,u731,m46,LUCY,I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
23262,L148966,u728,m46,JACK,"And what do you do, Lucy?"
23263,L148965,u731,m46,LUCY,I'm Lucy.
23264,L148964,u728,m46,JACK,Have I?
23265,L148963,u731,m46,LUCY,You've been avoiding me.
23266,L148961,u734,m46,MATT,"Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!"
23267,L148960,u728,m46,JACK,I'd like to buy you a drink.
23268,L148959,u734,m46,MATT,"What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her."
23269,L148624,u734,m46,MATT,I'll tell you later.
23270,L148623,u728,m46,JACK,What happened to Bella?
23271,L148621,u734,m46,MATT,"Rough life, Jack."
23272,L148620,u728,m46,JACK,Rough day?
23273,L148574,u728,m46,JACK,Don't worry.
23274,L148573,u734,m46,MATT,I can't give you a lift back tonight.
23275,L148510,u728,m46,JACK,"""The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places."" Ernest Hemingway."
23276,L148509,u734,m46,MATT,"Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you."
23277,L148508,u728,m46,JACK,I'm off. I need to sleep.
23278,L148503,u728,m46,JACK,I don't gamble.
23279,L148502,u734,m46,MATT,"Don't worry, I won't report you!"
23280,L148501,u728,m46,JACK,No thanks.
23281,L148500,u734,m46,MATT,"Hey Jack, join us."
23282,L148499,u734,m46,MATT,That bitch? No.
23283,L148498,u728,m46,JACK,Does Bella come here?
23284,L148497,u734,m46,MATT,Good call. Help yourself.
23285,L148496,u728,m46,JACK,Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
23286,L148495,u734,m46,MATT,Just girls. What are you drinking?
23287,L148494,u728,m46,JACK,And the girls?
23288,L148493,u734,m46,MATT,Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
23289,L148492,u728,m46,JACK,Who are these guys?
23290,L148487,u734,m46,MATT,I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
23291,L148486,u728,m46,JACK,You're talking about complicity.
23292,L148485,u734,m46,MATT,"So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy."
23293,L148484,u728,m46,JACK,"Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that."
23294,L148483,u734,m46,MATT,"I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?"
23295,L148482,u728,m46,JACK,"If I see you do it again, I'll report it."
23296,L148481,u734,m46,MATT,"What are you, a cop?"
23297,L148480,u728,m46,JACK,I'm not going to report it.
23298,L148479,u734,m46,MATT,"I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong."
23299,L148478,u728,m46,JACK,That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
23300,L148477,u734,m46,MATT,What the fuck are you talking about?
23301,L148476,u728,m46,JACK,"Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating."
23302,L148440,u728,m46,JACK,Some other time.
23303,L148439,u734,m46,MATT,I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
23304,L148438,u728,m46,JACK,"No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours."
23305,L148437,u734,m46,MATT,I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
23306,L148436,u734,m46,MATT,"Not bad. I have other interests, of course."
23307,L148435,u728,m46,JACK,You've done pretty well.
23308,L148434,u734,m46,MATT,Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
23309,L148433,u728,m46,JACK,How long have you worked at the casino?
23310,L148432,u734,m46,MATT,She's my baby.
23311,L148431,u728,m46,JACK,Nice car.
23312,L148430,u734,m46,MATT,"So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high."
23313,L148429,u728,m46,JACK,Thanks.
23314,L148428,u734,m46,MATT,I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
23315,L148427,u734,m46,MATT,Have you got transport?
23316,L148426,u728,m46,JACK,Over the river.
23317,L148425,u734,m46,MATT,"Where do you live, Jack?"
23318,L148583,u732,m46,MAN,"It was you, you shit."
23319,L148582,u728,m46,JACK,Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
23320,L148581,u732,m46,MAN,You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
23321,L148460,u728,m46,JACK,"I'm afraid that's not so, sir."
23322,L148459,u732,m46,MAN,I put them on together.
23323,L148458,u728,m46,JACK,"You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet."
23324,L148457,u732,m46,MAN,"What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady."
23325,L148456,u728,m46,JACK,"I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet."
23326,L148926,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
23327,L148925,u728,m46,JACK,Bruised.
23328,L148924,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"How do you feel, Jack?"
23329,L148685,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,She was a real asset. But what could I do?
23330,L148684,u728,m46,JACK,A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
23331,L148683,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Thanks for the information.
23332,L148680,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,I can see.
23333,L148679,u728,m46,JACK,He's paying out in stacks of 25.
23334,L148423,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,He's a good customer.
23335,L148422,u728,m46,JACK,Does he win?
23336,L148421,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella."
23337,L148414,u728,m46,JACK,"All right, Mr Reynolds."
23338,L148413,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"Why don't you take a break, Jack."
23339,L148320,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"Jack, you're not the usual type we get here."
23340,L148319,u728,m46,JACK,I just want the job.
23341,L148316,u728,m46,JACK,Fine.
23342,L148315,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,That hair will have to go.
23343,L148314,u728,m46,JACK,Fine.
23344,L148313,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,You can start Monday week.
23345,L148311,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
23346,L148310,u728,m46,JACK,Very impressive.
23347,L148309,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again."
23348,L148308,u728,m46,JACK,No.
23349,L148307,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,She's not in the gaming business is she?
23350,L148306,u728,m46,JACK,Yes.
23351,L148305,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Girlfriend?
23352,L148304,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?"
23353,L148303,u728,m46,JACK,How?
23354,L148302,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
23355,L148301,u728,m46,JACK,Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
23356,L148300,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does."
23357,L148299,u728,m46,JACK,"We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check."
23358,L148298,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
23359,L148297,u728,m46,JACK,"I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds."
23360,L148296,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Ever?
23361,L148295,u728,m46,JACK,I don't gamble.
23362,L148294,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
23363,L148293,u728,m46,JACK,What for?
23364,L148292,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture."
23365,L148290,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,I said good call.
23366,L148289,u728,m46,JACK,You want me to check?
23367,L148288,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Good call.
23368,L148287,u728,m46,JACK,It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
23369,L148286,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,What makes you so sure?
23370,L148285,u728,m46,JACK,Five.
23371,L148284,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,I make it six.
23372,L148283,u728,m46,JACK,Five.
23373,L148282,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,How many aces are left?
23374,L148280,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,You won't. Not without permission.
23375,L148279,u728,m46,JACK,What happens if I want to sneeze?
23376,L148278,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched."
23377,L148277,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Wipe your hands.
23378,L148276,u728,m46,JACK,I don't think so.
23379,L148275,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Haven't you forgotten something?
23380,L148270,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,They've been tested.
23381,L148269,u728,m46,JACK,Where's the magnet?
23382,L148268,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,We do.
23383,L148267,u728,m46,JACK,"You use two alternating, don't you?"
23384,L148263,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Give me 365.
23385,L148262,u728,m46,JACK,25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
23386,L148261,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Any exceptions?
23387,L148260,u728,m46,JACK,Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
23388,L148259,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
23389,L148258,u728,m46,JACK,Why four? And not three or five?
23390,L148257,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,We check every four days.
23391,L148256,u728,m46,JACK,I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
23392,L148254,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
23393,L148253,u728,m46,JACK,Do you have a Salon Prive?
23394,L148252,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
23395,L148251,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose."
23396,L148250,u728,m46,JACK,I was at Beadles.
23397,L148249,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,Where did you go to school?
23398,L148248,u728,m46,JACK,No.
23399,L148247,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?"
23400,L148246,u728,m46,JACK,Has he?
23401,L148245,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?"
23402,L148244,u728,m46,JACK,Jack.
23403,L148243,u735,m46,REYNOLDS,"David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John."
23404,L152367,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Yoo hoo, bomb..."
23405,L152366,u737,m47,BOILER,What the hell?
23406,L152348,u741,m47,PINBACK,It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
23407,L152347,u737,m47,BOILER,"What was that, I didn't hear..."
23408,L152341,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Doolittle, are you there?"
23409,L152340,u737,m47,BOILER,We've got to disarm the bomb.
23410,L152336,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Boiler, we're alive. My heart."
23411,L152335,u737,m47,BOILER,It didn't go off.
23412,L152334,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Oh, God..."
23413,L152333,u737,m47,BOILER,It didn't go off.
23414,L152324,u741,m47,PINBACK,"We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die."
23415,L152323,u737,m47,BOILER,Where is the key?
23416,L152322,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!"
23417,L152321,u737,m47,BOILER,"The key, goddamit, the key!"
23418,L152308,u737,m47,BOILER,"You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!"
23419,L152307,u741,m47,PINBACK,I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
23420,L152306,u737,m47,BOILER,Where is it? What did you do with it?
23421,L152305,u741,m47,PINBACK,The key!
23422,L152304,u737,m47,BOILER,Where's the fail-safe key?
23423,L152303,u741,m47,PINBACK,Key?
23424,L152302,u737,m47,BOILER,"No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!"
23425,L152301,u741,m47,PINBACK,Key? Key? What is the key?
23426,L152300,u737,m47,BOILER,The key!
23427,L152281,u741,m47,PINBACK,I think he's talking to it.
23428,L152280,u737,m47,BOILER,What's he doin'?
23429,L152262,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Look, bomb..."
23430,L152261,u737,m47,BOILER,"I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand."
23431,L152180,u741,m47,PINBACK,Eventual supernova.
23432,L152179,u737,m47,BOILER,"There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --"
23433,L152164,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?"
23434,L152163,u737,m47,BOILER,Yeah.
23435,L152162,u741,m47,PINBACK,I hope it's not the oven again.
23436,L152161,u737,m47,BOILER,"I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though."
23437,L152160,u741,m47,PINBACK,Oh. What's wrong now?
23438,L152159,u737,m47,BOILER,"The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero."
23439,L152158,u741,m47,PINBACK,What flickering light?
23440,L152157,u737,m47,BOILER,I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
23441,L152071,u741,m47,PINBACK,I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
23442,L152070,u737,m47,BOILER,"Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical."
23443,L152061,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Right, that checks out here."
23444,L152060,u737,m47,BOILER,I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
23445,L152351,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Talby, can you read me?"
23446,L152350,u737,m47,BOILER,Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
23447,L152349,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Talby, Talby, can you read me?"
23448,L152216,u737,m47,BOILER,-- open quantum latches --
23449,L152215,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Rechannel all safety relays --
23450,L152206,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,I read the same here.
23451,L152205,u737,m47,BOILER,Quantum is up thirty-five.
23452,L152175,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"He just likes it up in the dome, that's all."
23453,L152174,u737,m47,BOILER,Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
23454,L152125,u737,m47,BOILER,"Pinback, throw me the chart log."
23455,L152124,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
23456,L152123,u737,m47,BOILER,"Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star."
23457,L152105,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
23458,L152104,u737,m47,BOILER,"All right, then..."
23459,L152103,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
23460,L152102,u737,m47,BOILER,"Well, there's the possibility of..."
23461,L152101,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
23462,L152100,u737,m47,BOILER,"Well, it is kind of a long shot..."
23463,L152099,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Fuck that shit.
23464,L152098,u737,m47,BOILER,"Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula..."
23465,L152097,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Find me something, I don't care where it is."
23466,L152096,u737,m47,BOILER,Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
23467,L152095,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?"
23468,L152073,u737,m47,BOILER,Time to start talking.
23469,L152072,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven."
23470,L152089,u741,m47,PINBACK,Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
23471,L152088,u738,m47,BOMB #19,Thanks.
23472,L152087,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck."
23473,L152086,u738,m47,BOMB #19,Armed.
23474,L152085,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Arm yourself, bomb."
23475,L152084,u738,m47,BOMB #19,Check at six minutes.
23476,L152083,u741,m47,PINBACK,"All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?"
23477,L152082,u738,m47,BOMB #19,"Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds."
23478,L152081,u741,m47,PINBACK,Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
23479,L152080,u738,m47,BOMB #19,Energy shielding positive function.
23480,L152079,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?"
23481,L152371,u739,m47,BOMB #20,And I saw that I was alone.
23482,L152370,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Hey, bomb..."
23483,L152365,u739,m47,BOMB #20,"In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void."

23485,L152361,u741,m47,PINBACK,Bomb?
23486,L152360,u739,m47,BOMB #20,The only thing which exists is myself.
23487,L152359,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Hey, bomb."
23488,L152358,u739,m47,BOMB #20,False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
23489,L152357,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Hello, bomb."
23490,L152356,u739,m47,BOMB #20,"Therefore, I shall ignore you."
23491,L152355,u741,m47,PINBACK,Huh?
23492,L152354,u739,m47,BOMB #20,You are false data.
23493,L152260,u739,m47,BOMB #20,No.
23494,L152259,u741,m47,PINBACK,"You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?"
23495,L152258,u739,m47,BOMB #20,I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
23496,L152257,u741,m47,PINBACK,But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
23497,L152204,u739,m47,BOMB #20,Thanks.
23498,L152203,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck."
23499,L152197,u739,m47,BOMB #20,Armed.
23500,L152196,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself."

23508,L152330,u739,m47,BOMB #20,I have no proof that it was false data.
23509,L152329,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
23510,L152328,u739,m47,BOMB #20,...nine seconds...
23511,L152327,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,So if you detonate in...
23512,L152326,u739,m47,BOMB #20,Hmmm...
23513,L152325,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate."
23514,L152320,u739,m47,BOMB #20,"True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this."
23515,L152319,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality."
23516,L152318,u739,m47,BOMB #20,I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
23517,L152317,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
23518,L152316,u739,m47,BOMB #20,"Yes, well..."
23519,L152315,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe."
23520,L152314,u739,m47,BOMB #20,Of course not.
23521,L152313,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?"
23522,L152312,u739,m47,BOMB #20,That is correct.
23523,L152311,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"And you can only do it once, right?"
23524,L152310,u739,m47,BOMB #20,"To explode, of course."
23525,L152309,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?"
23526,L152299,u739,m47,BOMB #20,Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
23527,L152298,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Why don't you have more time?
23528,L152297,u739,m47,BOMB #20,Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
23529,L152296,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,That's it.
23530,L152295,u739,m47,BOMB #20,"Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain."
23531,L152294,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Exactly.
23532,L152293,u739,m47,BOMB #20,"In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections."
23533,L152292,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
23534,L152291,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?"
23535,L152290,u739,m47,BOMB #20,This is fun.
23536,L152289,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Right!
23537,L152288,u739,m47,BOMB #20,My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
23538,L152287,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?"
23539,L152286,u739,m47,BOMB #20,"Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am."
23540,L152285,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
23541,L152284,u739,m47,BOMB #20,It is intuitively obvious.
23542,L152283,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,But how do you know you exist?
23543,L152282,u739,m47,BOMB #20,Well of course I exist.
23544,L152279,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?"
23545,L152278,u739,m47,BOMB #20,I am always receptive to suggestions.
23546,L152277,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
23547,L152276,u739,m47,BOMB #20,Of course.
23548,L152275,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Hello, bomb, are you with me?"
23549,L152226,u739,m47,BOMB #20,"I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time."
23550,L152225,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order."
23551,L152224,u739,m47,BOMB #20,I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
23552,L152223,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?"
23553,L152346,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
23554,L152345,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?"
23555,L152344,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Hello, Pinback, are you there?"
23556,L152343,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Oh, sure."
23557,L152342,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
23558,L152221,u741,m47,PINBACK,"5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!"
23559,L152220,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,-- Remark.
23560,L152219,u741,m47,PINBACK,-- automatic channels open --
23561,L152218,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,-- remove thrust drive repellant --
23562,L152217,u741,m47,PINBACK,-- open circuit breakers --
23563,L152214,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Ah, negative drop."
23564,L152213,u741,m47,PINBACK,Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
23565,L152168,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Who cares?
23566,L152167,u741,m47,PINBACK,Veil nebula.
23567,L152166,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Out where?
23568,L152165,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?"
23569,L152122,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,I hereby name this star Fred.
23570,L152121,u741,m47,PINBACK,Wha?
23571,L152120,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Fred.
23572,L152119,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Come on, Doolittle, give it a name."
23573,L152118,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Commander Powell is dead.
23574,L152117,u741,m47,PINBACK,Commander Powell would have named it.
23575,L152116,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Who cares. Don't bother me.
23576,L152115,u741,m47,PINBACK,The new star. What are you gonna name it?
23577,L152114,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,What?
23578,L152113,u741,m47,PINBACK,What are you gonna name it?
23579,L152112,u741,m47,PINBACK,Naah. All stable.
23580,L152111,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Any of 'em any good?
23581,L152110,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Yeah. Eight, it says here."
23582,L152109,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Any planets?
23583,L152108,u741,m47,PINBACK,Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
23584,L152107,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Which one?
23585,L152106,u741,m47,PINBACK,"New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout."
23586,L152069,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?"
23587,L152068,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,In a second.
23588,L152067,u741,m47,PINBACK,I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
23589,L152066,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Yes.
23590,L152065,u741,m47,PINBACK,Doolittle...
23591,L152064,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
23592,L152063,u741,m47,PINBACK,"Yes, Doolittle."
23593,L152062,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Pinback...
23594,L152059,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,I'll check it.
23595,L152058,u741,m47,PINBACK,I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
23596,L152051,u741,m47,PINBACK,I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
23597,L152050,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?"
23598,L152049,u741,m47,PINBACK,Mafhkin oble groop...
23599,L152048,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?"
23600,L152393,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me."
23601,L152392,u743,m47,TALBY,"Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle."
23602,L152391,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Yeah?
23603,L152390,u743,m47,TALBY,"I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle..."
23604,L152389,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,No kidding?
23605,L152388,u743,m47,TALBY,"It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said."
23606,L152387,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Phoenix?
23607,L152386,u743,m47,TALBY,Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
23608,L152385,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Oh yeah?
23609,L152383,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Guess you're right.
23610,L152382,u743,m47,TALBY,"When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star..."
23611,L152381,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it."
23612,L152378,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!"
23613,L152377,u743,m47,TALBY,"What happened, Doolittle?"
23614,L152376,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone."
23615,L152375,u743,m47,TALBY,"Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?"
23616,L152363,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Calm down, Talby. I'm coming."
23617,L152362,u743,m47,TALBY,Doolittle! Help me.
23618,L152191,u743,m47,TALBY,"Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --"
23619,L152190,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Not now!
23620,L152189,u743,m47,TALBY,"Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock..."
23621,L152188,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Sh, Talby, don't bother me now."
23622,L152187,u743,m47,TALBY,"Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?"
23623,L152173,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up."
23624,L152172,u743,m47,TALBY,"Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it."
23625,L152171,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Yes, Talby, what is it?"
23626,L152170,u743,m47,TALBY,"Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?"
23627,L152156,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
23628,L152155,u743,m47,TALBY,I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
23629,L152154,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
23630,L152153,u743,m47,TALBY,"Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is."
23631,L152152,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
23632,L152151,u743,m47,TALBY,...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
23633,L152150,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
23634,L152149,u743,m47,TALBY,I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
23635,L152148,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
23636,L152147,u743,m47,TALBY,"Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems..."
23637,L152146,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer."
23638,L152145,u743,m47,TALBY,I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
23639,L152144,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself..."
23640,L152143,u743,m47,TALBY,"I'm getting something here, on this readout..."
23641,L152142,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"You know what I think about, Talby?"
23642,L152141,u743,m47,TALBY,"They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids..."
23643,L152140,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
23644,L152139,u743,m47,TALBY,"You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now..."
23645,L152138,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around..."
23646,L152137,u743,m47,TALBY,"...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters..."
23647,L152136,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship..."
23648,L152135,u743,m47,TALBY,"I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here..."
23649,L152134,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Must get lonely being up here so much.
23650,L152133,u743,m47,TALBY,I like it up here.
23651,L152132,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here."
23652,L152057,u743,m47,TALBY,"Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute."
23653,L152056,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,I need a diameter approximation.
23654,L152055,u743,m47,TALBY,"Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?"
23655,L152054,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,TALBY!
23656,L152380,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Yeah, the skipper always was lucky."
23657,L152379,u742,m47,POWELL,"Men... men... what happened, men?"
23658,L152272,u742,m47,POWELL,Phenomenology...
23659,L152271,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Sir?
23660,L152270,u742,m47,POWELL,"No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle."
23661,L152269,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now."
23662,L152268,u742,m47,POWELL,Talk to the bomb.
23663,L152267,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Sir?
23664,L152266,u742,m47,POWELL,"Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it."
23665,L152265,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"We're running out of time, sir."
23666,L152264,u742,m47,POWELL,"Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking."
23667,L152263,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Commander? Are you still there?
23668,L152256,u742,m47,POWELL,"Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think..."
23669,L152255,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?"
23670,L152254,u742,m47,POWELL,Sorry.
23671,L152253,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute."
23672,L152252,u742,m47,POWELL,"Doolittle, hello?"
23673,L152251,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Commander Powell? Commander, hello!"
23674,L152250,u742,m47,POWELL,"Well, what you might try is --"
23675,L152249,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"What should we do, sir? The time is running out."
23676,L152248,u742,m47,POWELL,"Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much."
23677,L152247,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"That's correct, sir."
23678,L152246,u742,m47,POWELL,It didn't work?
23679,L152245,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Negative effect.
23680,L152244,u742,m47,POWELL,"What was that, Doolittle?"
23681,L152243,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,Yes sir. Negative effect.
23682,L152242,u742,m47,POWELL,"Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?"
23683,L152241,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop."
23684,L152240,u742,m47,POWELL,"Ah... pity, pity..."
23685,L152239,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago."
23686,L152238,u742,m47,POWELL,"Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?"
23687,L152237,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"What's that, sir?"
23688,L152236,u742,m47,POWELL,"Doolittle, you must tell me one thing."
23689,L152235,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes."
23690,L152234,u742,m47,POWELL,"I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me."
23691,L152233,u740,m47,DOOLITTLE,"Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something."
23692,L154570,u753,m48,MAX,This.
23693,L154569,u744,m48,BLONDE,"How I make my living, what's your point?"
23694,L154568,u753,m48,MAX,"Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?"
23695,L154567,u744,m48,BLONDE,"No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go."
23696,L154566,u753,m48,MAX,No?
23697,L154565,u744,m48,BLONDE,But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
23698,L154564,u753,m48,MAX,Yeah.
23699,L154563,u744,m48,BLONDE,"Oh, yeah?"
23700,L154562,u753,m48,MAX,Bruno's girlfriend.
23701,L154561,u744,m48,BLONDE,Who are you?
23702,L154664,u753,m48,MAX,"This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out."
23703,L154663,u745,m48,BRUNO,None of your business.
23704,L154662,u753,m48,MAX,Who's Camille?
23705,L154661,u745,m48,BRUNO,What the hell are you doing?
23706,L154660,u753,m48,MAX,"Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk."
23707,L154659,u753,m48,MAX,"He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance."
23708,L154658,u745,m48,BRUNO,But the boss knows I always been loyal.
23709,L154657,u753,m48,MAX,"This is what your life's worth, Bruno."
23710,L154656,u753,m48,MAX,I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
23711,L154655,u745,m48,BRUNO,How come I never hearda you before?
23712,L154654,u753,m48,MAX,"Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is."
23713,L154653,u745,m48,BRUNO,That's a lotta crap.
23714,L154652,u753,m48,MAX,"I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape."
23715,L154651,u745,m48,BRUNO,What're you talkin' about?
23716,L154650,u753,m48,MAX,"You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it."
23717,L154644,u745,m48,BRUNO,"You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap."
23718,L154643,u753,m48,MAX,See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
23719,L154642,u753,m48,MAX,"You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack."
23720,L154641,u745,m48,BRUNO,Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
23721,L154639,u745,m48,BRUNO,What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
23722,L154638,u753,m48,MAX,That's not why we're here.
23723,L154637,u745,m48,BRUNO,What?
23724,L154636,u753,m48,MAX,"Actually, that's not gonna be necessary."
23725,L154635,u745,m48,BRUNO,Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
23726,L154634,u753,m48,MAX,"I like to keep it professional, that's all."
23727,L154633,u745,m48,BRUNO,"Man, you got a bad attitude."
23728,L154632,u753,m48,MAX,Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
23729,L154631,u745,m48,BRUNO,"You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--"
23730,L154630,u753,m48,MAX,Yeah?
23731,L154629,u745,m48,BRUNO,"I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool."
23732,L154628,u753,m48,MAX,"Yeah, sure, I understand."
23733,L154627,u745,m48,BRUNO,"Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard."
23734,L154595,u753,m48,MAX,Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
23735,L154594,u745,m48,BRUNO,Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
23736,L154593,u753,m48,MAX,"Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in."
23737,L154592,u745,m48,BRUNO,No wire.
23738,L154575,u745,m48,BRUNO,Guess again.
23739,L154574,u753,m48,MAX,I'm on a break.
23740,L154573,u745,m48,BRUNO,Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
23741,L154172,u746,m48,DARREN,Where?
23742,L154171,u749,m48,KENDRA,Move it.
23743,L154163,u749,m48,KENDRA,No.
23744,L154162,u746,m48,DARREN,Can I say something in my defense?
23745,L154161,u749,m48,KENDRA,Leave.  Now.
23746,L154160,u746,m48,DARREN,Nothing happened between me and Tia.
23747,L154157,u749,m48,KENDRA,You know each other?
23748,L154156,u746,m48,DARREN,You didn't tell me you lived with her.
23749,L154155,u749,m48,KENDRA,Some of us are trying to sleep.
23750,L154055,u746,m48,DARREN,Could you give us a moment.
23751,L154054,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,"And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt."
23752,L154053,u746,m48,DARREN,"Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are."
23753,L154052,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,She was there...
23754,L154051,u746,m48,DARREN,Do you know why I went after Justine?
23755,L154050,u746,m48,DARREN,Justine was not an unwilling participant.
23756,L154049,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
23757,L154046,u746,m48,DARREN,You're not still pissed?
23758,L154045,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,You mean until you showed up?
23759,L154044,u746,m48,DARREN,"How're ya doin', Max."
23760,L154177,u753,m48,MAX,Don't look down.
23761,L154176,u746,m48,DARREN,But I'm afraid of--
23762,L154175,u753,m48,MAX,"Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops."
23763,L154174,u746,m48,DARREN,No way.
23764,L154173,u753,m48,MAX,Out there.
23765,L154170,u753,m48,MAX,No time.
23766,L154169,u746,m48,DARREN,Lemme put some clothes on.
23767,L154168,u746,m48,DARREN,What?  Where're we going?
23768,L154167,u753,m48,MAX,It's a sweep.  C'mon.
23769,L154166,u753,m48,MAX,Police drone.
23770,L154165,u746,m48,DARREN,What is it?
23771,L154154,u746,m48,DARREN,You're roommates?
23772,L154153,u753,m48,MAX,I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
23773,L154152,u746,m48,DARREN,What are you doing here?
23774,L154058,u746,m48,DARREN,I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
23775,L154057,u753,m48,MAX,I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
23776,L154056,u746,m48,DARREN,"I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away."
23777,L154048,u746,m48,DARREN,"It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense."
23778,L154047,u753,m48,MAX,Why would I be pissed?
23779,L154713,u747,m48,HERBAL,"Theo rode for this place a long time, man."
23780,L154712,u754,m48,NORMAL,"What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around."
23781,L153986,u754,m48,NORMAL,"Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions."
23782,L153985,u747,m48,HERBAL,"It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High."
23783,L153984,u754,m48,NORMAL,Which is none of your business...or mine.
23784,L153983,u747,m48,HERBAL,"Like de prophets say, ""Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."""
23785,L153982,u754,m48,NORMAL,"So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife."
23786,L153981,u747,m48,HERBAL,"Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?"
23787,L154491,u753,m48,MAX,I got overhead...
23788,L154490,u748,m48,INGA,"So Max, what do you do with all your money?"
23789,L154489,u748,m48,INGA,Am I?
23790,L154488,u753,m48,MAX,You're light a deuce.
23791,L154487,u753,m48,MAX,It's a rule.
23792,L154486,u748,m48,INGA,I'll make it worth your while.
23793,L154485,u753,m48,MAX,I don't get involved with guns.
23794,L154484,u748,m48,INGA,I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
23795,L154483,u753,m48,MAX,Later.
23796,L154482,u748,m48,INGA,I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
23797,L154481,u753,m48,MAX,I ain't mad at you...
23798,L154480,u748,m48,INGA,"Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times."
23799,L154479,u753,m48,MAX,A grand.
23800,L154478,u748,m48,INGA,What're you looking for?
23801,L154477,u753,m48,MAX,Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
23802,L154476,u748,m48,INGA,Same old story.  Not interested.
23803,L154475,u753,m48,MAX,Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
23804,L154474,u748,m48,INGA,Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
23805,L154473,u753,m48,MAX,I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
23806,L154472,u748,m48,INGA,Where'd you clip this?
23807,L154191,u753,m48,MAX,Every week.
23808,L154190,u749,m48,KENDRA,You didn't...
23809,L154189,u753,m48,MAX,Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
23810,L154188,u749,m48,KENDRA,What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
23811,L154179,u753,m48,MAX,"And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either."
23812,L154178,u749,m48,KENDRA,What a creep.
23813,L154159,u749,m48,KENDRA,Yech...
23814,L154158,u753,m48,MAX,"He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--"
23815,L153967,u753,m48,MAX,"Yeah, me too."
23816,L153966,u749,m48,KENDRA,"Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human."
23817,L153965,u753,m48,MAX,I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
23818,L154611,u753,m48,MAX,"Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy."
23819,L154610,u750,m48,LAUREN,Hello...
23820,L154609,u753,m48,MAX,"Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice..."
23821,L154557,u753,m48,MAX,Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
23822,L154556,u750,m48,LAUREN,What else can we do?
23823,L154555,u753,m48,MAX,We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
23824,L154554,u750,m48,LAUREN,"If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?"
23825,L154551,u753,m48,MAX,"Look, I'd really like to..."
23826,L154550,u750,m48,LAUREN,Can you help me get her back?
23827,L154549,u753,m48,MAX,Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
23828,L154547,u750,m48,LAUREN,"I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran..."
23829,L154546,u753,m48,MAX,I know.
23830,L154545,u750,m48,LAUREN,They took my daughter.
23831,L154544,u753,m48,MAX,Damn... Are you alright?
23832,L154123,u753,m48,MAX,SHHH!  Don't do that!
23833,L154122,u750,m48,LAUREN,Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
23834,L154621,u750,m48,LAUREN,There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.

23838,L154617,u750,m48,LAUREN,"Don't worry, I'm coming to get you."
23839,L154616,u758,m48,SOPHY,"Mommy, where are you?"
23840,L154615,u750,m48,LAUREN,Sophy?  Are you okay?
23841,L154442,u758,m48,SOPHY,Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
23842,L154441,u750,m48,LAUREN,Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
23843,L154440,u758,m48,SOPHY,"If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me."
23844,L154439,u750,m48,LAUREN,What makes you cry?
23845,L154438,u758,m48,SOPHY,Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
23846,L154437,u750,m48,LAUREN,No...
23847,L154436,u758,m48,SOPHY,Are we in some kind of trouble?
23848,L154435,u750,m48,LAUREN,Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
23849,L154434,u758,m48,SOPHY,But why can't we stay here?
23850,L154433,u750,m48,LAUREN,"I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--"

23868,L154733,u751,m48,LOGAN,It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
23869,L154732,u751,m48,LOGAN,Open it.
23870,L154731,u753,m48,MAX,What's this?
23871,L154730,u753,m48,MAX,"That's what soldiers do, right?"
23872,L154729,u751,m48,LOGAN,"On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won."
23873,L154728,u753,m48,MAX,"Well, not me personally."
23874,L154727,u751,m48,LOGAN,"I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out."
23875,L154726,u753,m48,MAX,You believe that?
23876,L154725,u751,m48,LOGAN,My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
23877,L154724,u753,m48,MAX,I'm sorry.
23878,L154723,u751,m48,LOGAN,Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
23879,L154722,u753,m48,MAX,"I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?"
23880,L154721,u751,m48,LOGAN,Somebody's got to.
23881,L154720,u753,m48,MAX,See you're back and still rocking the boat.
23882,L154471,u753,m48,MAX,That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
23883,L154470,u751,m48,LOGAN,"You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up."
23884,L154469,u753,m48,MAX,They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
23885,L154468,u753,m48,MAX,"They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean."
23886,L154467,u751,m48,LOGAN,"She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me."
23887,L154466,u753,m48,MAX,I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
23888,L154465,u751,m48,LOGAN,"So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down."
23889,L154464,u753,m48,MAX,"Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something."
23890,L154463,u751,m48,LOGAN,She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
23891,L154462,u753,m48,MAX,"That's low, but this effects me how exactly?"
23892,L154461,u751,m48,LOGAN,"The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area."
23893,L154460,u753,m48,MAX,I already don't like the sound of this.
23894,L154459,u751,m48,LOGAN,Your help.
23895,L154458,u753,m48,MAX,What's in it for you?
23896,L154457,u751,m48,LOGAN,"I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them."
23897,L154456,u753,m48,MAX,You said you could help.
23898,L154455,u751,m48,LOGAN,"Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best."
23899,L154454,u753,m48,MAX,"Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people."
23900,L154453,u751,m48,LOGAN,Hardly...
23901,L154452,u753,m48,MAX,Your basic hodge-podge.
23902,L154451,u751,m48,LOGAN,A girl.
23903,L154450,u753,m48,MAX,"Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of..."
23904,L154449,u751,m48,LOGAN,"The technical term for you is ""chimera""..."
23905,L154448,u753,m48,MAX,I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
23906,L154447,u751,m48,LOGAN,How much do you know?
23907,L154446,u753,m48,MAX,I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
23908,L154445,u751,m48,LOGAN,How well do you remember the lab?
23909,L154444,u753,m48,MAX,We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
23910,L154427,u751,m48,LOGAN,"The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from."
23911,L154426,u753,m48,MAX,Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
23912,L154425,u751,m48,LOGAN,"He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier."
23913,L154424,u753,m48,MAX,I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
23914,L154422,u753,m48,MAX,You did go through my stuff.
23915,L154421,u751,m48,LOGAN,L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
23916,L154420,u751,m48,LOGAN,"C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment."
23917,L154419,u753,m48,MAX,You lost me.
23918,L154418,u751,m48,LOGAN,The other one like you...
23919,L154417,u753,m48,MAX,The other ones?
23920,L154416,u751,m48,LOGAN,Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
23921,L154413,u751,m48,LOGAN,Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
23922,L154412,u753,m48,MAX,"Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?"
23923,L154410,u751,m48,LOGAN,"No, I meant this."
23924,L154409,u753,m48,MAX,"Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand."
23925,L154408,u751,m48,LOGAN,"C'mere, I want to show you something."
23926,L154407,u753,m48,MAX,You need to get out more.
23927,L154406,u751,m48,LOGAN,I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
23928,L154405,u753,m48,MAX,You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
23929,L154404,u751,m48,LOGAN,I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
23930,L154403,u753,m48,MAX,Yes on all counts.
23931,L154402,u751,m48,LOGAN,"Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--"
23932,L154399,u753,m48,MAX,We are not fine.
23933,L154398,u751,m48,LOGAN,"It's alright, Peter, we're fine."
23934,L154397,u753,m48,MAX,"Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this."
23935,L154396,u751,m48,LOGAN,"You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here."
23936,L154395,u753,m48,MAX,How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
23937,L154394,u751,m48,LOGAN,"That would be appropriate, yes."
23938,L154393,u753,m48,MAX,Am I s'posed to be grateful?
23939,L154392,u751,m48,LOGAN,"So saw my hands off, I left you a present."
23940,L154391,u753,m48,MAX,How do I know you didn't?
23941,L154390,u751,m48,LOGAN,You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
23942,L154389,u753,m48,MAX,Bent.
23943,L154388,u751,m48,LOGAN,Bent?
23944,L154387,u753,m48,MAX,Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
23945,L154386,u751,m48,LOGAN,Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
23946,L154385,u753,m48,MAX,You got a lotta nerve.
23947,L154384,u751,m48,LOGAN,It was open.
23948,L154383,u753,m48,MAX,"Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--"
23949,L154382,u751,m48,LOGAN,I'm not a half bad cook.
23950,L154381,u753,m48,MAX,I won't be staying.
23951,L154380,u751,m48,LOGAN,Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
23952,L154313,u751,m48,LOGAN,Yeah...
23953,L154312,u753,m48,MAX,Is the social studies class over for today?
23954,L154311,u751,m48,LOGAN,"You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse."
23955,L154310,u753,m48,MAX,"Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about."
23956,L154309,u751,m48,LOGAN,Something.
23957,L154308,u753,m48,MAX,So what are you gonna do about it?
23958,L154307,u751,m48,LOGAN,"People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't."
23959,L154306,u753,m48,MAX,You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
23960,L154305,u751,m48,LOGAN,"Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them."
23961,L154304,u753,m48,MAX,"So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?"
23962,L154303,u751,m48,LOGAN,"Fortunately, my needs are met in that department."
23963,L154302,u753,m48,MAX,"What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday."
23964,L154301,u751,m48,LOGAN,One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
23965,L154300,u753,m48,MAX,Girlfriend?
23966,L154299,u751,m48,LOGAN,Lauren's not my wife.
23967,L154298,u753,m48,MAX,How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
23968,L154297,u751,m48,LOGAN,Too early to tell.
23969,L154296,u753,m48,MAX,So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
23970,L154295,u751,m48,LOGAN,"Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me."
23971,L154294,u753,m48,MAX,Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
23972,L154293,u751,m48,LOGAN,Wasn't that hard.
23973,L154292,u753,m48,MAX,How'd you find me?
23974,L154290,u751,m48,LOGAN,The one you're wearing?
23975,L154289,u753,m48,MAX,Lemme get my coat.
23976,L154287,u751,m48,LOGAN,Can we go somewhere and talk?
23977,L154286,u753,m48,MAX,Sorry about your window.
23978,L154284,u751,m48,LOGAN,Logan Cale.
23979,L154283,u753,m48,MAX,"Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--"
23980,L154282,u751,m48,LOGAN,We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
23981,L154281,u753,m48,MAX,So this guy walks into a bar and says...
23982,L154144,u753,m48,MAX,"The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going."
23983,L154143,u751,m48,LOGAN,Who is...
23984,L154142,u753,m48,MAX,"No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast."
23985,L154141,u751,m48,LOGAN,"So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?"
23986,L154140,u753,m48,MAX,Whoever that is.
23987,L154139,u751,m48,LOGAN,"You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus."
23988,L154138,u751,m48,LOGAN,We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
23989,L154137,u753,m48,MAX,I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
23990,L154136,u751,m48,LOGAN,You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
23991,L154135,u753,m48,MAX,Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
23992,L154134,u751,m48,LOGAN,I was expecting someone else.
23993,L154133,u753,m48,MAX,First time I ever heard that.
23994,L154132,u751,m48,LOGAN,Thank God.
23995,L154131,u753,m48,MAX,Girl's gotta make a living.
23996,L154130,u751,m48,LOGAN,You're a thief?
23997,L154265,u751,m48,LOGAN,I'll wait.
23998,L154264,u754,m48,NORMAL,None.
23999,L154263,u751,m48,LOGAN,Any idea when she'll be back?
24000,L154262,u754,m48,NORMAL,Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
24001,L154260,u754,m48,NORMAL,Can't help you.
24002,L154259,u751,m48,LOGAN,I need to talk to her.
24003,L154258,u754,m48,NORMAL,"She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme."
24004,L154257,u751,m48,LOGAN,But she does work here?
24005,L154256,u754,m48,NORMAL,You don't want to.
24006,L154255,u751,m48,LOGAN,Know where I can find her?
24007,L154254,u754,m48,NORMAL,Ladies would be elsewhere.
24008,L154253,u751,m48,LOGAN,I'm looking for a lady who works here.
24009,L154361,u753,m48,MAX,And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
24010,L154360,u752,m48,LYDIA,I understand.
24011,L154359,u753,m48,MAX,"Say the words, ""I understand."""
24012,L154358,u752,m48,LYDIA,"Okay, okay."
24013,L154357,u753,m48,MAX,"Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?"
24014,L154356,u752,m48,LYDIA,"Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help..."
24015,L154354,u752,m48,LYDIA,Let go of my hand.
24016,L154353,u753,m48,MAX,This is not a place you wanna go.
24017,L154352,u752,m48,LYDIA,"Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are."
24018,L154351,u753,m48,MAX,I think you should go now.
24019,L154350,u752,m48,LYDIA,You're also a fool.
24020,L154349,u753,m48,MAX,Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
24021,L154348,u752,m48,LYDIA,"How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person."
24022,L154347,u753,m48,MAX,"Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month."
24023,L154346,u752,m48,LYDIA,Oh?
24024,L154345,u753,m48,MAX,"And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble."
24025,L154344,u752,m48,LYDIA,I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
24026,L154343,u753,m48,MAX,"Look, I don't know what you want--"
24027,L154342,u752,m48,LYDIA,He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
24028,L154341,u753,m48,MAX,How do I know you're telling the truth?
24029,L154340,u752,m48,LYDIA,"With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship."
24030,L154339,u753,m48,MAX,You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
24031,L154338,u752,m48,LYDIA,My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
24032,L154337,u753,m48,MAX,Who are you?
24033,L154336,u752,m48,LYDIA,To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
24034,L154335,u753,m48,MAX,What do you want?
24035,L154334,u752,m48,LYDIA,A friend of your fiance's.
24036,L154333,u753,m48,MAX,Who is it?
24037,L154676,u753,m48,MAX,I'm on my way.
24038,L154675,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
24039,L154674,u753,m48,MAX,Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
24040,L154673,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,Got a pencil?
24041,L154672,u753,m48,MAX,"Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day."
24042,L154669,u753,m48,MAX,Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
24043,L154668,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
24044,L154667,u753,m48,MAX,I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
24045,L154510,u753,m48,MAX,You and me both.
24046,L154509,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
24047,L154508,u753,m48,MAX,Bastard...
24048,L154507,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
24049,L154506,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,"I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can."
24050,L154505,u753,m48,MAX,You're crazy.
24051,L154504,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
24052,L154503,u753,m48,MAX,"Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations."
24053,L154502,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,"They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture."
24054,L154501,u753,m48,MAX,How's this about me?
24055,L154500,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
24056,L154499,u753,m48,MAX,Here's your money.
24057,L154498,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
24058,L154495,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
24059,L154494,u753,m48,MAX,As long as you're okay.
24060,L154115,u753,m48,MAX,More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
24061,L154114,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,"Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--"
24062,L154113,u753,m48,MAX,You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
24063,L154112,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,"They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--"
24064,L154111,u753,m48,MAX,What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
24065,L154110,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
24066,L154109,u753,m48,MAX,"She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming."
24067,L154108,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,"A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail..."
24068,L154107,u753,m48,MAX,Nothing on Hannah?
24069,L154106,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
24070,L154105,u753,m48,MAX,Then what?
24071,L154104,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,"Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine."
24072,L154102,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
24073,L154101,u753,m48,MAX,Thank you.
24074,L154100,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,"He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you."
24075,L154099,u753,m48,MAX,Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
24076,L154098,u753,m48,MAX,"Sorry, I was seven at the time."
24077,L154097,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,"I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers."
24078,L154096,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,Right here someplace.
24079,L154095,u753,m48,MAX,"My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?"
24080,L154094,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,"You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid."
24081,L154093,u753,m48,MAX,"Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here."
24082,L154092,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,You drive away business roarin' in like that.
24083,L154091,u753,m48,MAX,You did.
24084,L154090,u760,m48,VOGELSANG,I asked you to keep that thing outside.
24085,L154280,u753,m48,MAX,"But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario."
24086,L154279,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,"I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain."
24087,L154278,u753,m48,MAX,"Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie."
24088,L154277,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,Only one I can think of.
24089,L154276,u753,m48,MAX,They don't have a lot of moving parts.
24090,L154275,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,So are dogs.
24091,L154274,u753,m48,MAX,They're prisoners to their genes.
24092,L154273,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,Please...
24093,L154272,u753,m48,MAX,And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
24094,L154271,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,Friends don't help other friends cheat.
24095,L154270,u753,m48,MAX,And because he's my friend.
24096,L154269,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,Unlikely.
24097,L154268,u753,m48,MAX,"Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson."
24098,L154267,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
24099,L154089,u753,m48,MAX,It's a secret.
24100,L154088,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,Where?
24101,L154087,u753,m48,MAX,Gotta go.
24102,L154086,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
24103,L154085,u753,m48,MAX,A fog bank.
24104,L154084,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
24105,L154083,u753,m48,MAX,Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
24106,L154082,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,"Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?"
24107,L154081,u753,m48,MAX,A long time.
24108,L154080,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,How long you and me known each other?
24109,L154079,u753,m48,MAX,"If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking."
24110,L154078,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,You know what I'm saying.
24111,L154077,u753,m48,MAX,A little what?
24112,L154076,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
24113,L154075,u753,m48,MAX,Yeah.
24114,L154074,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
24115,L154073,u753,m48,MAX,No.
24116,L154072,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
24117,L154071,u753,m48,MAX,Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
24118,L154070,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,What?
24119,L154069,u753,m48,MAX,That's odd...
24120,L154062,u753,m48,MAX,I just don't go in with any expectations.
24121,L154061,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
24122,L154060,u753,m48,MAX,What guys do.  'Nother order.
24123,L154059,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
24124,L154005,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,"Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?"
24125,L154004,u753,m48,MAX,Straight.
24126,L154003,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,"Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--"
24127,L154002,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,"No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?"
24128,L154001,u753,m48,MAX,At least he didn't swing with your ride.
24129,L154000,u755,m48,ORIGINAL CINDY,Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
24130,L153999,u753,m48,MAX,"Morning, Sunshine..."
24131,L154625,u753,m48,MAX,"Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights."
24132,L154624,u757,m48,SONRISA,You get it when I get her.
24133,L154623,u753,m48,MAX,Can you put that in a bag or something?
24134,L154608,u753,m48,MAX,She's gonna want to hear for herself.
24135,L154607,u757,m48,SONRISA,She's got my word.
24136,L154606,u753,m48,MAX,She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
24137,L154605,u757,m48,SONRISA,Make the call.
24138,L154604,u753,m48,MAX,I have sincere eyes.
24139,L154603,u757,m48,SONRISA,And she bought that?
24140,L154602,u753,m48,MAX,"I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever."
24141,L154601,u757,m48,SONRISA,"So, how do you get the woman to come to me?"
24142,L154598,u757,m48,SONRISA,Pull the cash.
24143,L154597,u753,m48,MAX,"Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business."
24144,L154590,u753,m48,MAX,"What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?"
24145,L154589,u757,m48,SONRISA,Who are you?
24146,L154585,u753,m48,MAX,You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
24147,L154584,u757,m48,SONRISA,I actually know how this works.
24148,L154583,u753,m48,MAX,"Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service."
24149,L154582,u757,m48,SONRISA,Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
24150,L154581,u753,m48,MAX,"Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds."
24151,L154580,u757,m48,SONRISA,"Not right now?  Okay, when?"
24152,L154579,u753,m48,MAX,Not right now.
24153,L154578,u757,m48,SONRISA,I'll bet you can.  Sit.
24154,L154577,u753,m48,MAX,"Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues."
24155,L154209,u753,m48,MAX,You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
24156,L154208,u759,m48,THEO,Tell everybody hey.
24157,L154207,u753,m48,MAX,"Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go."
24158,L154206,u759,m48,THEO,What if he's on the level?
24159,L154205,u753,m48,MAX,Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
24160,L154204,u759,m48,THEO,"I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good."
24161,L154203,u753,m48,MAX,Probably a touch of what's going around.
24162,L154202,u759,m48,THEO,Feel like the dog's dinner.
24163,L154201,u753,m48,MAX,Playing hooky again?
24164,L153973,u759,m48,THEO,"You're the best, Maxie."
24165,L153972,u753,m48,MAX,"It's payday, need me to pick up your check?"
24166,L154524,u753,m48,MAX,Shut-up...
24167,L154523,u756,m48,SKETCHY,That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
24168,L154373,u753,m48,MAX,"Say the words, ""I understand."""
24169,L154372,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"Okay, okay, okay--"
24170,L154371,u753,m48,MAX,"You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?"
24171,L154370,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"True, but--"
24172,L154369,u753,m48,MAX,"None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't."
24173,L154368,u756,m48,SKETCHY,She was the one--
24174,L154367,u753,m48,MAX,You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
24175,L154366,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic."
24176,L154365,u753,m48,MAX,Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
24177,L154364,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes."
24178,L154363,u753,m48,MAX,Easy Sketchy.
24179,L154362,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"You rock, Max.  You... Rock..."
24180,L154328,u753,m48,MAX,You don't.
24181,L154327,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?"
24182,L154326,u753,m48,MAX,I'll give it my best shot.
24183,L154325,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh."
24184,L154324,u753,m48,MAX,And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
24185,L154323,u756,m48,SKETCHY,Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
24186,L154322,u753,m48,MAX,How'd you get her out of town?
24187,L154321,u756,m48,SKETCHY,I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
24188,L154320,u753,m48,MAX,"Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen."
24189,L154319,u756,m48,SKETCHY,But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
24190,L154318,u753,m48,MAX,--a philandering pig.
24191,L154317,u756,m48,SKETCHY,She tells you how I've been--
24192,L154316,u753,m48,MAX,You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
24193,L154315,u756,m48,SKETCHY,So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
24194,L154250,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that."
24195,L154249,u753,m48,MAX,And why should she?
24196,L154248,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again."
24197,L154247,u753,m48,MAX,What happens if you level with her?
24198,L154246,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out."
24199,L154245,u753,m48,MAX,Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
24200,L154244,u756,m48,SKETCHY,She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
24201,L154243,u753,m48,MAX,A toy?
24202,L154242,u756,m48,SKETCHY,I'm a toy to her.
24203,L154241,u753,m48,MAX,And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
24204,L154240,u756,m48,SKETCHY,Lydia.
24205,L154239,u753,m48,MAX,Does this person have a name?
24206,L154238,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us."
24207,L154237,u753,m48,MAX,"Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--"
24208,L154236,u756,m48,SKETCHY,Exactly.
24209,L154235,u753,m48,MAX,And you were a sympathetic ear.
24210,L154234,u756,m48,SKETCHY,Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
24211,L154233,u753,m48,MAX,Really?
24212,L154232,u756,m48,SKETCHY,I'm the victim here.
24213,L154231,u753,m48,MAX,Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
24214,L154230,u756,m48,SKETCHY,But there's another side--
24215,L154229,u753,m48,MAX,You left out condescending.
24216,L154228,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged."
24217,L154227,u753,m48,MAX,"Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending."
24218,L154226,u756,m48,SKETCHY,Max--
24219,L154225,u753,m48,MAX,"Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?"
24220,L154224,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially."
24221,L154223,u753,m48,MAX,I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
24222,L154221,u756,m48,SKETCHY,"Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max."
24223,L154220,u753,m48,MAX,"You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her."
24224,L154218,u753,m48,MAX,What's up?
24225,L154217,u756,m48,SKETCHY,We gotta talk.
24226,L154216,u753,m48,MAX,"Hey, Sketchy--"
24227,L154030,u756,m48,SKETCHY,But I'll take a rain check...
24228,L154029,u753,m48,MAX,"Right, the big one-oh."
24229,L154028,u756,m48,SKETCHY,I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
24230,L154027,u753,m48,MAX,Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
24231,L154018,u756,m48,SKETCHY,Later.
24232,L154017,u753,m48,MAX,Catch you back at the wall.
24233,L154521,u753,m48,MAX,Theo's dead.
24234,L154520,u754,m48,NORMAL,"Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might."
24235,L154332,u753,m48,MAX,I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
24236,L154331,u754,m48,NORMAL,What about this?
24237,L154330,u753,m48,MAX,Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
24238,L154329,u754,m48,NORMAL,"Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already."
24239,L153998,u753,m48,MAX,"I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job."
24240,L153997,u754,m48,NORMAL,You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
24241,L153996,u753,m48,MAX,How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
24242,L153995,u754,m48,NORMAL,For a change.
24243,L153994,u753,m48,MAX,He's sick.
24244,L153993,u754,m48,NORMAL,And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
24245,L153992,u753,m48,MAX,I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
24246,L153991,u754,m48,NORMAL,More like deployed in bed asleep.
24247,L153990,u753,m48,MAX,What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
24248,L153989,u754,m48,NORMAL,I want you on call here.
24249,L153988,u753,m48,MAX,I was on call.
24250,L153987,u754,m48,NORMAL,This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
24251,L163309,u761,m49,AMANDA,"I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer."
24252,L163308,u765,m49,HAWK,"Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me."
24253,L163270,u765,m49,HAWK,"Well, shame on him if he doesn't."
24254,L163269,u761,m49,AMANDA,"He's a little spoiled, but I know he does."
24255,L163268,u765,m49,HAWK,"And he loves you back, doesn't he?"
24256,L163267,u761,m49,AMANDA,More than anything in the world.
24257,L163266,u765,m49,HAWK,"No, I mean... you love your son?"
24258,L163265,u761,m49,AMANDA,"I just told you, he's a big, hairy..."
24259,L163264,u765,m49,HAWK,You love him?
24260,L163263,u761,m49,AMANDA,"Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick."
24261,L163262,u765,m49,HAWK,"Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?"
24262,L163259,u765,m49,HAWK,"My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw..."
24263,L163258,u761,m49,AMANDA,Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
24264,L163257,u765,m49,HAWK,Who's Whiskey Dick?
24265,L163256,u761,m49,AMANDA,"Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?"
24266,L163255,u765,m49,HAWK,Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
24267,L163254,u761,m49,AMANDA,Gin.
24268,L163253,u765,m49,HAWK,What the hell is that?
24269,L163191,u761,m49,AMANDA,I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
24270,L163190,u765,m49,HAWK,Huh?
24271,L163189,u761,m49,AMANDA,"Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities."
24272,L163188,u765,m49,HAWK,"Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore."
24273,L163187,u761,m49,AMANDA,You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
24274,L163186,u765,m49,HAWK,"Thanks, miss."
24275,L163145,u762,m49,BARTENDER,"Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more."
24276,L163144,u765,m49,HAWK,I-I c-can't...
24277,L163143,u762,m49,BARTENDER,"You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything."
24278,L163142,u765,m49,HAWK,"Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't..."
24279,L163089,u762,m49,BARTENDER,"Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games."
24280,L163088,u765,m49,HAWK,Whoa... she is a killer.
24281,L163087,u762,m49,BARTENDER,"Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love."
24282,L163086,u765,m49,HAWK,"Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all."
24283,L163085,u762,m49,BARTENDER,You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
24284,L163084,u765,m49,HAWK,What's that?
24285,L163081,u765,m49,HAWK,"Yeah, a man's drink..."
24286,L163080,u762,m49,BARTENDER,You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
24287,L163079,u765,m49,HAWK,Got any KISS?
24288,L163078,u762,m49,BARTENDER,"Pick a song, Hawk."
24289,L163077,u765,m49,HAWK,Hawk.
24290,L163076,u762,m49,BARTENDER,"You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?"
24291,L163307,u766,m49,JAM,Bye.
24292,L163306,u763,m49,BETH,Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
24293,L163305,u766,m49,JAM,Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
24294,L163304,u763,m49,BETH,"Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam."
24295,L163303,u766,m49,JAM,"I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted."
24296,L163302,u763,m49,BETH,"That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?"
24297,L163301,u766,m49,JAM,"Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time."
24298,L163300,u763,m49,BETH,"Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?"
24299,L163221,u763,m49,BETH,"My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out."
24300,L163220,u766,m49,JAM,Ann Arbor?
24301,L163219,u763,m49,BETH,"I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here."
24302,L163218,u766,m49,JAM,"Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?"
24303,L163217,u763,m49,BETH,"Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?"
24304,L163216,u766,m49,JAM,I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
24305,L163215,u763,m49,BETH,"So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?"
24306,L163182,u763,m49,BETH,"Oh, screw it!"
24307,L163181,u766,m49,JAM,"Right, slow..."
24308,L163180,u763,m49,BETH,We've got to take this slow...
24309,L163179,u763,m49,BETH,You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
24310,L163178,u766,m49,JAM,"Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name."
24311,L163177,u763,m49,BETH,"I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it."
24312,L163176,u766,m49,JAM,I don't care. I wanna hear more.
24313,L163175,u763,m49,BETH,I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
24314,L163172,u763,m49,BETH,Believe it.
24315,L163171,u766,m49,JAM,Beth? I can't believe it.
24316,L162700,u766,m49,JAM,Yeah?
24317,L162699,u763,m49,BETH,Jeremiah?
24318,L162698,u766,m49,JAM,It's okay.
24319,L162697,u763,m49,BETH,Sorry.
24320,L162690,u766,m49,JAM,Thanks.
24321,L162689,u763,m49,BETH,No problem.
24322,L162945,u775,m49,TRIP,Whatever... stella.
24323,L162944,u764,m49,CHRISTINE,"Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere."
24324,L162943,u775,m49,TRIP,"You got in the car, didn't you?"
24325,L162942,u764,m49,CHRISTINE,Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
24326,L162939,u764,m49,CHRISTINE,What? That's disgusting!
24327,L162938,u775,m49,TRIP,"So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?"
24328,L162933,u764,m49,CHRISTINE,What the hell is that supposed to mean?
24329,L162932,u775,m49,TRIP,What's it worth to you?
24330,L162931,u764,m49,CHRISTINE,"Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?"
24331,L163339,u775,m49,TRIP,"Plenty, but it was all bad."
24332,L163338,u765,m49,HAWK,Any luck?
24333,L163034,u765,m49,HAWK,For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
24334,L163033,u775,m49,TRIP,One more time in English.
24335,L163032,u765,m49,HAWK,...at twenty-thirty hours.
24336,L163027,u765,m49,HAWK,"Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize."
24337,L163026,u775,m49,TRIP,"Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?"
24338,L163025,u765,m49,HAWK,So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
24339,L162998,u775,m49,TRIP,"Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?"
24340,L162997,u765,m49,HAWK,I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
24341,L162971,u775,m49,TRIP,"Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar..."
24342,L162970,u765,m49,HAWK,What was that D.J.'s name again?
24343,L162953,u775,m49,TRIP,Disco blows dogs for quarters.
24344,L162952,u765,m49,HAWK,You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
24345,L162864,u775,m49,TRIP,"Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's."
24346,L162863,u765,m49,HAWK,What's in Sandusky?
24347,L162862,u775,m49,TRIP,"Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk."
24348,L162861,u765,m49,HAWK,Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
24349,L162860,u775,m49,TRIP,I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
24350,L162791,u765,m49,HAWK,I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
24351,L162790,u775,m49,TRIP,"Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever."
24352,L162789,u765,m49,HAWK,"Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence."
24353,L162775,u765,m49,HAWK,"Our band ""Mystery"" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere."
24354,L162774,u775,m49,TRIP,Namely?
24355,L162770,u765,m49,HAWK,Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
24356,L162769,u775,m49,TRIP,"This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario."
24357,L162750,u765,m49,HAWK,Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
24358,L162749,u775,m49,TRIP,Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
24359,L162721,u765,m49,HAWK,For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
24360,L162720,u775,m49,TRIP,Yeah.
24361,L162719,u765,m49,HAWK,"What are you, high?"
24362,L163346,u765,m49,HAWK,Nah. Couldn't be.
24363,L163345,u768,m49,LEX,No... You don't think...?
24364,L163341,u765,m49,HAWK,Tickets?
24365,L163340,u768,m49,LEX,I found the Volvo.
24366,L163031,u765,m49,HAWK,"Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection..."
24367,L163030,u768,m49,LEX,"Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all ""re-enter"" the concerto. Voila!"
24368,L163029,u765,m49,HAWK,Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
24369,L163028,u768,m49,LEX,I think we should try sneaking in.
24370,L163020,u765,m49,HAWK,"Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five."
24371,L163019,u768,m49,LEX,"...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!"
24372,L163018,u765,m49,HAWK,"Cool, bro, now listen up..."
24373,L163017,u768,m49,LEX,"...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that..."
24374,L163016,u765,m49,HAWK,Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
24375,L163015,u765,m49,HAWK,"Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet."
24376,L163014,u768,m49,LEX,Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
24377,L163003,u768,m49,LEX,DUDES!
24378,L163002,u765,m49,HAWK,Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
24379,L163001,u768,m49,LEX,Uh... dudes?
24380,L162875,u768,m49,LEX,The paint!
24381,L162874,u765,m49,HAWK,What the fuck!
24382,L162859,u765,m49,HAWK,"Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed."
24383,L162858,u768,m49,LEX,"Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?"
24384,L162855,u765,m49,HAWK,Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
24385,L162854,u768,m49,LEX,We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
24386,L162820,u765,m49,HAWK,"Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think."
24387,L162819,u768,m49,LEX,"Now, how are we gonna do this?"
24388,L162795,u768,m49,LEX,Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
24389,L162794,u765,m49,HAWK,"Ok, dudes, follow my lead."
24390,L162793,u765,m49,HAWK,Curly.
24391,L162792,u768,m49,LEX,"Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something."
24392,L162788,u765,m49,HAWK,"Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?"
24393,L162787,u768,m49,LEX,"The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar"
24394,L162786,u765,m49,HAWK,"There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?"
24395,L162783,u765,m49,HAWK,"Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit."
24396,L162782,u768,m49,LEX,"Sunday, but..."
24397,L162781,u765,m49,HAWK,And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
24398,L162780,u768,m49,LEX,"Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati."
24399,L162779,u765,m49,HAWK,Damn straight we are.
24400,L162778,u768,m49,LEX,We are not stealing my mom's car.
24401,L162777,u765,m49,HAWK,"So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?"
24402,L162776,u768,m49,LEX,"But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!"
24403,L162754,u765,m49,HAWK,"Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off."
24404,L162753,u768,m49,LEX,Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
24405,L162740,u765,m49,HAWK,Weird...
24406,L162739,u768,m49,LEX,I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
24407,L162738,u765,m49,HAWK,Whoa... she just farted.
24408,L162737,u768,m49,LEX,I've been in love with her since the second grade.
24409,L162736,u765,m49,HAWK,That's Sherry VanHafton.
24410,L162726,u768,m49,LEX,Check!
24411,L162725,u765,m49,HAWK,Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
24412,L162678,u765,m49,HAWK,"Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them."

24416,L162667,u768,m49,LEX,Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
24417,L162666,u765,m49,HAWK,Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
24418,L162915,u767,m49,KENNY,Sure.
24419,L162914,u765,m49,HAWK,How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
24420,L162908,u767,m49,KENNY,"Oh, yeah...?"
24421,L162907,u765,m49,HAWK,Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.

24423,L162905,u765,m49,HAWK,"Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it."
24424,L162892,u765,m49,HAWK,"No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?"
24425,L162891,u767,m49,KENNY,Are you gettin' wise with me?
24426,L162882,u767,m49,KENNY,And if it ain't cleaned off?
24427,L162881,u765,m49,HAWK,Could be.
24428,L162877,u765,m49,HAWK,"Hey, disco dude, it's cool..."
24429,L162876,u767,m49,KENNY,"Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?"
24430,L163069,u773,m49,SCALPER,"Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?"
24431,L163068,u765,m49,HAWK,"Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man."
24432,L163067,u773,m49,SCALPER,"Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow."
24433,L163066,u765,m49,HAWK,"Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me."

24435,L163064,u765,m49,HAWK,I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
24436,L163063,u773,m49,SCALPER,"You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot."
24437,L163062,u773,m49,SCALPER,The easy way.
24438,L163061,u765,m49,HAWK,Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
24439,L163060,u773,m49,SCALPER,"Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy."
24440,L163059,u765,m49,HAWK,"Dude, this is all I got."
24441,L163357,u766,m49,JAM,"We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then."
24442,L163356,u765,m49,HAWK,"Go ahead, Jam."
24443,L163355,u766,m49,JAM,Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
24444,L163038,u765,m49,HAWK,"See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later."
24445,L163037,u766,m49,JAM,But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
24446,L163036,u765,m49,HAWK,"Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it."
24447,L163035,u766,m49,JAM,Wait! I know how we can get in!
24448,L163024,u765,m49,HAWK,"Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us."
24449,L163023,u766,m49,JAM,I got...
24450,L163013,u765,m49,HAWK,"Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm."
24451,L163012,u766,m49,JAM,"I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do."
24452,L163008,u765,m49,HAWK,"Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels."
24453,L163007,u766,m49,JAM,It was stolen!
24454,L162995,u765,m49,HAWK,"Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?"
24455,L162994,u766,m49,JAM,"Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize."
24456,L162993,u765,m49,HAWK,"Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense."
24457,L162969,u766,m49,JAM,"Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me."
24458,L162968,u765,m49,HAWK,"Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes."
24459,L162935,u765,m49,HAWK,Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
24460,L162934,u766,m49,JAM,It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
24461,L162926,u766,m49,JAM,"Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again."
24462,L162925,u765,m49,HAWK,"Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice."
24463,L162873,u765,m49,HAWK,"What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?"
24464,L162872,u766,m49,JAM,Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
24465,L162831,u766,m49,JAM,Check.
24466,L162830,u765,m49,HAWK,"If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?"
24467,L162686,u766,m49,JAM,Check.
24468,L162685,u765,m49,HAWK,All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
24469,L162684,u766,m49,JAM,Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
24470,L162681,u766,m49,JAM,She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
24471,L162680,u765,m49,HAWK,They're what?
24472,L162679,u766,m49,JAM,They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
24473,L162642,u766,m49,JAM,"Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school."
24474,L162641,u765,m49,HAWK,"Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?"
24475,L162640,u766,m49,JAM,"I'm really sorry about that, man."
24476,L162639,u765,m49,HAWK,Cool.
24477,L162635,u765,m49,HAWK,Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
24478,L162634,u766,m49,JAM,Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
24479,L162633,u765,m49,HAWK,"The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!"
24480,L162632,u766,m49,JAM,What's gone?
24481,L162631,u765,m49,HAWK,"Anyway, listen up. They're gone!"
24482,L162630,u766,m49,JAM,It's my Bullworker.
24483,L162629,u765,m49,HAWK,"Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana."
24484,L162628,u765,m49,HAWK,"Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary."
24485,L162627,u766,m49,JAM,Hawk?
24486,L162626,u765,m49,HAWK,"Jam, listen up."
24487,L163334,u766,m49,JAM,I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
24488,L163333,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
24489,L163043,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,"Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah."
24490,L163042,u766,m49,JAM,"Mom, what're we...?"
24491,L162747,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,"If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it."
24492,L162746,u766,m49,JAM,"I said, I'm sorry!"
24493,L162745,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,What?!
24494,L162744,u766,m49,JAM,"If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him."
24495,L162743,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,"Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you."
24496,L162713,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,"What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!"
24497,L162712,u766,m49,JAM,"You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?"
24498,L162711,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
24499,L162664,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,"You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome."
24500,L162663,u766,m49,JAM,Grounded for the rest of the year?
24501,L162662,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,"Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?"
24502,L162661,u766,m49,JAM,They're not idiots.
24503,L162659,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,"Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis."
24504,L162658,u766,m49,JAM,"But, mom!"
24505,L162657,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,"It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags."
24506,L162656,u766,m49,JAM,Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
24507,L162655,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
24508,L162654,u766,m49,JAM,"Ahh, sunshine."
24509,L162653,u766,m49,JAM,Uhh... nothing.
24510,L162652,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,"Jeremiah, what are you doing?"
24511,L162619,u771,m49,MRS. BRUCE,NOW!
24512,L162618,u766,m49,JAM,"Oh, hi, mom."
24513,L163235,u772,m49,PRIEST,Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
24514,L163234,u766,m49,JAM,Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
24515,L163233,u772,m49,PRIEST,A bustier?
24516,L163232,u766,m49,JAM,"No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that."
24517,L163231,u772,m49,PRIEST,Was it a teddy?
24518,L163230,u766,m49,JAM,"Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath."
24519,L163229,u772,m49,PRIEST,Well? Continue! Continue!
24520,L163228,u766,m49,JAM,"Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour."
24521,L163227,u772,m49,PRIEST,"Oh, this is terrible... Please go on."
24522,L163226,u766,m49,JAM,"I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me."
24523,L163225,u772,m49,PRIEST,No...
24524,L163224,u766,m49,JAM,"Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath."
24525,L163223,u772,m49,PRIEST,"Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute."
24526,L163170,u772,m49,PRIEST,"Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while."
24527,L163169,u766,m49,JAM,No.
24528,L163168,u772,m49,PRIEST,"Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?"
24529,L163167,u766,m49,JAM,Yeah.
24530,L163166,u772,m49,PRIEST,That's it?
24531,L163165,u766,m49,JAM,"So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together."
24532,L163139,u766,m49,JAM,"Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy."
24533,L163138,u772,m49,PRIEST,Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
24534,L163137,u766,m49,JAM,"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time."
24535,L163022,u768,m49,LEX,All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
24536,L163021,u775,m49,TRIP,Twenty-five more'n I got.
24537,L163011,u768,m49,LEX,"Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?"
24538,L163010,u775,m49,TRIP,"Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!"
24539,L163009,u768,m49,LEX,But we took the keys?
24540,L163006,u768,m49,LEX,"I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?"
24541,L163005,u775,m49,TRIP,It's gone.
24542,L162992,u775,m49,TRIP,"Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake."
24543,L162991,u768,m49,LEX,"Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?"
24544,L162963,u775,m49,TRIP,Let's lift up her shirt.
24545,L162962,u768,m49,LEX,"Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella."
24546,L162867,u768,m49,LEX,"Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!"
24547,L162866,u775,m49,TRIP,Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
24548,L162812,u768,m49,LEX,Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
24549,L162811,u775,m49,TRIP,"Well, here we are back at fucking school again."
24550,L162797,u768,m49,LEX,Hello summer detention.
24551,L162796,u775,m49,TRIP,About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
24552,L162785,u768,m49,LEX,Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
24553,L162784,u775,m49,TRIP,"Simplicity, Hawk."
24554,L162772,u775,m49,TRIP,"Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, ""Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole."" We're going this time and that's all there is to it."
24555,L162771,u768,m49,LEX,"The Chinese have a proverb: ""That which appears too good to be true, usually is."" There's gotta be a catch."
24556,L162767,u768,m49,LEX,We won?!
24557,L162766,u775,m49,TRIP,I did it! I did it! We won!
24558,L162733,u768,m49,LEX,"Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug."
24559,L162732,u775,m49,TRIP,"Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!"
24560,L162731,u768,m49,LEX,"Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out."
24561,L162730,u775,m49,TRIP,"Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!"
24562,L162729,u768,m49,LEX,"Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?"
24563,L162718,u775,m49,TRIP,"Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!"
24564,L162717,u768,m49,LEX,I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
24565,L162683,u768,m49,LEX,"If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!"
24566,L162682,u775,m49,TRIP,That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
24567,L162671,u775,m49,TRIP,You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
24568,L162670,u768,m49,LEX,"Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass."
24569,L162650,u775,m49,TRIP,What?
24570,L162649,u768,m49,LEX,"Trip, you fuckin' asshole."
24571,L162646,u775,m49,TRIP,"Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day."
24572,L162645,u768,m49,LEX,"Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD."

24574,L162643,u768,m49,LEX,"Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell."
24575,L162623,u768,m49,LEX,"I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it."
24576,L162622,u775,m49,TRIP,Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
24577,L163153,u775,m49,TRIP,"Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks."
24578,L163152,u769,m49,LITTLE KID,"You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life."
24579,L163151,u775,m49,TRIP,Two hundred bucks?
24580,L163116,u769,m49,LITTLE KID,"Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending."
24581,L163115,u775,m49,TRIP,"Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!"
24582,L163109,u769,m49,LITTLE KID,"It's not nearly enough, punk."
24583,L163108,u775,m49,TRIP,"Look, you can have my wallet..."
24584,L163107,u769,m49,LITTLE KID,A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
24585,L163106,u775,m49,TRIP,What do you want?
24586,L163105,u769,m49,LITTLE KID,"Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event."
24587,L163104,u775,m49,TRIP,"Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba..."
24588,L163102,u769,m49,LITTLE KID,"No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you."
24589,L163101,u775,m49,TRIP,"A likely story. Hand it over, kid."
24590,L163100,u769,m49,LITTLE KID,"Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me."
24591,L163278,u775,m49,TRIP,Neither do I!
24592,L163277,u770,m49,MAN WITH COAT,I don't even think you have a gun!
24593,L163276,u775,m49,TRIP,Not if I shoot first!
24594,L163275,u770,m49,MAN WITH COAT,"Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!"

24599,L162986,u774,m49,SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE,"Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not ""Taxi Driver."" Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and..."

24601,L162984,u774,m49,SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE,"Yeah, you did!"
24602,L162983,u776,m49,TRIP'S VOICE,I did?
24603,L162982,u774,m49,SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE,Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
24604,L162981,u776,m49,TRIP'S VOICE,Yeah.
24605,L162980,u774,m49,SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE,Is that your final answer?
24606,L162979,u776,m49,TRIP'S VOICE,"Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!"
24607,L162978,u774,m49,SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE,"I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?"
24608,L162977,u776,m49,TRIP'S VOICE,Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
24609,L162976,u774,m49,SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE,"Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller."
24610,L169012,u786,m50,JIM CUNNINGHAM,"Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour."
24611,L169011,u777,m50,AUDIENCE,GOOD MORNING!
24612,L169010,u786,m50,JIM CUNNINGHAM,Are you AFRAID?
24613,L169009,u777,m50,AUDIENCE,GOOD MORNING!
24614,L169008,u786,m50,JIM CUNNINGHAM,Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
24615,L169007,u777,m50,AUDIENCE,Good MORNING!
24616,L169006,u786,m50,JIM CUNNINGHAM,"That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, ""Good morning!"""
24617,L169005,u777,m50,AUDIENCE,Good morning...
24618,L169004,u786,m50,JIM CUNNINGHAM,"Good morning, mongrels!"
24619,L169319,u778,m50,DAVID,Did you know him?
24620,L169318,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Yeah.
24621,L169317,u778,m50,DAVID,I feel bad for his family.
24622,L169316,u778,m50,DAVID,Donnie. Donnie Darko.
24623,L169315,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,What was his name?
24624,L169314,u778,m50,DAVID,He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
24625,L169313,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,What happened?
24626,L169312,u778,m50,DAVID,Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
24627,L169311,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Hi... what's going on here?
24628,L169122,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,"Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job."
24629,L169121,u779,m50,DONNIE,Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
24630,L169120,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,"You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end."
24631,L169119,u779,m50,DONNIE,"If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?"
24632,L169118,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,I'm not following you.
24633,L169117,u779,m50,DONNIE,If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
24634,L169116,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
24635,L169115,u779,m50,DONNIE,Could these wormholes appear in nature?
24636,L169114,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,"Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered."
24637,L169113,u779,m50,DONNIE,Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
24638,L169112,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,Beg pardon?
24639,L169111,u779,m50,DONNIE,Like a spear.
24640,L169110,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
24641,L169070,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
24642,L169069,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life."
24643,L169068,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
24644,L168915,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,A metal craft of any kind.
24645,L168914,u779,m50,DONNIE,Like a DeLorean.
24646,L168913,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
24647,L168912,u779,m50,DONNIE,So... that's it?
24648,L168911,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,"A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man."
24649,L168910,u779,m50,DONNIE,-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
24650,L168909,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,Theoretically.
24651,L168908,u779,m50,DONNIE,"So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --"
24652,L168907,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
24653,L168906,u779,m50,DONNIE,I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
24654,L168905,u780,m50,DR. MONNITOFF,Donnie.
24655,L168904,u779,m50,DONNIE,Dr. Monnitoff?
24656,L168711,u793,m50,SAMANTHA,Donnie! Give it back!
24657,L168710,u779,m50,DONNIE,"""The Last Unicorn!"" By Samantha Darko."
24658,L168655,u793,m50,SAMANTHA,You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
24659,L168654,u779,m50,DONNIE,"What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?"
24660,L168636,u793,m50,SAMANTHA,I'm telling Mom.
24661,L168635,u779,m50,DONNIE,"When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face."
24662,L168634,u793,m50,SAMANTHA,Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
24663,L168575,u779,m50,DONNIE,Not until like... eighth grade.
24664,L168574,u793,m50,SAMANTHA,When can I squeeze one out?
24665,L169288,u779,m50,DONNIE,Our saviour...
24666,L169287,u795,m50,SETH,What did you say?
24667,L169286,u779,m50,DONNIE,Dea ex machina...
24668,L168955,u795,m50,SETH,You know what? I think that you did it.
24669,L168954,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about."
24670,L168953,u795,m50,SETH,That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
24671,L168952,u779,m50,DONNIE,I didn't say shit.
24672,L168951,u795,m50,SETH,Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
24673,L169091,u784,m50,FRANK,"You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you."
24674,L169090,u779,m50,DONNIE,How much longer is this gonna last?
24675,L169089,u784,m50,FRANK,It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
24676,L169088,u779,m50,DONNIE,Why do they call you Frank?
24677,L169087,u784,m50,FRANK,I am so sorry.
24678,L169086,u779,m50,DONNIE,What happened to your eye?
24679,L169084,u779,m50,DONNIE,Take it off. I want to see you.
24680,L169083,u784,m50,FRANK,Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
24681,L169082,u779,m50,DONNIE,Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
24682,L169081,u784,m50,FRANK,You have a request?
24683,L169080,u779,m50,DONNIE,You have to do something for me first.
24684,L169079,u784,m50,FRANK,I want to show you something.
24685,L168855,u784,m50,FRANK,"Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?"
24686,L168854,u779,m50,DONNIE,Where did you come from?
24687,L168853,u784,m50,FRANK,You'll know soon enough.
24688,L168852,u779,m50,DONNIE,Who is... we?
24689,L168851,u784,m50,FRANK,We just want to guide you in the right direction.
24690,L168850,u779,m50,DONNIE,Why did you make me flood the school?
24691,L168836,u784,m50,FRANK,I can do anything I want... and so can you...
24692,L168835,u779,m50,DONNIE,How can you do that?
24693,L169307,u779,m50,DONNIE,Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
24694,L169306,u791,m50,RONALD,"What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!"
24695,L168829,u779,m50,DONNIE,"A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail."
24696,L168828,u791,m50,RONALD,How old is Grandma Death?
24697,L168652,u779,m50,DONNIE,I don't wanna talk about it.
24698,L168651,u791,m50,RONALD,My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
24699,L168650,u779,m50,DONNIE,We went to a hotel.
24700,L168649,u791,m50,RONALD,"DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!"
24701,L169280,u779,m50,DONNIE,Yeah...
24702,L169279,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Is that a cellar door?
24703,L169275,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Who's Frank?
24704,L169274,u779,m50,DONNIE,No. Frank.
24705,L169273,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Why? Is this about the book?
24706,L169272,u779,m50,DONNIE,Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
24707,L169270,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Where are we going?
24708,L169269,u779,m50,DONNIE,Come with me.
24709,L169265,u779,m50,DONNIE,"There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine."
24710,L169264,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,What?
24711,L169260,u779,m50,DONNIE,It's safe here.
24712,L169259,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
24713,L169258,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,"Yeah, they told me to get out of the house."
24714,L169257,u779,m50,DONNIE,Did you call the cops?
24715,L169256,u779,m50,DONNIE,But you're OK?
24716,L169255,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
24717,L169254,u779,m50,DONNIE,Where is she?
24718,L169253,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,My mom is gone.
24719,L169252,u779,m50,DONNIE,Hey. You OK?
24720,L169251,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Hey.
24721,L169170,u779,m50,DONNIE,Then when? I have to talk to you.
24722,L169169,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,"Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time."
24723,L169168,u779,m50,DONNIE,Will you please talk to me?
24724,L169142,u779,m50,DONNIE,What do you mean?
24725,L169141,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,What's wrong with you?
24726,L169140,u779,m50,DONNIE,You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
24727,L169099,u779,m50,DONNIE,The whole movie. Let's go.
24728,L169098,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,What? How long was I asleep?
24729,L169067,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
24730,L169066,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep."
24731,L169065,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Infant Memory Generators.
24732,L169064,u779,m50,DONNIE,"So, we call them... IMGs."
24733,L169044,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Maybe she's asleep.
24734,L169043,u779,m50,DONNIE,I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
24735,L169042,u779,m50,DONNIE,She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
24736,L169041,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,"Oh, yeah.  ""The Philosophy of Time Travel"". What is this?"
24737,L169040,u779,m50,DONNIE,The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
24738,L169039,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Who?
24739,L169038,u779,m50,DONNIE,I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
24740,L169037,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Are you okay?
24741,L169036,u779,m50,DONNIE,They suspended me for two days.
24742,L169016,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,What?
24743,L169015,u779,m50,DONNIE,We're moving through time.
24744,L168973,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
24745,L168972,u779,m50,DONNIE,I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
24746,L168971,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,"No... Donnie, wait. I've never..."
24747,L168970,u779,m50,DONNIE,That's alright... I understand.
24748,L168969,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,You want to kiss me...
24749,L168968,u779,m50,DONNIE,Well...
24750,L168967,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,And what?
24751,L168966,u779,m50,DONNIE,You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
24752,L168965,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
24753,L168964,u779,m50,DONNIE,"With, like, images?"
24754,L168963,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
24755,L168962,u779,m50,DONNIE,Why not just buy your baby a night light?
24756,L168961,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,"Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness."
24757,L168958,u779,m50,DONNIE,I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
24758,L168957,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,What happened to your neck?
24759,L168874,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,"Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way."
24760,L168873,u779,m50,DONNIE,Why?
24761,L168872,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
24762,L168871,u779,m50,DONNIE,Yeah?
24763,L168870,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Donnie?
24764,L168869,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,And you'd never been there before?
24765,L168868,u779,m50,DONNIE,No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
24766,L168867,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,"So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?"
24767,L168866,u779,m50,DONNIE,It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
24768,L168865,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
24769,L168864,u779,m50,DONNIE,"No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there."
24770,L168863,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,"So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?"
24771,L168783,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,I'm going home.
24772,L168782,u779,m50,DONNIE,Where are you going?
24773,L168781,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Sure.
24774,L168780,u779,m50,DONNIE,"No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together."
24775,L168779,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Where are we going?
24776,L168778,u779,m50,DONNIE,Will you go with me?
24777,L168777,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,That was a compliment.
24778,L168776,u779,m50,DONNIE,I'm sorry.
24779,L168775,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,You're weird.
24780,L168774,u779,m50,DONNIE,We never would have had this conversation.
24781,L168773,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Why is that?
24782,L168772,u779,m50,DONNIE,It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
24783,L168771,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Until it withers away.
24784,L168770,u779,m50,DONNIE,The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
24785,L168769,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Wonder where we'll be then.
24786,L168768,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000."
24787,L168767,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,You mean soap?
24788,L168766,u779,m50,DONNIE,"I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine."
24789,L168765,u779,m50,DONNIE,That's easy. Antiseptics.
24790,L168764,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
24791,L168763,u779,m50,DONNIE,What makes you think I'm not?
24792,L168762,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
24793,L168761,u779,m50,DONNIE,"I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things."
24794,L168760,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
24795,L168759,u779,m50,DONNIE,Wow. Did he go to jail?
24796,L168758,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
24797,L168757,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?"
24798,L168756,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
24799,L168755,u779,m50,DONNIE,So... you just moved here?
24800,L168754,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Fuck them.
24801,L168753,u779,m50,DONNIE,I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
24802,L168752,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Don't look so freaked.
24803,L168751,u779,m50,DONNIE,Sure.
24804,L168750,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Wanna walk me home?
24805,L168749,u779,m50,DONNIE,School's cancelled.
24806,L168748,u785,m50,GRETCHEN,Hey...
24807,L168747,u779,m50,DONNIE,Hey...
24808,L168895,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,"If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day."
24809,L168894,u779,m50,DONNIE,People aren't that simple.
24810,L168893,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else."
24811,L168892,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
24812,L168891,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love."
24813,L168890,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,The Lifeline is divided that way.
24814,L168889,u779,m50,DONNIE,I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
24815,L168888,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
24816,L168887,u779,m50,DONNIE,"I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this."
24817,L169159,u792,m50,ROSE,It feels wonderful.
24818,L169158,u779,m50,DONNIE,How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
24819,L169157,u792,m50,ROSE,"If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow."
24820,L169156,u779,m50,DONNIE,Do you get to meet Ed?
24821,L169155,u792,m50,ROSE,I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
24822,L169063,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything."
24823,L169062,u792,m50,ROSE,"He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?"
24824,L168922,u792,m50,ROSE,That is a terrible nickname.
24825,L168921,u779,m50,DONNIE,Grandma Death.
24826,L168599,u779,m50,DONNIE,Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
24827,L168598,u792,m50,ROSE,You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
24828,L168597,u779,m50,DONNIE,"I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room."
24829,L168596,u792,m50,ROSE,I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
24830,L168588,u792,m50,ROSE,We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
24831,L168587,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?"
24832,L168583,u792,m50,ROSE,When did you stop taking your medication?
24833,L168582,u779,m50,DONNIE,You're such a fuck-ass.
24834,L168571,u792,m50,ROSE,"No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall."
24835,L168570,u779,m50,DONNIE,Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
24836,L169105,u782,m50,EDDIE,"I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them."
24837,L169104,u779,m50,DONNIE,"I know, Dad."
24838,L169103,u782,m50,EDDIE,You're my only son...
24839,L169102,u779,m50,DONNIE,A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
24840,L169101,u782,m50,EDDIE,Who's been giving you weird looks?
24841,L168927,u779,m50,DONNIE,I guess she just lost faith in the world.
24842,L168926,u782,m50,EDDIE,"You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself."
24843,L168924,u779,m50,DONNIE,"You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day."
24844,L168923,u782,m50,EDDIE,Grandma Death.
24845,L168685,u779,m50,DONNIE,Grandma Death.
24846,L168684,u782,m50,EDDIE,"Oh, shit!"
24847,L168683,u782,m50,EDDIE,You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
24848,L168682,u779,m50,DONNIE,So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
24849,L168681,u782,m50,EDDIE,No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
24850,L168680,u779,m50,DONNIE,Where it came from?
24851,L168679,u782,m50,EDDIE,Know what?
24852,L168678,u779,m50,DONNIE,Do they know yet?
24853,L168677,u782,m50,EDDIE,Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
24854,L168676,u779,m50,DONNIE,"It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit."
24855,L168675,u782,m50,EDDIE,So how was school today?
24856,L169185,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,"Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go."
24857,L169184,u779,m50,DONNIE,I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
24858,L169183,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
24859,L169182,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
24860,L169181,u779,m50,DONNIE,Cellar door.
24861,L169180,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,"A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that ""Cellar Door"" is the most beautiful."
24862,L169179,u779,m50,DONNIE,"What's ""Cellar Door""?"
24863,L169178,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
24864,L169177,u779,m50,DONNIE,What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
24865,L169176,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,"Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules."
24866,L169175,u779,m50,DONNIE,That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
24867,L169174,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
24868,L169173,u779,m50,DONNIE,Where are you going?
24869,L169172,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,"Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?"
24870,L169171,u779,m50,DONNIE,Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
24871,L169136,u779,m50,DONNIE,Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
24872,L169135,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
24873,L169134,u779,m50,DONNIE,Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
24874,L169133,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,"Because the rabbits are us, Donnie."
24875,L169132,u779,m50,DONNIE,Why should we care?
24876,L169131,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,"And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era."
24877,L168877,u779,m50,DONNIE,A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
24878,L168876,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,Who is Frank?
24879,L168668,u779,m50,DONNIE,Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
24880,L168667,u789,m50,MS. POMEROY,"Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?"
24881,L169241,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"Goodbye, Donald."
24882,L169240,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Goodbye, Dr. Thurman."
24883,L169239,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists."
24884,L169238,u779,m50,DONNIE,Thank you.
24885,L169237,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
24886,L169235,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up."
24887,L169234,u779,m50,DONNIE,It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
24888,L169233,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else."
24889,L169232,u779,m50,DONNIE,He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
24890,L169231,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"Where is he, Donald?"
24891,L169230,u779,m50,DONNIE,I can see him right now!
24892,L169228,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Who is he going to kill?
24893,L169227,u779,m50,DONNIE,Frank is going to kill.
24894,L169226,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,What is going to happen?
24895,L169224,u779,m50,DONNIE,Soon. Time is almost up.
24896,L169223,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,When will this happen?
24897,L169222,u779,m50,DONNIE,It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
24898,L169221,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Then how is time travel possible?
24899,L169220,u779,m50,DONNIE,Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
24900,L169219,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,How is that possible?
24901,L169218,u779,m50,DONNIE,I have the power to build a time machine.
24902,L169217,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"Where are we going, Donald?"
24903,L169216,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Where are we going?
24904,L169215,u779,m50,DONNIE,I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
24905,L169214,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,God exists because you're horny.
24906,L169213,u779,m50,DONNIE,Because I'm so horny.
24907,L169212,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Why?
24908,L169211,u779,m50,DONNIE,I think now that he might...
24909,L169210,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,If God exists?
24910,L169209,u779,m50,DONNIE,I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
24911,L169208,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?"
24912,L169207,u779,m50,DONNIE,Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
24913,L169206,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,You've done it again?
24914,L169205,u779,m50,DONNIE,That I did it again.
24915,L169204,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,What else makes you feel regret?
24916,L169203,u779,m50,DONNIE,Regret.
24917,L169202,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
24918,L169201,u779,m50,DONNIE,Hungry Hungry Hippos.
24919,L169200,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,What did you want for Christmas that year?
24920,L169199,u779,m50,DONNIE,They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
24921,L169198,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
24922,L169197,u779,m50,DONNIE,Yes. I went to jail.
24923,L169196,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,But you were punished.
24924,L169195,u779,m50,DONNIE,People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
24925,L169194,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
24926,L169193,u779,m50,DONNIE,People get hurt.
24927,L169192,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?"
24928,L169191,u779,m50,DONNIE,I... I was playing with fire.
24929,L169190,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?"
24930,L169189,u779,m50,DONNIE,Yes.
24931,L169188,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?"
24932,L169060,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"Have you ever made love, Donald?"
24933,L169059,u779,m50,DONNIE,Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
24934,L169058,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,The good stuff.
24935,L169057,u779,m50,DONNIE,"I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff."
24936,L169056,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,I know.
24937,L169055,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too."
24938,L169053,u779,m50,DONNIE,"You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself."
24939,L169052,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
24940,L169051,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank..."
24941,L169050,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
24942,L169049,u779,m50,DONNIE,Nothing.
24943,L169048,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,What did you find?
24944,L169047,u779,m50,DONNIE,It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
24945,L169046,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,And they grow out of our stomachs?
24946,L168942,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,No. That makes you keep searching.
24947,L168941,u779,m50,DONNIE,"I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?"
24948,L168940,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Do you feel alone right now?
24949,L168939,u779,m50,DONNIE,No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
24950,L168938,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Is Callie still around?
24951,L168937,u779,m50,DONNIE,It reminded me of my dog Callie.
24952,L168936,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,How does that make you feel?
24953,L168935,u779,m50,DONNIE,"I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone."
24954,L168934,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,A sign from whom?
24955,L168933,u779,m50,DONNIE,I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
24956,L168932,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
24957,L168931,u779,m50,DONNIE,I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
24958,L168930,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Can anyone else see him?
24959,L168929,u779,m50,DONNIE,Four times... so far.
24960,L168928,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,How many times have you seen Frank?
24961,L168802,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
24962,L168801,u779,m50,DONNIE,"No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!"
24963,L168800,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"What about your family, Donnie?"
24964,L168799,u779,m50,DONNIE,I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
24965,L168798,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Who is the boss?
24966,L168797,u779,m50,DONNIE,"I think... about... ""Who's the Boss?"""
24967,L168796,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,What else do you think about during school?
24968,L168795,u779,m50,DONNIE,I think about... fucking a lot during school.
24969,L168794,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,I asked you about school.
24970,L168793,u779,m50,DONNIE,I think about girls a lot.
24971,L168792,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,How are things going at school?
24972,L168791,u779,m50,DONNIE,Yes.
24973,L168790,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Do you think a lot about girls?
24974,L168789,u779,m50,DONNIE,Gretchen. We're going together now.
24975,L168788,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,What is her name?
24976,L168787,u779,m50,DONNIE,I met a girl.
24977,L168786,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"So, tell me about your day, Donald."
24978,L168785,u779,m50,DONNIE,Yes.
24979,L168784,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?"
24980,L168706,u779,m50,DONNIE,No.  That's stupid.
24981,L168705,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
24982,L168704,u779,m50,DONNIE,Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
24983,L168703,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Follow him where?
24984,L168702,u779,m50,DONNIE,He said to follow him.
24985,L168701,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
24986,L168699,u779,m50,DONNIE,A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
24987,L168698,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,I don't own a television.
24988,L168697,u779,m50,DONNIE,Don't you watch the news?
24989,L168696,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,How so?
24990,L168695,u779,m50,DONNIE,I think he saved my life.
24991,L168694,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Frank.
24992,L168693,u779,m50,DONNIE,His name is Frank.
24993,L168692,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Would you like to talk about this friend?
24994,L168691,u779,m50,DONNIE,"So, I met a new friend."
24995,L168690,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,"All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald."
24996,L168689,u779,m50,DONNIE,"I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically."
24997,L168688,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
24998,L169246,u779,m50,DONNIE,Everything is going to be just fine.
24999,L169245,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,"Okay, but it has to be a small one."
25000,L169244,u779,m50,DONNIE,Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
25001,L169243,u779,m50,DONNIE,Congratulations.
25002,L169242,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
25003,L168987,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,"That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it."
25004,L168986,u779,m50,DONNIE,Her name is Gretchen.
25005,L168985,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,"Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you."
25006,L168984,u779,m50,DONNIE,I was just being honest.
25007,L168983,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,"It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off."
25008,L168982,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication."
25009,L168981,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,No I don't.  She worries about you.
25010,L168980,u779,m50,DONNIE,Because you tell Mom everything.
25011,L168979,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,Why would I tell Mom?
25012,L168978,u779,m50,DONNIE,"You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?"
25013,L168977,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,What's her name?
25014,L168976,u779,m50,DONNIE,Yeah.
25015,L168975,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,So I hear you have a girlfriend.
25016,L168920,u779,m50,DONNIE,Guess who wrote it?
25017,L168919,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
25018,L168918,u779,m50,DONNIE,"It's called ""The Philosophy of Time Travel""."
25019,L168579,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
25020,L168578,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to."
25021,L169035,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ."
25022,L169034,u786,m50,JIM CUNNINGHAM,I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
25023,L169032,u779,m50,DONNIE,"Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!"
25024,L169031,u786,m50,JIM CUNNINGHAM,"Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid."
25025,L169030,u779,m50,DONNIE,Gerald.
25026,L169029,u786,m50,JIM CUNNINGHAM,"Excuse me? What's your name, son?"
25027,L169028,u779,m50,DONNIE,How much are they paying you to be here?
25028,L169003,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
25029,L169002,u792,m50,ROSE,If that's what you think is necessary.
25030,L169001,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
25031,L169000,u792,m50,ROSE,I... What can we do?
25032,L168999,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
25033,L168998,u792,m50,ROSE,You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
25034,L168997,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
25035,L168996,u792,m50,ROSE,Frank?
25036,L168995,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
25037,L168994,u792,m50,ROSE,Come again?
25038,L168993,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,Has your son ever told you about Frank?
25039,L168990,u792,m50,ROSE,"Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher."
25040,L168989,u781,m50,DR. THURMAN,What I think is going on with your son.
25041,L168988,u792,m50,ROSE,Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
25042,L168642,u782,m50,EDDIE,"He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed."
25043,L168641,u792,m50,ROSE,He was a year ahead of us?
25044,L168640,u782,m50,EDDIE,Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
25045,L168639,u792,m50,ROSE,What?
25046,L168633,u782,m50,EDDIE,You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
25047,L168632,u792,m50,ROSE,So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
25048,L168602,u782,m50,EDDIE,You're not a bitch.
25049,L168601,u792,m50,ROSE,Our son just called me a bitch.
25050,L169163,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,"Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight."
25051,L169162,u792,m50,ROSE,Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
25052,L168594,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
25053,L168593,u792,m50,ROSE,It is a big deal.
25054,L168592,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
25055,L168591,u792,m50,ROSE,How did you know --
25056,L168590,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
25057,L168586,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,You can suck a fuck.
25058,L168585,u792,m50,ROSE,That's enough.
25059,L168584,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
25060,L168577,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,Donnie? You're a dick.
25061,L168576,u792,m50,ROSE,Excuse me?
25062,L168573,u792,m50,ROSE,"If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed."
25063,L168572,u783,m50,ELIZABETH,"I haven't been accepted yet, mother."
25064,L168734,u787,m50,LEROY,I guess they made him do it.
25065,L168733,u790,m50,PRINCIPAL COLE,How did this happen?
25066,L168732,u787,m50,LEROY,Yep.
25067,L168731,u790,m50,PRINCIPAL COLE,Christ. Is that an axe?
25068,L168730,u787,m50,LEROY,"What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else."
25069,L168729,u790,m50,PRINCIPAL COLE,What else?
25070,L168728,u787,m50,LEROY,I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
25071,L169153,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
25072,L169152,u792,m50,ROSE,"Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York..."
25073,L169151,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,"Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go."
25074,L169150,u792,m50,ROSE,But now you can't go.
25075,L169149,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,"Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip."
25076,L169148,u792,m50,ROSE,Beg pardon?
25077,L169147,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
25078,L169146,u792,m50,ROSE,"Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon."
25079,L169145,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,"Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham."
25080,L169144,u792,m50,ROSE,Kitty...
25081,L169143,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,Rose.
25082,L168899,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,"Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear."
25083,L168898,u792,m50,ROSE,"Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him."
25084,L168862,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,"I think we've all seen ""Bonanza""."
25085,L168861,u792,m50,ROSE,Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
25086,L168858,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
25087,L168857,u792,m50,ROSE,Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
25088,L168848,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
25089,L168847,u790,m50,PRINCIPAL COLE,This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
25090,L168846,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
25091,L168844,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
25092,L168843,u790,m50,PRINCIPAL COLE,Kitty...
25093,L168842,u788,m50,MS. FARMER,"Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge."
25094,L168841,u790,m50,PRINCIPAL COLE,"Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait..."
25095,L169248,u791,m50,RONALD,I stole four beers from my dad.
25096,L169247,u794,m50,SEAN,"We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper."
25097,L168821,u791,m50,RONALD,Not Vanity. He's a homo.
25098,L168820,u794,m50,SEAN,"Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny."
25099,L168819,u791,m50,RONALD,Smurfette doesn't fuck.
25100,L168818,u794,m50,SEAN,No more fuckin' for her.
25101,L168817,u791,m50,RONALD,Wicked.
25102,L168815,u794,m50,SEAN,Raspberry.
25103,L168814,u791,m50,RONALD,What is this shit?
25104,L168720,u791,m50,RONALD,Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
25105,L168719,u794,m50,SEAN,All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
25106,L168717,u794,m50,SEAN,"Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home."
25107,L168716,u791,m50,RONALD,There's no rule!
25108,L168715,u794,m50,SEAN,"You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55."
25109,L168714,u791,m50,RONALD,Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
25110,L168660,u794,m50,SEAN,"Go back to China, bitch!"
25111,L168659,u791,m50,RONALD,Chut up!
25112,L171359,u796,m51,AMBER,I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
25113,L171358,u810,m51,LORETTA,"Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!"
25114,L171357,u796,m51,AMBER,"I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!"
25115,L171306,u810,m51,LORETTA,"Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go."
25116,L171305,u796,m51,AMBER,I gotta work with these women.
25117,L171304,u810,m51,LORETTA,I'm sorry. They're just starin'.

25135,L171285,u796,m51,AMBER,I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
25136,L171284,u810,m51,LORETTA,What is wrong with you?
25137,L171217,u796,m51,AMBER,"...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer..."
25138,L171216,u810,m51,LORETTA,Thank God for bunge cords.
25139,L171215,u796,m51,AMBER,"Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over."

25141,L171065,u796,m51,AMBER,"Loretta, never have kids."

25153,L170982,u810,m51,LORETTA,"Simple. Just say, ""Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'."" There. Easy as pie."

25155,L170978,u796,m51,AMBER,"Oh God, I'm dead..."
25156,L170977,u810,m51,LORETTA,"I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!"
25157,L170976,u796,m51,AMBER,I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
25158,L170975,u810,m51,LORETTA,You're what?!
25159,L170961,u810,m51,LORETTA,"Don't let that worry you, Annette!"
25160,L170960,u796,m51,AMBER,Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!

25166,L171168,u796,m51,AMBER,Yah?
25167,L171167,u809,m51,LISA,"Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a ""skinny little fag"" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back."
25168,L171166,u796,m51,AMBER,"Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't."
25169,L171165,u809,m51,LISA,"Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney."
25170,L171164,u796,m51,AMBER,Your parents'd kill you.
25171,L171163,u809,m51,LISA,"Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one ""Liza"" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me."
25172,L171160,u809,m51,LISA,"My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it."
25173,L171159,u796,m51,AMBER,"""Here,"" wh-wh-what?"
25174,L171158,u809,m51,LISA,Amber? Here.

25177,L171155,u809,m51,LISA,"Oh, Amber..."
25178,L171149,u796,m51,AMBER,"But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong..."
25179,L171148,u803,m51,GLADYS,"Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience."
25180,L171147,u796,m51,AMBER,"I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight."
25181,L171146,u803,m51,GLADYS,Huh?
25182,L171145,u796,m51,AMBER,Mrs. Leeman?
25183,L170727,u803,m51,GLADYS,"Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'."
25184,L170726,u796,m51,AMBER,I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
25185,L170951,u812,m51,MR. LARSON,No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
25186,L170950,u796,m51,AMBER,"Relax, that's my ma's code for, ""Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."""
25187,L170949,u812,m51,MR. LARSON,You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
25188,L170948,u796,m51,AMBER,I'm gonna need more caps.
25189,L170947,u796,m51,AMBER,"No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head."
25190,L170946,u812,m51,MR. LARSON,Amber...
25191,L170939,u796,m51,AMBER,"-- red nose and ears. I know, I know."
25192,L170938,u812,m51,MR. LARSON,"Well, your ""cheap whore"" is this family's ""lovin' mother.""  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and..."
25193,L170937,u796,m51,AMBER,Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
25194,L171214,u796,m51,AMBER,It's okay.

25199,L171000,u797,m51,ANNETTE,"It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber."
25200,L170999,u796,m51,AMBER,God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
25201,L170998,u797,m51,ANNETTE,"Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you..."
25202,L170997,u796,m51,AMBER,"That's it, I'm goin'..."
25203,L170996,u797,m51,ANNETTE,"Let me tell you ""scary,"" Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a ""lifer"" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent ""raisin ranch"" where they'll change me twice a day."
25204,L170995,u796,m51,AMBER,"Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary."
25205,L170994,u797,m51,ANNETTE,You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
25206,L170993,u796,m51,AMBER,"Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again."
25207,L170992,u797,m51,ANNETTE,"Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too."
25208,L170991,u796,m51,AMBER,Ow!

25211,L170988,u797,m51,ANNETTE,I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
25212,L170987,u796,m51,AMBER,Mom!
25213,L170986,u796,m51,AMBER,"Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant."

25217,L170821,u797,m51,ANNETTE,"Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first."
25218,L170820,u796,m51,AMBER,They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
25219,L170819,u797,m51,ANNETTE,Oh shit!
25220,L170818,u796,m51,AMBER,That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.

25223,L171143,u796,m51,AMBER,"Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!"
25224,L171142,u806,m51,IRIS,Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!

25228,L171138,u806,m51,IRIS,"Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant."
25229,L171137,u796,m51,AMBER,"Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?"
25230,L171102,u806,m51,IRIS,We all do. Now let's go.

25233,L171083,u806,m51,IRIS,"Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your ""Physical Fitness"" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies."
25234,L171082,u796,m51,AMBER,Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.

25478,L172366,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,Yes -- why?
25479,L172365,u818,m52,CHICO,Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
25480,L172364,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
25481,L172472,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door."
25482,L172471,u818,m52,CHICO,Sure.
25483,L172470,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"So! -- He's on your side, too."
25484,L172469,u818,m52,CHICO,Fine.  We gotta him.
25485,L172468,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?"
25486,L172467,u818,m52,CHICO,"Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches."
25487,L172466,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Anything else?
25488,L172465,u818,m52,CHICO,That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
25489,L172464,u820,m52,GROUCHO,With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
25490,L172460,u818,m52,CHICO,"Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning."
25491,L172459,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers."
25492,L172458,u818,m52,CHICO,That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
25493,L172457,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men."
25494,L172456,u818,m52,CHICO,I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
25495,L172455,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?"
25496,L172454,u818,m52,CHICO,We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
25497,L172453,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?"
25498,L172452,u818,m52,CHICO,No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
25499,L172451,u820,m52,GROUCHO,That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
25500,L172450,u818,m52,CHICO,That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
25501,L172449,u820,m52,GROUCHO,That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
25502,L172448,u818,m52,CHICO,"Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men."
25503,L172447,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Now -- how many men you got in your army?
25504,L172446,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
25505,L172445,u818,m52,CHICO,"Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side."
25506,L172444,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?"
25507,L172443,u818,m52,CHICO,I can't do it...
25508,L172442,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight..."
25509,L172403,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --"
25510,L172402,u818,m52,CHICO,You no gotta no gun.
25511,L172295,u818,m52,CHICO,"I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something..."
25512,L172294,u820,m52,GROUCHO,You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
25513,L172292,u820,m52,GROUCHO,That's not bad for any day.
25514,L172291,u818,m52,CHICO,He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
25515,L172281,u818,m52,CHICO,We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
25516,L172280,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"I'm glad I didn't ask you for ""Washington Crossing the Delaware""."
25517,L172277,u818,m52,CHICO,"Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?"
25518,L172276,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"By the way, are you sure we need a spy?"
25519,L172275,u818,m52,CHICO,Send in the next girl.
25520,L172217,u818,m52,CHICO,"I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs."
25521,L172216,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
25522,L172215,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army."
25523,L172214,u818,m52,CHICO,You told it to me.
25524,L172213,u820,m52,GROUCHO,You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
25525,L172212,u820,m52,GROUCHO,What did you say to her?
25526,L172211,u818,m52,CHICO,She did.
25527,L172210,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Why didn't his niece slap your face?
25528,L172209,u818,m52,CHICO,"He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face."
25529,L172208,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?"
25530,L172207,u818,m52,CHICO,That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
25531,L172206,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Then I demand an apology!
25532,L172205,u818,m52,CHICO,"You was insulted, but you don't know it."
25533,L172204,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Why wasn't I insulted?
25534,L172203,u818,m52,CHICO,That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
25535,L172202,u820,m52,GROUCHO,My card.
25536,L172201,u818,m52,CHICO,"Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody."
25537,L172200,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
25538,L172199,u818,m52,CHICO,I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
25539,L172198,u820,m52,GROUCHO,You get half mine and I get half yours.
25540,L172197,u818,m52,CHICO,What do I get?
25541,L172196,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission."
25542,L172195,u818,m52,CHICO,'At's-a fine.
25543,L172194,u820,m52,GROUCHO,I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
25544,L172193,u818,m52,CHICO,"Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation."
25545,L172192,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue."
25546,L172191,u818,m52,CHICO,I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
25547,L172190,u820,m52,GROUCHO,In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
25548,L172189,u818,m52,CHICO,I don't wanna work at all.
25549,L172188,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Then you don't wanna work hard?
25550,L172187,u818,m52,CHICO,That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
25551,L172186,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
25552,L172185,u818,m52,CHICO,What other job you got?
25553,L172184,u820,m52,GROUCHO,I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
25554,L172183,u818,m52,CHICO,"Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back."
25555,L172182,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --"
25556,L172181,u818,m52,CHICO,"Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him."
25557,L172180,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country."
25558,L172179,u818,m52,CHICO,"No, but I shot some ducks."
25559,L172178,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Did you shoot the rapids?
25560,L172177,u818,m52,CHICO,'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
25561,L172176,u820,m52,GROUCHO,You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
25562,L172175,u818,m52,CHICO,"Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement."
25563,L172174,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?"
25564,L172173,u818,m52,CHICO,"Oh no, I can't do it."
25565,L172172,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling ""peanuts"" in front of the House of Representatives."
25566,L172171,u818,m52,CHICO,That was for you.
25567,L172166,u820,m52,GROUCHO,I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
25568,L172165,u818,m52,CHICO,He only weighs ten ounces --
25569,L172164,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?"
25570,L172163,u818,m52,CHICO,I don't want him.
25571,L172162,u820,m52,GROUCHO,I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
25572,L172161,u818,m52,CHICO,Yankee Poodle.
25573,L172160,u820,m52,GROUCHO,What do you whistle?
25574,L172159,u818,m52,CHICO,"I don't call him, I whistle."
25575,L172158,u820,m52,GROUCHO,I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
25576,L172157,u818,m52,CHICO,"Yeh, he's only got one eye."
25577,L172156,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Half watch dog?
25578,L172155,u818,m52,CHICO,He's half poodle and half watch dog -
25579,L172154,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Well - what is he now?
25580,L172153,u818,m52,CHICO,He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
25581,L172152,u820,m52,GROUCHO,What kind of a dog is he?
25582,L172151,u818,m52,CHICO,"No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --"
25583,L172150,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Have you got a license?
25584,L172149,u818,m52,CHICO,All right -
25585,L172148,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Hey you!!
25586,L172482,u818,m52,CHICO,I can't do it right away.
25587,L172481,u822,m52,TRENTINO,It must be done right away.
25588,L172480,u818,m52,CHICO,"That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale."
25589,L172479,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Firefly must be captured at any cost.
25590,L172478,u818,m52,CHICO,All right -- I'll go out and find one.
25591,L172477,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary."
25592,L172146,u818,m52,CHICO,He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S
25593,L172145,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
25594,L172144,u818,m52,CHICO,"How'm I doing, boss?"
25595,L172111,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel."
25596,L172110,u819,m52,ENSEMBLE,The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride.
25597,L172109,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!"
25598,L172108,u819,m52,ENSEMBLE,So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share.
25599,L172107,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!"
25600,L172103,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it."
25601,L172102,u819,m52,ENSEMBLE,"If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -"
25602,L172101,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden..."
25603,L172100,u819,m52,ENSEMBLE,"We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA"
25604,L172387,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
25605,L172386,u823,m52,VERA,Are you sure you're not tired?
25606,L172379,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
25607,L172378,u823,m52,VERA,Are you getting tired?
25608,L172377,u820,m52,GROUCHO,This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
25609,L172376,u823,m52,VERA,I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
25610,L172323,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone..."
25611,L172322,u823,m52,VERA,"Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?"
25612,L172253,u823,m52,VERA,Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
25613,L172252,u820,m52,GROUCHO,You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
25614,L172073,u820,m52,GROUCHO,You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary?
25615,L172072,u823,m52,VERA,"Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom."
25616,L172335,u820,m52,GROUCHO,I still like UPSTART the best.
25617,L172334,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
25618,L172333,u820,m52,GROUCHO,That's it...
25619,L172332,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
25620,L172331,u820,m52,GROUCHO,No... it was a seven letter word.
25621,L172330,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Was it -- swine?
25622,L172329,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"No, that wasn't it..."
25623,L172328,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Oh -- you mean... worm?
25624,L172327,u820,m52,GROUCHO,I don't remember.
25625,L172326,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?"
25626,L172321,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition..."
25627,L172320,u822,m52,TRENTINO,I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
25628,L172319,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets..."
25629,L172318,u822,m52,TRENTINO,I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
25630,L172259,u820,m52,GROUCHO,THEN IT'S WAR!
25631,L172258,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Bah!!
25632,L172257,u820,m52,GROUCHO,How're ya fixed for ammunition?
25633,L172256,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Yes.
25634,L172255,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Then it's war?
25635,L172245,u820,m52,GROUCHO,That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
25636,L172244,u822,m52,TRENTINO,You upstart!
25637,L172243,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Once more!
25638,L172242,u822,m52,TRENTINO,You worm!
25639,L172241,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Give me that again!
25640,L172240,u822,m52,TRENTINO,You swine!
25641,L172239,u820,m52,GROUCHO,That's what you think.
25642,L172236,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well, why not say the least and get it over with?"
25643,L172235,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least..."
25644,L172230,u820,m52,GROUCHO,What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
25645,L172229,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
25646,L172228,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --"
25647,L172071,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"And Vera niece, too."
25648,L172070,u822,m52,TRENTINO,You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
25649,L172069,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Go ahead.
25650,L172068,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"Excellency, may I present my niece."
25651,L172067,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder."
25652,L172066,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"Your Excellency, haven't we met before?"
25653,L172065,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose."
25654,L172064,u822,m52,TRENTINO,$50?
25655,L172063,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?"
25656,L172062,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
25657,L172061,u820,m52,GROUCHO,I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
25658,L172060,u822,m52,TRENTINO,I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
25659,L172059,u820,m52,GROUCHO,That's even a greater honor.
25660,L172521,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,The king can do no wrong!
25661,L172520,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong."
25662,L172399,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?"
25663,L172398,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,But -
25664,L172397,u820,m52,GROUCHO,THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
25665,L172396,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
25666,L172395,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
25667,L172394,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War."
25668,L172393,u820,m52,GROUCHO,WHAT  ?
25669,L172392,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
25670,L172391,u820,m52,GROUCHO,That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
25671,L172390,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened."
25672,L172389,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Take a seat -- you're next.
25673,L172388,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,I hope I'm not interrupting.
25674,L172347,u820,m52,GROUCHO,You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
25675,L172346,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,Why -- why -- of course.
25676,L172345,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
25677,L172343,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet."
25678,L172342,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness..."
25679,L172341,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,Now -- er --
25680,L172340,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you..."
25681,L172325,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me."
25682,L172324,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"Oh, won't you reconsider..."
25683,L172317,u820,m52,GROUCHO,Let him patch up his own breeches...
25684,L172316,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
25685,L172315,u820,m52,GROUCHO,So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
25686,L172234,u820,m52,GROUCHO,I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
25687,L172233,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say."
25688,L172232,u820,m52,GROUCHO,All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
25689,L172231,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"Oh, Rufus!"
25690,L172117,u820,m52,GROUCHO,He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
25691,L172116,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg..."
25692,L172115,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --"
25693,L172114,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?"
25694,L172113,u820,m52,GROUCHO,That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
25695,L172112,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
25696,L172099,u820,m52,GROUCHO,These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
25697,L172098,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
25698,L172097,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more."
25699,L172096,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us."
25700,L172056,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you."
25701,L172055,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,Your Excellency!
25702,L172054,u820,m52,GROUCHO,No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
25703,L172053,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
25704,L172052,u820,m52,GROUCHO,I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
25705,L172051,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
25706,L172050,u820,m52,GROUCHO,"Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- ""D"" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?"
25707,L172049,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for."
25708,L172046,u820,m52,GROUCHO,You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
25709,L172045,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,What'll I do with this card?
25710,L172307,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"For you, I would do anything..."
25711,L172306,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"Oh, would you...?"
25712,L172305,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency."
25713,L172248,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,This is terrible!
25714,L172247,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war."
25715,L172238,u822,m52,TRENTINO,I didn't come here to be insulted.
25716,L172237,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
25717,L172227,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
25718,L172226,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,Well no -- not exactly -- but --
25719,L172225,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
25720,L172224,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,"Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --"
25721,L172223,u822,m52,TRENTINO,...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
25722,L172022,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land."
25723,L172021,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
25724,L172020,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything."
25725,L172019,u821,m52,MRS. TEASDALE,Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
25726,L172309,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Perhaps he will listen to you...
25727,L172308,u823,m52,VERA,If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
25728,L172299,u823,m52,VERA,Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
25729,L172298,u822,m52,TRENTINO,Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
25730,L172297,u823,m52,VERA,I thought everything was working out fine.
25731,L172296,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool..."
25732,L172251,u823,m52,VERA,It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
25733,L172250,u822,m52,TRENTINO,My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
25734,L172249,u823,m52,VERA,"Uncle, you can't do this!"
25735,L172029,u822,m52,TRENTINO,"That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece."
25736,L172028,u823,m52,VERA,"Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly."
25737,L172027,u822,m52,TRENTINO,With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
25738,L172026,u823,m52,VERA,So that's the one you want to marry.
25739,L180382,u832,m53,MERRICK,"If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good."
25740,L180381,u824,m53,ANNE,"Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment."
25741,L180380,u832,m53,MERRICK,"She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her."
25742,L180379,u824,m53,ANNE,Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
25743,L180375,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Oh, yes."
25744,L180374,u824,m53,ANNE,I've always thought that myself.
25745,L180373,u832,m53,MERRICK,They have noble faces.
25746,L180370,u832,m53,MERRICK,How lovely.
25747,L180369,u824,m53,ANNE,And here is one of Frederick's mother.
25748,L180352,u824,m53,ANNE,Oh?
25749,L180351,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room."
25750,L180348,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Two, please."
25751,L180347,u824,m53,ANNE,One or two?
25752,L180346,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Yes please, two."
25753,L180345,u824,m53,ANNE,"Mr. Merrick, sugar?"
25754,L180508,u824,m53,ANNE,Oh Frederick.
25755,L180507,u838,m53,TREVES,...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
25756,L180506,u824,m53,ANNE,"Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?"
25757,L180505,u838,m53,TREVES,But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
25758,L180504,u824,m53,ANNE,"Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you."
25759,L180503,u838,m53,TREVES,That I am very little different from him.
25760,L180502,u824,m53,ANNE,"Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?"
25761,L180501,u838,m53,TREVES,Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
25762,L180500,u824,m53,ANNE,...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
25763,L180499,u838,m53,TREVES,Hmmm?
25764,L180498,u824,m53,ANNE,More romances for John?
25765,L180497,u824,m53,ANNE,"Dinner will be served, shortly, dear."
25766,L180496,u838,m53,TREVES,You stay with me.
25767,L180372,u824,m53,ANNE,And here are my mother and father.
25768,L180371,u838,m53,TREVES,Yes.
25769,L180350,u824,m53,ANNE,Do you?
25770,L180349,u838,m53,TREVES,John loves the house.
25771,L180168,u838,m53,TREVES,"I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm..."
25772,L180167,u824,m53,ANNE,"Well, these things take time."
25773,L180166,u838,m53,TREVES,I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
25774,L180165,u824,m53,ANNE,"I'm sure I don't know, Freddie."
25775,L180164,u838,m53,TREVES,And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
25776,L180163,u824,m53,ANNE,"Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?"
25777,L180162,u838,m53,TREVES,"I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?"
25778,L180161,u824,m53,ANNE,"Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?"
25779,L180160,u838,m53,TREVES,"He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?"
25780,L180159,u824,m53,ANNE,But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
25781,L180158,u838,m53,TREVES,"Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me."
25782,L180157,u824,m53,ANNE,What do you mean?
25783,L180156,u838,m53,TREVES,"I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom."
25784,L180155,u824,m53,ANNE,"Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged."
25785,L179960,u838,m53,TREVES,"No, I think a whiskey."
25786,L179959,u824,m53,ANNE,"Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?"
25787,L179958,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?"
25788,L179957,u824,m53,ANNE,"Did it go well, darling?"
25789,L179847,u838,m53,TREVES,I'll join you shortly.
25790,L179846,u824,m53,ANNE,You won't be long?
25791,L179972,u838,m53,TREVES,I'll get my bag.
25792,L179971,u825,m53,BOY,Like this.
25793,L179970,u838,m53,TREVES,What is it?
25794,L179969,u825,m53,BOY,Our man is sick. Come right away.
25795,L179889,u838,m53,TREVES,Did you see it?
25796,L179888,u825,m53,BOY,I found it.
25797,L179887,u838,m53,TREVES,Yes?
25798,L179886,u825,m53,BOY,"Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir."
25799,L180635,u826,m53,BYTES,Shut up!
25800,L180634,u825,m53,BOY,Don't!
25801,L180633,u826,m53,BYTES,I'll show you! I'll show you!
25802,L180632,u825,m53,BOY,What are you going to do?
25803,L180631,u826,m53,BYTES,If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
25804,L180630,u825,m53,BOY,"He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die."
25805,L180629,u826,m53,BYTES,"He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!"
25806,L180628,u825,m53,BOY,"Aw, Bytes, he's sick."
25807,L180627,u826,m53,BYTES,"You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!"
25808,L180145,u826,m53,BYTES,Right... Right.
25809,L180144,u838,m53,TREVES,Now I think we really do understand one another.
25810,L180141,u826,m53,BYTES,"I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!"
25811,L180140,u838,m53,TREVES,So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
25812,L180139,u826,m53,BYTES,I want him back!
25813,L180138,u838,m53,TREVES,You don't own this man!
25814,L180137,u826,m53,BYTES,"You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back."
25815,L180136,u838,m53,TREVES,All you do is profit from another man's misery!
25816,L180135,u826,m53,BYTES,"He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!"
25817,L180134,u838,m53,TREVES,I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
25818,L180133,u826,m53,BYTES,"Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!"
25819,L180132,u838,m53,TREVES,"You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what..."
25820,L180131,u826,m53,BYTES,"DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!"
25821,L180130,u838,m53,TREVES,He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
25822,L180129,u826,m53,BYTES,"Never mind that, I want my man!"
25823,L180128,u838,m53,TREVES,"Just a moment, how did you get in here?"
25824,L180127,u826,m53,BYTES,I want my man back.
25825,L179988,u838,m53,TREVES,Everything will be seen to.
25826,L179987,u826,m53,BYTES,"I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?"
25827,L179985,u838,m53,TREVES,"You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his ""fall"". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab."
25828,L179984,u826,m53,BYTES,Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
25829,L179983,u838,m53,TREVES,This man belongs in hospital.
25830,L179982,u826,m53,BYTES,"That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy."
25831,L179981,u838,m53,TREVES,Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
25832,L179980,u826,m53,BYTES,He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
25833,L179979,u838,m53,TREVES,He must have taken quite a fall.
25834,L179978,u826,m53,BYTES,He fell.  He falls.
25835,L179977,u838,m53,TREVES,What happened?
25836,L179976,u838,m53,TREVES,I intend to.
25837,L179975,u826,m53,BYTES,"He was fine when he left here, and now look at him."
25838,L179974,u838,m53,TREVES,What do you mean?
25839,L179973,u826,m53,BYTES,What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
25840,L180516,u827,m53,CARR,"Steady on, Treves. Have a seat."
25841,L180515,u838,m53,TREVES,Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
25842,L180318,u838,m53,TREVES,Please do.
25843,L180317,u827,m53,CARR,Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
25844,L180316,u838,m53,TREVES,But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
25845,L180315,u827,m53,CARR,"Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time."
25846,L180314,u838,m53,TREVES,Has the response picked up?
25847,L180256,u827,m53,CARR,"Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?"
25848,L180255,u838,m53,TREVES,"No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him."
25849,L180254,u827,m53,CARR,Don't we?
25850,L180242,u827,m53,CARR,Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
25851,L180241,u838,m53,TREVES,Do you think they'll go along with us?
25852,L180240,u827,m53,CARR,"Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities."
25853,L180239,u838,m53,TREVES,"Well, yes."
25854,L180238,u827,m53,CARR,"No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?"
25855,L180237,u838,m53,TREVES,I could easily arrange...
25856,L180236,u827,m53,CARR,"You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick."
25857,L180235,u827,m53,CARR,"No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can."
25858,L180234,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes, I think I can."
25859,L180233,u827,m53,CARR,Can you imagine what his life has been like?
25860,L180227,u838,m53,TREVES,"Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness."
25861,L180226,u827,m53,CARR,Treves. Well done.
25862,L180218,u838,m53,TREVES,"Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?"
25863,L180217,u827,m53,CARR,I don't understand.
25864,L180216,u838,m53,TREVES,"How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it."
25865,L180210,u827,m53,CARR,"I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day."
25866,L180209,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him."
25867,L180208,u827,m53,CARR,"It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words."
25868,L180193,u838,m53,TREVES,"And what was that, John?"
25869,L180192,u827,m53,CARR,Oh yes?
25870,L180179,u827,m53,CARR,"Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them."
25871,L180178,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly."
25872,L180177,u827,m53,CARR,He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
25873,L180176,u838,m53,TREVES,"...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous."
25874,L180175,u827,m53,CARR,"Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?"
25875,L180174,u838,m53,TREVES,"It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear."
25876,L180151,u838,m53,TREVES,"...Yes, Sir."
25877,L180150,u827,m53,CARR,Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
25878,L180149,u838,m53,TREVES,"Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir."
25879,L180148,u827,m53,CARR,Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
25880,L180147,u838,m53,TREVES,Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
25881,L180146,u827,m53,CARR,"Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves."
25882,L180126,u827,m53,CARR,"Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry."
25883,L180125,u838,m53,TREVES,"Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee."
25884,L180124,u827,m53,CARR,"No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say ""Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,"" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee."
25885,L180123,u838,m53,TREVES,I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
25886,L180122,u827,m53,CARR,"I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are."
25887,L180121,u838,m53,TREVES,"Well sir, perhaps I should explain..."
25888,L180120,u827,m53,CARR,A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
25889,L180119,u838,m53,TREVES,"He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules."
25890,L180118,u827,m53,CARR,Good! How is the patient?
25891,L180117,u838,m53,TREVES,"Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning."
25892,L180116,u827,m53,CARR,Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
25893,L180016,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?"
25894,L180015,u827,m53,CARR,"I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him."
25895,L180014,u838,m53,TREVES,"No, more of an acquaintance."
25896,L180013,u827,m53,CARR,"Oh, is he a friend of yours?"
25897,L180012,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional."
25898,L180011,u827,m53,CARR,"What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point."
25899,L180010,u838,m53,TREVES,Yes sir.
25900,L180009,u827,m53,CARR,Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
25901,L180008,u838,m53,TREVES,"Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking."
25902,L180007,u827,m53,CARR,"Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?"
25903,L180006,u838,m53,TREVES,"No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten."
25904,L180005,u827,m53,CARR,"A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?"
25905,L180004,u827,m53,CARR,Indeed!
25906,L180003,u838,m53,TREVES,Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
25907,L180000,u827,m53,CARR,Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
25908,L179999,u838,m53,TREVES,"It's quite nutritious, sir."
25909,L179998,u827,m53,CARR,You've acquired a taste for this?
25910,L179997,u838,m53,TREVES,"Good morning, sir."
25911,L179996,u827,m53,CARR,"Good morning, Treves."
25912,L180222,u827,m53,CARR,I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
25913,L180221,u832,m53,MERRICK,I am very pleased to meet you.
25914,L180220,u827,m53,CARR,"It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick."
25915,L180213,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil..."
25916,L180212,u827,m53,CARR,"What is it, Treves?"
25917,L180205,u827,m53,CARR,"Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day."
25918,L180204,u832,m53,MERRICK,...everyone has been very kind.
25919,L180203,u827,m53,CARR,Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
25920,L180202,u832,m53,MERRICK,...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
25921,L180189,u832,m53,MERRICK,Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
25922,L180188,u827,m53,CARR,Are you comfortable here?
25923,L180187,u832,m53,MERRICK,I feel much better. Thank you.
25924,L180186,u827,m53,CARR,"I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?"
25925,L180185,u832,m53,MERRICK,I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
25926,L180184,u827,m53,CARR,How are you feeling today?
25927,L179952,u838,m53,TREVES,"He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot."
25928,L179951,u828,m53,FOX,You never mentioned his mental state.
25929,L179934,u828,m53,FOX,"Nothing of any importance, eh?"
25930,L179933,u838,m53,TREVES,I don't know what I've got.
25931,L179932,u828,m53,FOX,"Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there."
25932,L179931,u838,m53,TREVES,"You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself."
25933,L179930,u828,m53,FOX,"Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?"
25934,L179892,u838,m53,TREVES,Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
25935,L179891,u828,m53,FOX,"I say Freddie, what are you about?"
25936,L179878,u828,m53,FOX,What a mess.
25937,L179877,u838,m53,TREVES,Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
25938,L179876,u838,m53,TREVES,"Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this."
25939,L179875,u828,m53,FOX,Three quarters of an hour.
25940,L179874,u838,m53,TREVES,How long has this man been here?
25941,L180711,u829,m53,K. HEN,"I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say ""I love you"". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly."
25942,L180710,u830,m53,KATH,"Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits."
25943,L180709,u829,m53,K. HEN,"What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?"
25944,L180708,u830,m53,KATH,O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
25945,L180707,u829,m53,K. HEN,"An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel."
25946,L180706,u830,m53,KATH,"Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is ""like me""."
25947,L180705,u829,m53,K. HEN,"O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?"
25948,L180704,u830,m53,KATH,Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
25949,L180703,u829,m53,K. HEN,"Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?"
25950,L180436,u831,m53,KENDAL,Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
25951,L180435,u832,m53,MERRICK,Oh no?
25952,L180434,u831,m53,KENDAL,"Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all..."
25953,L180433,u832,m53,MERRICK,"O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
25954,L180432,u831,m53,KENDAL,"Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
25955,L180431,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
25956,L180428,u832,m53,MERRICK,"No, but I certainly shall."
25957,L180427,u831,m53,KENDAL,Have you read it?
25958,L180426,u831,m53,KENDAL,That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
25959,L180425,u832,m53,MERRICK,Romance!
25960,L180424,u831,m53,KENDAL,"It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance."
25961,L180423,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Tell me about it, please!"
25962,L180422,u831,m53,KENDAL,"Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial."
25963,L180421,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Alas, no."
25964,L180420,u831,m53,KENDAL,You've never been?
25965,L180419,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?"
25966,L180418,u831,m53,KENDAL,"Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there."
25967,L180417,u832,m53,MERRICK,Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
25968,L180416,u832,m53,MERRICK,Yes.
25969,L180415,u831,m53,KENDAL,"She's very pretty, your mother."
25970,L180414,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother."
25971,L180413,u831,m53,KENDAL,I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
25972,L180412,u831,m53,KENDAL,I knew you'd understand. Here.
25973,L180411,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Oh, no."
25974,L180410,u831,m53,KENDAL,"I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward."
25975,L180409,u832,m53,MERRICK,Good day...!
25976,L180699,u838,m53,TREVES,Yes.
25977,L180698,u831,m53,KENDAL,"Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite..."
25978,L180697,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do."
25979,L180696,u831,m53,KENDAL,Is he... dying then?
25980,L180695,u838,m53,TREVES,"And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain."
25981,L180694,u831,m53,KENDAL,How awful for John.
25982,L180693,u838,m53,TREVES,"I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain."
25983,L180692,u831,m53,KENDAL,"Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead."
25984,L180691,u838,m53,TREVES,"I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited."
25985,L180690,u831,m53,KENDAL,It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
25986,L180408,u831,m53,KENDAL,"Good day, Mr. Merrick."
25987,L180407,u838,m53,TREVES,"John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick."
25988,L180661,u837,m53,PLUMED DWARF,"You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction."
25989,L180660,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Oh, yes."
25990,L180659,u837,m53,PLUMED DWARF,Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
25991,L180658,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Oh no, my friend..."
25992,L180657,u837,m53,PLUMED DWARF,"I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had."
25993,L180646,u837,m53,PLUMED DWARF,Won't be a moment.
25994,L180645,u832,m53,MERRICK,Yes.
25995,L180644,u837,m53,PLUMED DWARF,Of course! You want out?
25996,L180643,u832,m53,MERRICK,You're English.
25997,L180642,u837,m53,PLUMED DWARF,Want to come out?
25998,L180641,u832,m53,MERRICK,y-y-yes--
25999,L180640,u837,m53,PLUMED DWARF,You alright?
26000,L180402,u835,m53,NORA,"Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick."
26001,L180401,u832,m53,MERRICK,I'll have to find some more.
26002,L180399,u832,m53,MERRICK,...I learned a long time ago.
26003,L180398,u835,m53,NORA,"The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?"
26004,L180397,u832,m53,MERRICK,The main spire.
26005,L180396,u835,m53,NORA,What's this?
26006,L180395,u835,m53,NORA,"It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all."
26007,L180394,u832,m53,MERRICK,"I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away."
26008,L180393,u835,m53,NORA,"The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!"
26009,L180392,u835,m53,NORA,Where did you get this box?
26010,L180391,u832,m53,MERRICK,Thank you... very much.
26011,L180390,u835,m53,NORA,"But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good."
26012,L180389,u832,m53,MERRICK,Yes.
26013,L180388,u835,m53,NORA,"What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right."
26014,L180385,u832,m53,MERRICK,Good morning.
26015,L180384,u835,m53,NORA,"Good morning, Mr. Merrick."
26016,L180329,u832,m53,MERRICK,"No, nothing."
26017,L180328,u835,m53,NORA,"Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now."
26018,L180327,u832,m53,MERRICK,Thank you very much.
26019,L180325,u832,m53,MERRICK,Yes.
26020,L180324,u835,m53,NORA,"Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?"
26021,L180732,u832,m53,MERRICK,"You too, my friend. Goodnight."
26022,L180731,u838,m53,TREVES,Goodnight John. Sleep well.
26023,L180729,u838,m53,TREVES,"No, no, I wouldn't change a thing."
26024,L180728,u832,m53,MERRICK,Then I shouldn't change anything?
26025,L180727,u838,m53,TREVES,"No, John, not one that I can see."
26026,L180726,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?"
26027,L180725,u838,m53,TREVES,Yes John?
26028,L180723,u838,m53,TREVES,"I'm glad, John. Goodnight."
26029,L180722,u832,m53,MERRICK,Oh yes! It was wonderful!
26030,L180721,u838,m53,TREVES,"Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening."
26031,L180720,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Yes, very soon."
26032,L180719,u838,m53,TREVES,"Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?"
26033,L180716,u838,m53,TREVES,"It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you."
26034,L180715,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Oh no, I couldn't."
26035,L180714,u838,m53,TREVES,"Stand up, John. Let them see you."
26036,L180689,u838,m53,TREVES,John.... how can you ever forgive me?
26037,L180688,u832,m53,MERRICK,Mr. Treves! Treves.
26038,L180551,u832,m53,MERRICK,Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
26039,L180550,u838,m53,TREVES,Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
26040,L180549,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves."
26041,L180548,u838,m53,TREVES,Is it the one you wanted?
26042,L180547,u838,m53,TREVES,"There is one more thing, John. Here."
26043,L180546,u832,m53,MERRICK,My home.
26044,L180545,u832,m53,MERRICK,Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
26045,L180544,u838,m53,TREVES,Yes.
26046,L180543,u832,m53,MERRICK,You did this for me?
26047,L180542,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes, John."
26048,L180541,u832,m53,MERRICK,...my... home?
26049,L180483,u832,m53,MERRICK,"You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?"
26050,L180482,u838,m53,TREVES,"You want a dressing bag, John?"
26051,L180481,u838,m53,TREVES,"Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?"
26052,L180480,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you."
26053,L180479,u838,m53,TREVES,"How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?"
26054,L180478,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!"
26055,L180477,u838,m53,TREVES,The cathedral is coming along nicely.
26056,L180471,u832,m53,MERRICK,I thought as much.
26057,L180470,u838,m53,TREVES,"No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you."
26058,L180469,u832,m53,MERRICK,...Can you cure me?
26059,L180468,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes, John?"
26060,L180467,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time..."
26061,L180466,u838,m53,TREVES,"Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die."
26062,L180465,u832,m53,MERRICK,"When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?"
26063,L180406,u838,m53,TREVES,"John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?"
26064,L180405,u832,m53,MERRICK,Good morning.
26065,L180404,u838,m53,TREVES,"Good morning, John."
26066,L180378,u832,m53,MERRICK,Here.
26067,L180377,u838,m53,TREVES,Your mother?
26068,L180376,u832,m53,MERRICK,Would you... would you like to see my mother?
26069,L180368,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice."
26070,L180367,u838,m53,TREVES,"Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends."
26071,L180366,u832,m53,MERRICK,The Children. Where are your children
26072,L180365,u838,m53,TREVES,Of course.
26073,L180364,u832,m53,MERRICK,The children! May I see?
26074,L180363,u838,m53,TREVES,"Oh, our relatives... the children."
26075,L180362,u832,m53,MERRICK,Who are they of?
26076,L180361,u838,m53,TREVES,Oh yes.
26077,L180360,u832,m53,MERRICK,I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
26078,L180359,u838,m53,TREVES,"Not at all, John."
26079,L180358,u832,m53,MERRICK,It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
26080,L180357,u838,m53,TREVES,"How is your tea, John?"
26081,L180356,u832,m53,MERRICK,Ohhh...
26082,L180355,u838,m53,TREVES,"That's a canopy, John."
26083,L180354,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?"
26084,L180339,u832,m53,MERRICK,I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
26085,L180338,u838,m53,TREVES,John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
26086,L180332,u838,m53,TREVES,"When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best."
26087,L180331,u832,m53,MERRICK,Thank you very much.
26088,L180330,u838,m53,TREVES,"You look splendid, John."
26089,L180312,u838,m53,TREVES,"I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?"
26090,L180311,u832,m53,MERRICK,How long will I stay here?
26091,L180310,u838,m53,TREVES,Of course! What did you think?
26092,L180309,u832,m53,MERRICK,The hospital?
26093,L180308,u838,m53,TREVES,Yes.
26094,L180307,u832,m53,MERRICK,This... is my new home?
26095,L180297,u838,m53,TREVES,"Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular."
26096,L180296,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?"
26097,L180295,u838,m53,TREVES,Good evening. How are you feeling?
26098,L180232,u838,m53,TREVES,"We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?"
26099,L180231,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me."
26100,L180230,u838,m53,TREVES,I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
26101,L180229,u832,m53,MERRICK,You did not ask me.
26102,L180228,u838,m53,TREVES,"Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?"
26103,L180196,u832,m53,MERRICK,But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
26104,L180195,u838,m53,TREVES,...Yes potatoes... but...
26105,L180191,u832,m53,MERRICK,Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
26106,L180190,u838,m53,TREVES,Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
26107,L180182,u832,m53,MERRICK,Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
26108,L180181,u838,m53,TREVES,"John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm."
26109,L180173,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!"
26110,L180172,u838,m53,TREVES,"Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say ""May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm."" And you will say..."
26111,L180171,u832,m53,MERRICK,Righteousness for his namesake.
26112,L180170,u838,m53,TREVES,Righteousness...
26113,L180169,u832,m53,MERRICK,"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness..."
26114,L180109,u832,m53,MERRICK,"Hello, my name is John Merrick."
26115,L180108,u838,m53,TREVES,"Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?"
26116,L180104,u832,m53,MERRICK,Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
26117,L180103,u838,m53,TREVES,"Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ..."
26118,L180102,u832,m53,MERRICK,Mmmerrick.
26119,L180101,u838,m53,TREVES,"Say ""Mmmerrick."""
26120,L180100,u832,m53,MERRICK,Mmmerrick.
26121,L180099,u838,m53,TREVES,"Say ""Mmmerrick."""
26122,L180098,u832,m53,MERRICK,Merrick...
26123,L180097,u838,m53,TREVES,"Say ""Merrick""."
26124,L180096,u832,m53,MERRICK,John... Merrick
26125,L180095,u838,m53,TREVES,John Merrick.
26126,L180094,u832,m53,MERRICK,My... name is...
26127,L180093,u838,m53,TREVES,My name is...
26128,L180092,u832,m53,MERRICK,Hello...
26129,L180091,u838,m53,TREVES,"Excellent! Now, say... ""Hello"""
26130,L180090,u832,m53,MERRICK,Yes.
26131,L180089,u838,m53,TREVES,Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
26132,L180088,u832,m53,MERRICK,Yes!
26133,L180087,u838,m53,TREVES,"That's much better. I could understand that ""yes""."
26134,L180086,u832,m53,MERRICK,Yyess.
26135,L180085,u838,m53,TREVES,Yyyess.
26136,L180084,u832,m53,MERRICK,...Yyes
26137,L180083,u838,m53,TREVES,Yes John!
26138,L180082,u832,m53,MERRICK,Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
26139,L180540,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"Welcome home, John."
26140,L180539,u838,m53,TREVES,"So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here."
26141,L180493,u838,m53,TREVES,John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
26142,L180492,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,Well...
26143,L180491,u838,m53,TREVES,"You don't think it's too gaudy, do you."
26144,L180490,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,A dressing bag?
26145,L180489,u838,m53,TREVES,Yes. John wants it.
26146,L180488,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,Very smart indeed.
26147,L180487,u838,m53,TREVES,A dressing bag.
26148,L180486,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,Yes sir.  What's that?
26149,L180485,u838,m53,TREVES,"Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office."
26150,L180484,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick."
26151,L180463,u838,m53,TREVES,"You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me."
26152,L180462,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it."
26153,L180461,u838,m53,TREVES,"Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived."
26154,L180460,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends."
26155,L180459,u838,m53,TREVES,"Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital..."
26156,L180458,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir."
26157,L180457,u838,m53,TREVES,"Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue."
26158,L180456,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you."
26159,L180455,u838,m53,TREVES,"Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening."
26160,L180453,u838,m53,TREVES,"I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity."
26161,L180452,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,Watery headed bunch.
26162,L180113,u838,m53,TREVES,"I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?"
26163,L180112,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here."
26164,L180111,u838,m53,TREVES,"We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him."
26165,L180110,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"Good Lord, Mr. Treves!"
26166,L180076,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir."
26167,L180075,u838,m53,TREVES,"He's had his share of ""smacks"", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man."
26168,L180071,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it."
26169,L180070,u838,m53,TREVES,"No, he's very upset about something."
26170,L180069,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"Won't come out, eh?"
26171,L180068,u838,m53,TREVES,"Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning."
26172,L180067,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?"
26173,L180041,u838,m53,TREVES,Yes! The workhouse!
26174,L180040,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,The workhouse.
26175,L180033,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes... Yes, let's go in."
26176,L180032,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,"Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?"
26177,L180031,u838,m53,TREVES,"Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him..."
26178,L180030,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,I've heard.
26179,L180029,u838,m53,TREVES,"Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance."
26180,L180028,u833,m53,MOTHERSHEAD,Fine.
26181,L180027,u838,m53,TREVES,"Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?"
26182,L180601,u838,m53,TREVES,YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
26183,L180600,u834,m53,NIGHT PORTER,"YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money."
26184,L180599,u838,m53,TREVES,"YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?"
26185,L180598,u834,m53,NIGHT PORTER,"When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound."
26186,L180597,u838,m53,TREVES,HE'S GONE!
26187,L180596,u834,m53,NIGHT PORTER,"Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all."
26188,L180595,u838,m53,TREVES,Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
26189,L180594,u834,m53,NIGHT PORTER,"I... I don't know what you mean, Sir."
26190,L180593,u838,m53,TREVES,WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
26191,L179912,u838,m53,TREVES,I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
26192,L179911,u836,m53,OWNER,Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
26193,L179910,u838,m53,TREVES,"So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?"
26194,L179904,u836,m53,OWNER,Never mind. I'm the owner.
26195,L179903,u838,m53,TREVES,Pardon me?
26196,L179902,u836,m53,OWNER,Handsomely?... Who sent you?
26197,L179901,u838,m53,TREVES,I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
26198,L179900,u836,m53,OWNER,"I don't think so. No sir, we're closed."
26199,L179899,u838,m53,TREVES,Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
26200,L179898,u836,m53,OWNER,"And who might you be, sir?"
26201,L179897,u838,m53,TREVES,Are you the proprietor?
26202,L188218,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you..."
26203,L188217,u839,m54,AUD,It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
26204,L188210,u839,m54,AUD,"But, Father, it IS!"
26205,L188209,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,It's all right! It isn't happening!
26206,L187976,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
26207,L187975,u839,m54,AUD,It's your fantasy...
26208,L187974,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day."
26209,L187973,u839,m54,AUD,"There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic..."
26210,L187972,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic..."
26211,L187971,u839,m54,AUD,"It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other...."
26212,L187967,u839,m54,AUD,You're losing your temper!
26213,L187966,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
26214,L187964,u839,m54,AUD,"There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself."
26215,L187963,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Well... where is he?
26216,L187959,u839,m54,AUD,There IS no one.
26217,L187958,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
26218,L187957,u839,m54,AUD,"Who, Father?"
26219,L187956,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Right! Where is he?
26220,L187952,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Open up! I know you're in there!
26221,L187951,u839,m54,AUD,Ah! It's my father!
26222,L187950,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Open up! I know you're in there!
26223,L188310,u840,m54,ERIK,"But, Aud... I... I came to find someone..."
26224,L188309,u839,m54,AUD,I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
26225,L188308,u840,m54,ERIK,No... no...
26226,L188307,u839,m54,AUD,Then I shall come too.
26227,L188304,u839,m54,AUD,No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
26228,L188303,u840,m54,ERIK,There is something I must ask the Gods...
26229,L188302,u839,m54,AUD,Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
26230,L188301,u840,m54,ERIK,Not quite...
26231,L188300,u839,m54,AUD,Erik! You've done what you came to do!
26232,L188298,u840,m54,ERIK,The second note to wake the Gods...
26233,L188297,u839,m54,AUD,The second note.
26234,L188282,u839,m54,AUD,Then let go!
26235,L188281,u840,m54,ERIK,Yes -- I believe you do.
26236,L188280,u839,m54,AUD,You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
26237,L188279,u840,m54,ERIK,I... but I...
26238,L188278,u839,m54,AUD,Do you believe I love you?
26239,L188277,u840,m54,ERIK,Of course.
26240,L188276,u839,m54,AUD,YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
26241,L188272,u840,m54,ERIK,I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
26242,L188271,u839,m54,AUD,No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
26243,L188258,u840,m54,ERIK,That's right!
26244,L188257,u839,m54,AUD,No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
26245,L188052,u839,m54,AUD,No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
26246,L188051,u840,m54,ERIK,And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
26247,L188049,u840,m54,ERIK,"Goodbye, Aud..."
26248,L188048,u839,m54,AUD,But you don't realize....
26249,L188047,u840,m54,ERIK,"No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him."
26250,L188046,u839,m54,AUD,Erik. You don't understand.
26251,L188045,u840,m54,ERIK,I'll bring it back.
26252,L188044,u839,m54,AUD,No!
26253,L188041,u839,m54,AUD,Why?
26254,L188040,u840,m54,ERIK,Where's the Cloak Invisible?
26255,L188039,u839,m54,AUD,"I mean, you could have killed yourself."
26256,L188038,u840,m54,ERIK,Just give me a hand.
26257,L187989,u839,m54,AUD,"But, Erik..."
26258,L187988,u840,m54,ERIK,Halfdan the Black.
26259,L187987,u839,m54,AUD,Who?
26260,L187986,u840,m54,ERIK,We mustn't let him land!
26261,L187984,u840,m54,ERIK,And the week before that?
26262,L187983,u839,m54,AUD,You're as bad as my father.
26263,L187982,u840,m54,ERIK,Five this week; how many the week before?
26264,L187981,u839,m54,AUD,That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
26265,L187980,u840,m54,ERIK,And I thought you said it was something special...
26266,L187979,u839,m54,AUD,"Oh, for goodness' sake!"
26267,L187978,u840,m54,ERIK,"""The fifth one this week""!"
26268,L187977,u839,m54,AUD,The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
26269,L187949,u840,m54,ERIK,I've never been to bed with anybody!
26270,L187948,u839,m54,AUD,I've never LOVED anybody!
26271,L187947,u840,m54,ERIK,"You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?"
26272,L187946,u839,m54,AUD,Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
26273,L187945,u840,m54,ERIK,We never went to bed together.
26274,L187944,u839,m54,AUD,But you LOVED her all the same...
26275,L187943,u840,m54,ERIK,"Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well..."
26276,L187942,u839,m54,AUD,What was she like?
26277,L187941,u840,m54,ERIK,It was different...
26278,L187940,u839,m54,AUD,What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
26279,L187939,u840,m54,ERIK,HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
26280,L187938,u839,m54,AUD,"No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?"
26281,L187937,u840,m54,ERIK,You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
26282,L187936,u839,m54,AUD,"No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?"
26283,L187935,u840,m54,ERIK,"What... you mean ""got into bed with"" them?"
26284,L187934,u839,m54,AUD,Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
26285,L187853,u839,m54,AUD,But surely you know...?
26286,L187852,u840,m54,ERIK,Yes.
26287,L187851,u839,m54,AUD,WHY?
26288,L187848,u839,m54,AUD,Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
26289,L187847,u840,m54,ERIK,What?
26290,L187846,u839,m54,AUD,PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
26291,L187845,u840,m54,ERIK,What's the matter?
26292,L187843,u840,m54,ERIK,These? What are THESE? They're swords.
26293,L187842,u839,m54,AUD,Those things in your hands.
26294,L187841,u840,m54,ERIK,What are what?
26295,L187840,u839,m54,AUD,Please! Please! What are those?
26296,L187836,u839,m54,AUD,"Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil."
26297,L187835,u840,m54,ERIK,"How d'you KNOW we're ""friends""?"
26298,L187834,u839,m54,AUD,"Well, of course. We always welcome friends."
26299,L187833,u840,m54,ERIK,WELCOME?
26300,L187832,u839,m54,AUD,I said welcome.
26301,L187831,u840,m54,ERIK,WHAT did you say?
26302,L188245,u851,m54,LOKI,SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
26303,L188244,u840,m54,ERIK,We blew the Horn Resounding.
26304,L188243,u851,m54,LOKI,How do we know this is the way?
26305,L188122,u851,m54,LOKI,What d'you mean?
26306,L188121,u840,m54,ERIK,But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
26307,L188118,u851,m54,LOKI,It was my master Keitel's idea.
26308,L188117,u840,m54,ERIK,But --
26309,L188115,u851,m54,LOKI,Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
26310,L188114,u840,m54,ERIK,LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
26311,L187468,u841,m54,FREYA,That I cannot tell you.
26312,L187467,u840,m54,ERIK,"And will the dead ever return, Freya?"
26313,L187464,u840,m54,ERIK,I will go and wake them up!
26314,L187463,u841,m54,FREYA,"The Gods are asleep, Erik."
26315,L187462,u840,m54,ERIK,Is there nothing men can do?
26316,L187458,u841,m54,FREYA,"The sky WAS blue, Erik... once."
26317,L187457,u840,m54,ERIK,Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
26318,L187456,u841,m54,FREYA,But have you ever seen it? Think back...
26319,L187455,u840,m54,ERIK,The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
26320,L187454,u841,m54,FREYA,"Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?"
26321,L187452,u841,m54,FREYA,"Is it summer or winter, Erik?"
26322,L187451,u840,m54,ERIK,"It is day, of course, Freya."
26323,L187450,u841,m54,FREYA,"Is it night or day, Erik?"
26324,L187449,u840,m54,ERIK,I see the world.
26325,L187448,u841,m54,FREYA,"What do you see, Erik?"
26326,L187445,u841,m54,FREYA,They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
26327,L187444,u840,m54,ERIK,I shouldn't have come.
26328,L187443,u841,m54,FREYA,"Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the ""Viking""?"
26329,L188187,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,The important thing is not to panic.
26330,L188186,u840,m54,ERIK,But it IS! Look!
26331,L188140,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
26332,L188139,u840,m54,ERIK,"Yes... oh, yes..."
26333,L188138,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?"
26334,L188137,u840,m54,ERIK,Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
26335,L188136,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Is there something the matter with it?
26336,L188011,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand."
26337,L188010,u840,m54,ERIK,You don't know Halfdan the Black.
26338,L188009,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
26339,L188008,u840,m54,ERIK,He wants to kill US!
26340,L188007,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Don't talk nonsense.
26341,L188006,u840,m54,ERIK,"Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!"
26342,L188005,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Why?
26343,L188004,u840,m54,ERIK,He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
26344,L188001,u840,m54,ERIK,"They'll be more than ""hurt"" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!"
26345,L188000,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
26346,L187997,u840,m54,ERIK,You've got to let me go!
26347,L187996,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
26348,L187932,u840,m54,ERIK,Yes?
26349,L187931,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,I'll tell you what...
26350,L187928,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing..."
26351,L187927,u840,m54,ERIK,"The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf."
26352,L187926,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"Well, how d'you think I feel?"
26353,L187925,u840,m54,ERIK,Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
26354,L187924,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
26355,L187923,u840,m54,ERIK,No.
26356,L187922,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?"
26357,L187921,u840,m54,ERIK,"No, no... It was very... er, nice."
26358,L187920,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,We're just not a very musical nation...
26359,L187901,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes ""TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"""
26360,L187900,u840,m54,ERIK,No.
26361,L187899,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
26362,L187898,u840,m54,ERIK,Really.
26363,L187897,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,REALLY?
26364,L187896,u840,m54,ERIK,Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
26365,L187893,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,You're just saying that.
26366,L187892,u840,m54,ERIK,Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
26367,L187889,u840,m54,ERIK,No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
26368,L187888,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,But you don't want to hear it.
26369,L187887,u840,m54,ERIK,I'm sure it's lovely.
26370,L187886,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,A lot of people like our singing.
26371,L187885,u840,m54,ERIK,"Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is..."
26372,L187884,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
26373,L187883,u840,m54,ERIK,"Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --"
26374,L187882,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?"
26375,L187881,u840,m54,ERIK,"That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're..."
26376,L187880,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Would you like us to sing to you?
26377,L187869,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Well... isn't it great?
26378,L187868,u840,m54,ERIK,"Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing."
26379,L187867,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
26380,L187866,u840,m54,ERIK,How?
26381,L187858,u849,m54,KING ARNULF,"The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves."
26382,L187857,u840,m54,ERIK,No... we don't...
26383,L188390,u840,m54,ERIK,I don't know! I just did!
26384,L188389,u846,m54,HELGA,Why should you care?
26385,L188341,u840,m54,ERIK,Odin!
26386,L188340,u846,m54,HELGA,You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
26387,L188339,u840,m54,ERIK,Is THAT Odin?
26388,L188332,u840,m54,ERIK,Well... no...
26389,L188331,u846,m54,HELGA,Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
26390,L188330,u840,m54,ERIK,I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
26391,L188329,u846,m54,HELGA,What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
26392,L188328,u840,m54,ERIK,Why?
26393,L188327,u846,m54,HELGA,What a stupid idea.
26394,L188326,u840,m54,ERIK,I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
26395,L187409,u840,m54,ERIK,Tell me your name?
26396,L187408,u846,m54,HELGA,Why... should YOU care?
26397,L187407,u840,m54,ERIK,Why should you care?
26398,L187406,u846,m54,HELGA,I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
26399,L187405,u840,m54,ERIK,You told them I raped you -- why?
26400,L187404,u846,m54,HELGA,"Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts..."
26401,L187403,u840,m54,ERIK,I didn't mean to!
26402,L187402,u846,m54,HELGA,Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
26403,L187393,u840,m54,ERIK,"Oh, thanks."
26404,L187392,u846,m54,HELGA,Aaagh! Rape!
26405,L187391,u840,m54,ERIK,Louder.
26406,L187390,u846,m54,HELGA,Ah.
26407,L187389,u840,m54,ERIK,Scream.
26408,L187388,u846,m54,HELGA,And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
26409,L187387,u840,m54,ERIK,I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
26410,L187386,u846,m54,HELGA,Well you started it.
26411,L187385,u840,m54,ERIK,Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
26412,L187384,u846,m54,HELGA,"But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out."
26413,L187383,u840,m54,ERIK,"To pay for the next expedition, of course."
26414,L187382,u846,m54,HELGA,Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
26415,L187381,u840,m54,ERIK,Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
26416,L187380,u846,m54,HELGA,"What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?"
26417,L187379,u840,m54,ERIK,"Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all."
26418,L187378,u846,m54,HELGA,"You DON'T like it, do you?"
26419,L187377,u840,m54,ERIK,About NOT raping you...
26420,L187376,u846,m54,HELGA,About raping me?
26421,L187375,u840,m54,ERIK,I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
26422,L187374,u846,m54,HELGA,"What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me..."
26423,L187373,u840,m54,ERIK,I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
26424,L187372,u846,m54,HELGA,What?
26425,L187371,u840,m54,ERIK,I don't suppose... no...
26426,L187370,u846,m54,HELGA,"Oh, get it over with."
26427,L187369,u840,m54,ERIK,"No. It isn't rape then, is it?"
26428,L187368,u846,m54,HELGA,What -- rape?
26429,L187367,u840,m54,ERIK,"No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people..."
26430,L187366,u846,m54,HELGA,You don't love ME.
26431,L187365,u840,m54,ERIK,Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
26432,L187363,u840,m54,ERIK,Sh!
26433,L187362,u846,m54,HELGA,It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
26434,L187361,u840,m54,ERIK,Shut up.
26435,L187360,u846,m54,HELGA,What about the raping?
26436,L187359,u840,m54,ERIK,Yes.
26437,L187358,u846,m54,HELGA,"Looting and pillaging, eh?"
26438,L187357,u840,m54,ERIK,Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
26439,L187356,u846,m54,HELGA,Have you done this sort of thing before?
26440,L188035,u856,m54,THORFINN,Don't you FEEL it?
26441,L188034,u840,m54,ERIK,It's not magic! It's just a trick!
26442,L188028,u856,m54,THORFINN,I know. I know.
26443,L188027,u840,m54,ERIK,"But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!"
26444,L188018,u856,m54,THORFINN,He wants to KILL us.
26445,L188017,u840,m54,ERIK,I know!
26446,L188016,u856,m54,THORFINN,Halfdan the Black's here!
26447,L187860,u840,m54,ERIK,You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
26448,L187859,u856,m54,THORFINN,That's terrible!
26449,L187828,u856,m54,THORFINN,"You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make ""friends""."
26450,L187827,u840,m54,ERIK,What's wrong with making friends?
26451,L187822,u840,m54,ERIK,No.
26452,L187821,u856,m54,THORFINN,Let's hack her to pieces.
26453,L187805,u856,m54,THORFINN,Very deep... usually...
26454,L187804,u840,m54,ERIK,How deep IS the ocean?
26455,L187755,u840,m54,ERIK,It saved my father!
26456,L187754,u856,m54,THORFINN,Erik! Row! What are you doing?
26457,L187698,u840,m54,ERIK,I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
26458,L187697,u856,m54,THORFINN,It's Halfdan the Black!
26459,L187694,u840,m54,ERIK,"Come on, move it!"
26460,L187693,u856,m54,THORFINN,What are you talking about?
26461,L187650,u840,m54,ERIK,He was lucky...  Sit there.
26462,L187649,u856,m54,THORFINN,Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
26463,L187505,u840,m54,ERIK,What?
26464,L187504,u856,m54,THORFINN,But...
26465,L187503,u840,m54,ERIK,"""But"" what?"
26466,L187497,u840,m54,ERIK,Find it... AND cross it!
26467,L187496,u856,m54,THORFINN,FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
26468,L187438,u844,m54,GRANDFATHER,That's my boy!
26469,L187437,u840,m54,ERIK,I... I... KILLED her...
26470,L187436,u844,m54,GRANDFATHER,So? What'd you do to her?
26471,L187435,u840,m54,ERIK,She got me thinking...
26472,L187434,u844,m54,GRANDFATHER,It's always the women that start the trouble.
26473,L187433,u840,m54,ERIK,I met this girl...
26474,L187432,u844,m54,GRANDFATHER,Who have you been talking to?
26475,L187431,u840,m54,ERIK,"Where does it all get us, Grandpa?"
26476,L187430,u844,m54,GRANDFATHER,"You talking piffle, son?"
26477,L187429,u840,m54,ERIK,"We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet..."
26478,L187428,u844,m54,GRANDFATHER,What?
26479,L187427,u840,m54,ERIK,What's it all about?
26480,L187426,u844,m54,GRANDFATHER,We're missing all the fun...
26481,L187745,u847,m54,IVAR,Make your mind up.
26482,L187744,u840,m54,ERIK,Faster!
26483,L187739,u847,m54,IVAR,Sorry!
26484,L187738,u840,m54,ERIK,Slower! In... Out...
26485,L187733,u847,m54,IVAR,Sorry.
26486,L187732,u840,m54,ERIK,Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
26487,L187709,u840,m54,ERIK,Row! Row! Row!
26488,L187708,u847,m54,IVAR,"I want to die...  No, I don't!"
26489,L187646,u840,m54,ERIK,"Well, you ARE!"
26490,L187645,u847,m54,IVAR,He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
26491,L188169,u840,m54,ERIK,Look out!
26492,L188168,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,What did he say?
26493,L188066,u840,m54,ERIK,You'll see!
26494,L188065,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,"What ""magic"" have you brought, Erik?"
26495,L188031,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
26496,L188030,u840,m54,ERIK,"What ""magic""?"
26497,L188029,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,It's magic.
26498,L187811,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,The sun! That's it!
26499,L187810,u840,m54,ERIK,"Look, the sky is blue..."
26500,L187752,u840,m54,ERIK,ROW!
26501,L187751,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,SHUT UP!
26502,L187656,u840,m54,ERIK,Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
26503,L187655,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
26504,L187642,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,You may need a real Berserk.
26505,L187641,u840,m54,ERIK,What are YOU doing here?
26506,L188357,u852,m54,ODIN,Look... Erik...
26507,L188356,u840,m54,ERIK,But you're the Gods!
26508,L188355,u852,m54,ODIN,Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
26509,L188351,u840,m54,ERIK,Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
26510,L188350,u852,m54,ODIN,So?
26511,L188349,u840,m54,ERIK,Because... you're... you're the Gods....
26512,L188348,u852,m54,ODIN,Why should WE care?
26513,L188347,u840,m54,ERIK,Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
26514,L188346,u852,m54,ODIN,We don't HAVE to help anybody.
26515,L188345,u840,m54,ERIK,You must help us.
26516,L188394,u853,m54,SNORRI,No! Arrgh!
26517,L188393,u840,m54,ERIK,You'll be sucked down too!
26518,L188392,u853,m54,SNORRI,I've got you!
26519,L188391,u840,m54,ERIK,"No! Let go, Snorri!"
26520,L188129,u840,m54,ERIK,Oh... I feel a little... oh...
26521,L188128,u853,m54,SNORRI,Weren't we supposed to?
26522,L188060,u840,m54,ERIK,To the oars!
26523,L188059,u853,m54,SNORRI,A magic dishcloth.
26524,L187791,u853,m54,SNORRI,Like fish.
26525,L187790,u840,m54,ERIK,Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
26526,L187786,u840,m54,ERIK,"Well, come on!"
26527,L187785,u853,m54,SNORRI,First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
26528,L187760,u853,m54,SNORRI,Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
26529,L187759,u840,m54,ERIK,Row!
26530,L187658,u853,m54,SNORRI,Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
26531,L187657,u840,m54,ERIK,That's better.
26532,L187653,u853,m54,SNORRI,Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
26533,L187652,u840,m54,ERIK,"That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there."
26534,L187651,u853,m54,SNORRI,You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
26535,L187640,u853,m54,SNORRI,Trust me to get the missionary.
26536,L187639,u840,m54,ERIK,"Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there..."
26537,L187638,u853,m54,SNORRI,It's SO nice to feel wanted.
26538,L187637,u840,m54,ERIK,Now stop it!
26539,L187636,u853,m54,SNORRI,Thank you VERY much indeed.
26540,L187509,u840,m54,ERIK,No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
26541,L187508,u853,m54,SNORRI,You mean we'd be dead?
26542,L187611,u843,m54,GRANDAD,"No, don't say anything else!"
26543,L187610,u840,m54,ERIK,Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
26544,L187609,u843,m54,GRANDAD,I think we should go...
26545,L187604,u840,m54,ERIK,Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
26546,L187603,u843,m54,GRANDAD,Just say something cheerful.
26547,L187602,u840,m54,ERIK,What's the matter with them?
26548,L187595,u840,m54,ERIK,Oh... er... yes...
26549,L187594,u843,m54,GRANDAD,You need to say a bit more than that!
26550,L187490,u840,m54,ERIK,Nobody gets killed.
26551,L187489,u843,m54,GRANDAD,Who gets killed?
26552,L187488,u840,m54,ERIK,There is another way.
26553,L188247,u840,m54,ERIK,What are you talking about?
26554,L188246,u848,m54,KEITEL,"Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!"
26555,L188058,u848,m54,KEITEL,What is it?
26556,L188057,u840,m54,ERIK,"So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!"
26557,L187824,u840,m54,ERIK,How about making friends?
26558,L187823,u848,m54,KEITEL,"Well, what else do we do?"
26559,L187705,u848,m54,KEITEL,But...
26560,L187704,u840,m54,ERIK,"And you, Keitel Blacksmith."
26561,L187701,u848,m54,KEITEL,But how could he know... unless...
26562,L187700,u840,m54,ERIK,What do you think?
26563,L187648,u840,m54,ERIK,What's the matter with Bjorn?
26564,L187647,u848,m54,KEITEL,Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
26565,L187613,u840,m54,ERIK,Keitel Blacksmith?
26566,L187612,u848,m54,KEITEL,"Wait, Erik!"
26567,L188306,u840,m54,ERIK,I have to go...
26568,L188305,u854,m54,SVEN,I came to find my grandfather.
26569,L188231,u854,m54,SVEN,Let me do something for myself for a change!
26570,L188230,u840,m54,ERIK,Sven!
26571,L188223,u854,m54,SVEN,Over the Edge of the World.
26572,L188222,u840,m54,ERIK,We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
26573,L187838,u840,m54,ERIK,Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
26574,L187837,u854,m54,SVEN,Hy-Brasil?
26575,L187818,u840,m54,ERIK,She MUST have a knife or something...
26576,L187817,u854,m54,SVEN,She hasn't got any.
26577,L187750,u854,m54,SVEN,DEATH!
26578,L187749,u840,m54,ERIK,ROW!
26579,L187644,u840,m54,ERIK,We haven't got a spare place.
26580,L187643,u854,m54,SVEN,"I AM one, Dad!"
26581,L187635,u854,m54,SVEN,I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
26582,L187634,u840,m54,ERIK,"Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?"
26583,L187633,u854,m54,SVEN,Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
26584,L187632,u840,m54,ERIK,It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
26585,L187631,u854,m54,SVEN,"Look, I bagged it last week."
26586,L187627,u854,m54,SVEN,I was sitting there.
26587,L187626,u840,m54,ERIK,"Hey, you two! What's going on?"
26588,L187511,u840,m54,ERIK,I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
26589,L187510,u854,m54,SVEN,But HOW?
26590,L187507,u840,m54,ERIK,We'd be the first!
26591,L187506,u854,m54,SVEN,Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
26592,L187501,u840,m54,ERIK,What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
26593,L187500,u854,m54,SVEN,"Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik."
26594,L187495,u840,m54,ERIK,What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
26595,L187494,u854,m54,SVEN,"What are you talking about, Erik?"
26596,L187479,u854,m54,SVEN,I will join my grandfather there.
26597,L187478,u840,m54,ERIK,"And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?"
26598,L187584,u842,m54,GIRL,Please.
26599,L187583,u850,m54,LEIF,That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
26600,L187581,u842,m54,GIRL,What d'you expect me to do?
26601,L187580,u850,m54,LEIF,You will wait?
26602,L187579,u842,m54,GIRL,Yeah... well...
26603,L187578,u850,m54,LEIF,Bye... sorry...
26604,L187577,u842,m54,GIRL,"Bye, Leif."
26605,L188075,u845,m54,HARALD,"Well, where is he then?"
26606,L188074,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,He hasn't.
26607,L188073,u845,m54,HARALD,Vanish into thin air?
26608,L188072,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,Do what?
26609,L188071,u845,m54,HARALD,How did he do that?
26610,L187798,u845,m54,HARALD,Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
26611,L187797,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,What do we have to do?
26612,L187796,u845,m54,HARALD,It can't do you any HARM...
26613,L187735,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,The Dragon...
26614,L187734,u845,m54,HARALD,What's all the panic about?
26615,L187674,u853,m54,SNORRI,I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
26616,L187673,u845,m54,HARALD,"Quite... MY lord... said: ""The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."""
26617,L187672,u853,m54,SNORRI,Your lord.
26618,L187671,u845,m54,HARALD,"You know, my son, our lord said..."
26619,L187592,u845,m54,HARALD,"No, it is NOT."
26620,L187591,u853,m54,SNORRI,"Same thing, isn't it?"
26621,L187590,u845,m54,HARALD,"Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian."
26622,L187589,u853,m54,SNORRI,There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
26623,L187588,u845,m54,HARALD,Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
26624,L187587,u853,m54,SNORRI,You're wasting your time.
26625,L187586,u845,m54,HARALD,I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
26626,L187585,u853,m54,SNORRI,You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
26627,L188403,u856,m54,THORFINN,Mum! Dad!
26628,L188402,u847,m54,IVAR,Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
26629,L188055,u856,m54,THORFINN,"Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!"
26630,L188054,u847,m54,IVAR,That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
26631,L188053,u856,m54,THORFINN,And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
26632,L188026,u847,m54,IVAR,That's it!
26633,L188025,u856,m54,THORFINN,Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
26634,L187690,u847,m54,IVAR,Bastard.
26635,L187689,u856,m54,THORFINN,He used to puke in his sleep.
26636,L187688,u847,m54,IVAR,Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
26637,L187687,u856,m54,THORFINN,Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
26638,L187686,u847,m54,IVAR,I know. I know.
26639,L187685,u856,m54,THORFINN,I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
26640,L187684,u847,m54,IVAR,How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
26641,L187683,u856,m54,THORFINN,"You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know."
26642,L187682,u847,m54,IVAR,"No, I'm not."
26643,L187681,u856,m54,THORFINN,Are you all right?
26644,L187784,u854,m54,SVEN,Hang on...
26645,L187783,u848,m54,KEITEL,For your own sake... For the others... I...
26646,L187782,u854,m54,SVEN,"I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too..."
26647,L187781,u848,m54,KEITEL,I'm not worth risking your life for.
26648,L187780,u854,m54,SVEN,What are you talking about?
26649,L187779,u848,m54,KEITEL,"Let me go, Sven."
26650,L187778,u854,m54,SVEN,Got you!
26651,L187777,u848,m54,KEITEL,Aaagh!
26652,L188164,u853,m54,SNORRI,What have you got there?
26653,L188163,u848,m54,KEITEL,"Get away, Snorri."
26654,L188162,u853,m54,SNORRI,"What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?"
26655,L188161,u848,m54,KEITEL,What?
26656,L188157,u853,m54,SNORRI,Oh...
26657,L188156,u848,m54,KEITEL,It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
26658,L188155,u853,m54,SNORRI,Who's that?
26659,L188096,u848,m54,KEITEL,I... I...
26660,L188095,u853,m54,SNORRI,Well! Come on!
26661,L188372,u848,m54,KEITEL,It's not my business any more!
26662,L188371,u851,m54,LOKI,"By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business..."
26663,L188370,u848,m54,KEITEL,"Made by YOU, Loki!"
26664,L188256,u848,m54,KEITEL,Like you got rid of Snorri!
26665,L188255,u851,m54,LOKI,I should have got rid of you long ago!
26666,L188254,u851,m54,LOKI,You fool!
26667,L188253,u848,m54,KEITEL,"We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!"
26668,L188252,u851,m54,LOKI,You've lost your mind.
26669,L188251,u848,m54,KEITEL,"No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!"
26670,L188250,u851,m54,LOKI,"Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!"
26671,L188249,u848,m54,KEITEL,She knows it was our fault!
26672,L188248,u851,m54,LOKI,Shut up!
26673,L188200,u851,m54,LOKI,Help!
26674,L188199,u848,m54,KEITEL,Help!
26675,L188198,u848,m54,KEITEL,You'll drown us bo...
26676,L188197,u851,m54,LOKI,Help!
26677,L188196,u848,m54,KEITEL,"Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!"
26678,L188194,u851,m54,LOKI,I'm drowning! Help!
26679,L188193,u848,m54,KEITEL,Relax!
26680,L188192,u851,m54,LOKI,I can't swim! I can't swim!
26681,L188149,u851,m54,LOKI,You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
26682,L188148,u848,m54,KEITEL,YOU do it!
26683,L188147,u851,m54,LOKI,Sh! Hurry!
26684,L188144,u848,m54,KEITEL,How can we stops him now?
26685,L188143,u851,m54,LOKI,Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
26686,L188120,u848,m54,KEITEL,Well... I... I thought...
26687,L188119,u851,m54,LOKI,"Wasn't it, Keitel?"
26688,L187549,u851,m54,LOKI,You can't let Erik do THAT.
26689,L187548,u848,m54,KEITEL,Together we stand!
26690,L187547,u851,m54,LOKI,Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
26691,L187546,u848,m54,KEITEL,The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
26692,L187545,u851,m54,LOKI,That's right.
26693,L187544,u848,m54,KEITEL,My brother blacksmiths!
26694,L187543,u851,m54,LOKI,"It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths."
26695,L187542,u848,m54,KEITEL,The bottom falls out of the sword business!
26696,L187541,u851,m54,LOKI,The Age of Ragnarok ends...
26697,L187540,u848,m54,KEITEL,They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
26698,L187539,u851,m54,LOKI,"But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods.."
26699,L187538,u848,m54,KEITEL,Can't make enough axe-heads!
26700,L187537,u848,m54,KEITEL,Can't make enough swords!
26701,L187536,u851,m54,LOKI,"If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us."
26702,L187535,u851,m54,LOKI,"Yes yes... of course.... the ""Blacksmith's Code""..."
26703,L187534,u848,m54,KEITEL,"Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says..."
26704,L187533,u851,m54,LOKI,You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
26705,L187532,u851,m54,LOKI,You could charge him what you like.
26706,L187531,u848,m54,KEITEL,"Yes, it is good. But I told him ten."
26707,L187530,u851,m54,LOKI,"Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one."
26708,L188367,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,I hate you! I hate you!
26709,L188366,u854,m54,SVEN,Dad!
26710,L188365,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,"And his ""you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper""..."
26711,L188364,u854,m54,SVEN,"Easy, Dad!"
26712,L188363,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,He drove me mad!
26713,L188274,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,Helpless...
26714,L188273,u854,m54,SVEN,There is nothing we can do...
26715,L188104,u854,m54,SVEN,"GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!"
26716,L188103,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,"Well, go on! Go berserk!"
26717,L188091,u854,m54,SVEN,"I'm just building up to it, Dad."
26718,L188090,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
26719,L187895,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,Sh!
26720,L187894,u854,m54,SVEN,"Well, of course he is!"
26721,L187758,u854,m54,SVEN,DEATH TO DRAGONS!
26722,L187757,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,HOLD it! HOLD it in!
26723,L187748,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,Stop it!
26724,L187747,u854,m54,SVEN,KILL! KILL!
26725,L187743,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
26726,L187742,u854,m54,SVEN,I must KILL! Kill!
26727,L187741,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,"Not now, Sven..."
26728,L187740,u854,m54,SVEN,We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
26729,L187573,u854,m54,SVEN,I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
26730,L187572,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
26731,L187571,u854,m54,SVEN,I must only let the red rage...
26732,L187570,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
26733,L187569,u854,m54,SVEN,But it's a responsibility...
26734,L187568,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,So did my father and his father before him.
26735,L187567,u854,m54,SVEN,So did your father...
26736,L187566,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
26737,L187565,u854,m54,SVEN,You went berserk...
26738,L187564,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
26739,L187563,u854,m54,SVEN,"I know, Dad."
26740,L187562,u855,m54,SVEN'S DAD,It's a tradition.
26741,L188112,u854,m54,SVEN,Tell him I'm coming!
26742,L188111,u856,m54,THORFINN,No... he's not... not... there...
26743,L188110,u854,m54,SVEN,You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
26744,L188109,u856,m54,THORFINN,I'm not frightened... of anything...
26745,L188108,u854,m54,SVEN,Thorfinn! You can't die!
26746,L187793,u856,m54,THORFINN,Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
26747,L187792,u854,m54,SVEN,Shut up.
26748,L187519,u856,m54,THORFINN,Me too.
26749,L187518,u854,m54,SVEN,Well... I'm game.
26750,L187513,u854,m54,SVEN,Neither am I.
26751,L187512,u856,m54,THORFINN,"Well I'M certainly not, either."
26752,L187481,u854,m54,SVEN,You liar!
26753,L187480,u856,m54,THORFINN,He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
26754,L187561,u856,m54,THORFINN,I never do...
26755,L187560,u857,m54,THORFINN'S MUM,"And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it."
26756,L187557,u856,m54,THORFINN,"Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad."
26757,L187556,u857,m54,THORFINN'S MUM,And keep your sword greased.
26758,L187555,u856,m54,THORFINN,"No, Mother."
26759,L187554,u857,m54,THORFINN'S MUM,And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
26760,L187553,u856,m54,THORFINN,"Yes, Mum."
26761,L187552,u857,m54,THORFINN'S MUM,And something to sharpen them with?
26762,L187551,u856,m54,THORFINN,"Yes, Mother."
26763,L187550,u857,m54,THORFINN'S MUM,And you've got BOTH axes?
26764,L194856,u861,m55,JOEL,No one.
26765,L194855,u858,m55,CARRIE,Who was the girl you walked off with?
26766,L194854,u858,m55,CARRIE,I told you that later.
26767,L194853,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah, you told me that later."
26768,L194852,u858,m55,CARRIE,"This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit."
26769,L194851,u861,m55,JOEL,I remember.
26770,L194850,u858,m55,CARRIE,"I did. You said, things were fine."
26771,L194849,u861,m55,JOEL,I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
26772,L194847,u861,m55,JOEL,"Just a little overworked, maybe."
26773,L194846,u858,m55,CARRIE,I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
26774,L194826,u858,m55,CARRIE,Say hi to Naomi.
26775,L194825,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah.
26776,L194824,u858,m55,CARRIE,"I hope you feel better, sweetie."
26777,L194823,u861,m55,JOEL,"Thanks, guys."
26778,L194403,u858,m55,CARRIE,"Sweetie, we called the company."
26779,L194402,u861,m55,JOEL,They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
26780,L194401,u858,m55,CARRIE,You weren't supposed to see that.
26781,L194398,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
26782,L194397,u858,m55,CARRIE,Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
26783,L194394,u861,m55,JOEL,She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
26784,L194393,u858,m55,CARRIE,"I don't know, honey. It's horrible."
26785,L194884,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?"
26786,L194883,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"No, it was lovely."
26787,L194873,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You did? You liked me?
26788,L194872,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,And I just liked you so much.
26789,L194871,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?"
26790,L194870,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it."
26791,L194425,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car..."
26792,L194424,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,Shit. The last time I saw you.
26793,L194079,u862,m55,MARY,Here we are.
26794,L194078,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Okay, I guess."
26795,L194077,u862,m55,MARY,How are you today?
26796,L194076,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Hi.
26797,L194075,u862,m55,MARY,Ms. Kruczynski?
26798,L194053,u862,m55,MARY,"Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you."
26799,L194052,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski."
26800,L194051,u862,m55,MARY,May I help you?
26801,L194637,u867,m55,PATRICK,Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
26802,L194636,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,What's wrong with me?
26803,L194574,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
26804,L194573,u867,m55,PATRICK,I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
26805,L194572,u867,m55,PATRICK,"I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing."
26806,L194571,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I'm so excited. Yay!
26807,L194555,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
26808,L194554,u867,m55,PATRICK,"Um, okay. I'll call my study partner."
26809,L194553,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
26810,L194552,u867,m55,PATRICK,Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
26811,L194551,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Come up to Boston with me?
26812,L194550,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
26813,L194549,u867,m55,PATRICK,"Oh, Tangerine."
26814,L194548,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
26815,L194547,u867,m55,PATRICK,"Oh, baby, what's going on?"
26816,L194334,u867,m55,PATRICK,In the world.
26817,L194333,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,In the room?
26818,L194332,u867,m55,PATRICK,It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
26819,L194329,u867,m55,PATRICK,"I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow."
26820,L194328,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You rat.
26821,L194327,u867,m55,PATRICK,"I can't. I want to, but I have to study."
26822,L194326,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Come over after I'm done here?
26823,L194325,u867,m55,PATRICK,I was not.
26824,L194324,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You were not.
26825,L194323,u867,m55,PATRICK,I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
26826,L194089,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
26827,L194088,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?"
26828,L194087,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
26829,L194086,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
26830,L194085,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess."
26831,L194083,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?"
26832,L194082,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Okay, I guess."
26833,L194081,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,How are you today?
26834,L195101,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
26835,L195100,u861,m55,JOEL,What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
26836,L195099,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
26837,L195098,u861,m55,JOEL,I can't stop thinking about you.
26838,L195097,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my ""gratuitous need to shock."""
26839,L195072,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
26840,L195071,u861,m55,JOEL,I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
26841,L195070,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?"
26842,L195069,u861,m55,JOEL,"Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake."
26843,L195068,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Doesn't sound like me.
26844,L195067,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't know.
26845,L195066,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Did I use the term ""sexual conquests"" or is that your way of putting it."
26846,L195065,u861,m55,JOEL,"Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests."
26847,L195064,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious."
26848,L195063,u861,m55,JOEL,"That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid."
26849,L195062,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,A bully? Moi?
26850,L195061,u861,m55,JOEL,Says you were a bully...
26851,L195060,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling."
26852,L195045,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
26853,L195044,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, you obviously don't know me."
26854,L195043,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
26855,L195042,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm nervous, too."
26856,L195041,u861,m55,JOEL,-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
26857,L195040,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Hey, Joel --"
26858,L195039,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
26859,L195038,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,That's okay. I --
26860,L195037,u861,m55,JOEL,Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
26861,L195036,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh, um..."
26862,L195035,u861,m55,JOEL,Have sex. Y'know --
26863,L195034,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Make love?
26864,L195033,u861,m55,JOEL,"Listen, did you want to make love?"
26865,L195032,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel, come here. Please."
26866,L195031,u861,m55,JOEL,I think I should go back.
26867,L195030,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,What if?
26868,L195029,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't know. What if it breaks?
26869,L195026,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't know.
26870,L195025,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
26871,L195000,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah.
26872,L194999,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
26873,L194998,u861,m55,JOEL,Tomorrow?
26874,L194997,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,When?
26875,L194996,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah.
26876,L194995,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"So you'll call me, right?"
26877,L194947,u861,m55,JOEL,I love you.
26878,L194946,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Bye, Joel."
26879,L194945,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
26880,L194944,u861,m55,JOEL,I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
26881,L194943,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,What if you stay this time?
26882,L194942,u861,m55,JOEL,"I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, ""so go"" with such disdain."
26883,L194941,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,So go.
26884,L194938,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment."
26885,L194937,u861,m55,JOEL,I think we should go.
26886,L194936,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet."
26887,L194935,u861,m55,JOEL,Naomi.
26888,L194934,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
26889,L194933,u861,m55,JOEL,It's dark.
26890,L194932,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
26891,L194931,u861,m55,JOEL,I knew.
26892,L194929,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I could see you wanted to come in, Joel."
26893,L194928,u861,m55,JOEL,I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
26894,L194927,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off."
26895,L194924,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,It's freezing out here.
26896,L194923,u861,m55,JOEL,What are you doing?
26897,L194922,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Cool.
26898,L194921,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
26899,L194920,u861,m55,JOEL,Female.
26900,L194919,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Male or female?
26901,L194918,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Oh.
26902,L194917,u861,m55,JOEL,I do sort of live with somebody though.
26903,L194916,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Let's move into this neighborhood.
26904,L194915,u861,m55,JOEL,"Um, no."
26905,L194914,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I wish we did. You married?
26906,L194913,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live."
26907,L194912,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah, yeah. It goes ""Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines""?"
26908,L194911,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Do you know her poem that starts ""Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live..."
26909,L194910,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah, maybe."
26910,L194909,u861,m55,JOEL,Seems too coincidental that way.
26911,L194908,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I think, before."
26912,L194907,u861,m55,JOEL,Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
26913,L194906,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Me too. There's this poem --
26914,L194905,u861,m55,JOEL,I think she's great.
26915,L194904,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store."
26916,L194903,u861,m55,JOEL,I love her.
26917,L194902,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
26918,L194901,u861,m55,JOEL,Okay.
26919,L194900,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
26920,L194899,u861,m55,JOEL,yeah?
26921,L194898,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance."
26922,L194897,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't think I've slept in a year.
26923,L194896,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,But my sleeping is really fucked up.
26924,L194895,u861,m55,JOEL,I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
26925,L194894,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated."
26926,L194891,u861,m55,JOEL,Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
26927,L194890,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,What do we do?
26928,L194889,u861,m55,JOEL,I know.
26929,L194888,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon."
26930,L194887,u861,m55,JOEL,Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
26931,L194886,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah, like that."
26932,L194885,u861,m55,JOEL,"You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?"
26933,L194882,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm Joel.
26934,L194881,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh God, how horrid."
26935,L194878,u861,m55,JOEL,And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
26936,L194877,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
26937,L194876,u861,m55,JOEL,You said --
26938,L194875,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah, I know. I'm fishing."
26939,L194874,u861,m55,JOEL,You know what I did.
26940,L194869,u861,m55,JOEL,Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
26941,L194868,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod."
26942,L194867,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
26943,L194866,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either."
26944,L194865,u861,m55,JOEL,You said...
26945,L194863,u861,m55,JOEL,Hi.
26946,L194862,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Hi there.
26947,L194822,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
26948,L194821,u861,m55,JOEL,"It would be different, if we could just give it another go around."
26949,L194820,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I know.
26950,L194819,u861,m55,JOEL,I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
26951,L194818,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Probably.
26952,L194817,u861,m55,JOEL,You had the whole human race pegged.
26953,L194816,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I had you pegged, didn't I?"
26954,L194815,u861,m55,JOEL,I remember that speech really well.
26955,L194814,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours."
26956,L194812,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
26957,L194811,u861,m55,JOEL,Okay.
26958,L194810,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me."
26959,L194809,u861,m55,JOEL,Not yet. Not married.
26960,L194808,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, you're married."
26961,L194807,u861,m55,JOEL,I'd like to... take you out or something.
26962,L194806,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Yeah?
26963,L194805,u861,m55,JOEL,Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
26964,L194804,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all."
26965,L194788,u861,m55,JOEL,I did it. I guess that means something.
26966,L194787,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Is that what you want?
26967,L194786,u861,m55,JOEL,I told her today I need to end it.
26968,L194768,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yes, exactly. Exactly my point."
26969,L194767,u861,m55,JOEL,It's very late.
26970,L194766,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Come up and see me... now.
26971,L194765,u861,m55,JOEL,I dropped you off after. You said --
26972,L194764,u861,m55,JOEL,And I didn't have an argument.
26973,L194763,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"So what. Infatuation is good, too."
26974,L194762,u861,m55,JOEL,I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
26975,L194761,u861,m55,JOEL,I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
26976,L194760,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,But you weren't. I could tell.
26977,L194759,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm sure, I said."
26978,L194758,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
26979,L194757,u861,m55,JOEL,We did talk about Naomi.
26980,L194756,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I'll buy that. Black's always good.
26981,L194755,u861,m55,JOEL,Right. Something black though.
26982,L194753,u861,m55,JOEL,"No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons."
26983,L194752,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Egad, were you horrified?"
26984,L194751,u861,m55,JOEL,"God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper."
26985,L194750,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,What was I wearing?
26986,L194749,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah.
26987,L194748,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Naomi, I guess."
26988,L194747,u861,m55,JOEL,Do you remember what we talked about?
26989,L194746,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"This is our first ""date"" date."
26990,L194745,u861,m55,JOEL,I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
26991,L194744,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Yeah.
26992,L194743,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working."
26993,L194688,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I love it!
26994,L194687,u861,m55,JOEL,I scoured the city for it.
26995,L194685,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!"
26996,L194684,u861,m55,JOEL,Happy Birthday.
26997,L194682,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --"
26998,L194681,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Joel!
26999,L194668,u861,m55,JOEL,"This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me."
27000,L194667,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?"
27001,L194663,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
27002,L194662,u861,m55,JOEL,They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
27003,L194661,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally."
27004,L194660,u861,m55,JOEL,Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
27005,L194659,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"But can't you see... I love you, Antoine."
27006,L194635,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now."
27007,L194634,u861,m55,JOEL,He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
27008,L194633,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Really? Is he cute?
27009,L194632,u861,m55,JOEL,"There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him."
27010,L194631,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,What?
27011,L194630,u861,m55,JOEL,There's this guy!
27012,L194629,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
27013,L194628,u861,m55,JOEL,"I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --"
27014,L194627,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You remember what happened next?
27015,L194626,u861,m55,JOEL,"I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties."
27016,L194625,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over."
27017,L194593,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden."
27018,L194592,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
27019,L194591,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I'm right here.
27020,L194590,u861,m55,JOEL,"I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem."
27021,L194586,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning."
27022,L194585,u861,m55,JOEL,What do you mean?
27023,L194584,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,What if you hide me?
27024,L194580,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't know.
27025,L194579,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?"
27026,L194578,u861,m55,JOEL,"I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore."
27027,L194577,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Oh?
27028,L194576,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!"
27029,L194575,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Such a beautiful view.
27030,L194539,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, ""It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."""
27031,L194538,u861,m55,JOEL,No.
27032,L194537,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
27033,L194536,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah, Tangerine?"
27034,L194535,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Joely...
27035,L194525,u861,m55,JOEL,No. Thanks.
27036,L194524,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,More?
27037,L194520,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel, you're a liar."
27038,L194519,u861,m55,JOEL,I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
27039,L194518,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I want to know you.
27040,L194517,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, it isn't that."
27041,L194516,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me."
27042,L194483,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --"
27043,L194482,u861,m55,JOEL,You're drunk.
27044,L194477,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Would you get me another, Joely?"
27045,L194476,u861,m55,JOEL,"So, um --"
27046,L194472,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!"
27047,L194471,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oh, thank God. It's going."
27048,L194470,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
27049,L194469,u861,m55,JOEL,"Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --"
27050,L194468,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
27051,L194467,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!"
27052,L194466,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't want to talk about this here.
27053,L194465,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,What?!
27054,L194464,u861,m55,JOEL,"Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?"
27055,L194463,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You're not ready.
27056,L194462,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't think we're ready.
27057,L194461,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
27058,L194460,u861,m55,JOEL,Let's talk about it later.
27059,L194459,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I want to have a baby.
27060,L194458,u861,m55,JOEL,Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
27061,L194457,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
27062,L194456,u861,m55,JOEL,Where are you going?
27063,L194455,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,How can you watch this crap?
27064,L194438,u861,m55,JOEL,Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
27065,L194437,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Fuck you, Joel. Faggot."
27066,L194436,u861,m55,JOEL,Let me drive you home.
27067,L194434,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?"
27068,L194433,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?"
27069,L194430,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
27070,L194429,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody."
27071,L194428,u861,m55,JOEL,Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
27072,L194427,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
27073,L194426,u861,m55,JOEL,I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
27074,L194423,u861,m55,JOEL,It's three.
27075,L194422,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Yo ho ho!
27076,L194331,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You didn't say anything about my hair.
27077,L194330,u861,m55,JOEL,How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
27078,L194299,u861,m55,JOEL,Okay.
27079,L194298,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
27080,L194297,u861,m55,JOEL,Tomorrow?
27081,L194296,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,When?
27082,L194295,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah.
27083,L194294,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You'll call me, right?"
27084,L194293,u861,m55,JOEL,"So, I enjoyed meeting you."
27085,L194291,u861,m55,JOEL,Yes.
27086,L194290,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
27087,L194289,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Okay.
27088,L194288,u861,m55,JOEL,"I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so..."
27089,L194287,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You should stay.
27090,L194286,u861,m55,JOEL,Sounds good. But right now I should go.
27091,L194285,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
27092,L194284,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah? Oh, great!"
27093,L194283,u861,m55,JOEL,Okay.
27094,L194282,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime."
27095,L194281,u861,m55,JOEL,I think so.
27096,L194280,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?"
27097,L194279,u861,m55,JOEL,That's scary sounding.
27098,L194278,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year."
27099,L194277,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oh, yeah."
27100,L194276,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph."
27101,L194275,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy..."
27102,L194274,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, not at all."
27103,L194273,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?"
27104,L194272,u861,m55,JOEL,No.
27105,L194271,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?"
27106,L194270,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah.
27107,L194269,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
27108,L194268,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
27109,L194267,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?"
27110,L194266,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah.
27111,L194265,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?"
27112,L194264,u861,m55,JOEL,Thanks.
27113,L194263,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy."
27114,L194262,u861,m55,JOEL,I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
27115,L194261,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot."
27116,L194260,u861,m55,JOEL,I think about that.
27117,L194259,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have."
27118,L194258,u861,m55,JOEL,Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
27119,L194257,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?"
27120,L194256,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,But I think I am. I like to think I am.
27121,L194255,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah, I guess."
27122,L194254,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?"
27123,L194253,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know."
27124,L194252,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?"
27125,L194251,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't know.
27126,L194250,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?"
27127,L194249,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah?
27128,L194248,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Y'know, I'm sort of psychic."
27129,L194246,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant."
27130,L194245,u861,m55,JOEL,Thanks.
27131,L194243,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I know a man who needs a refill.
27132,L194242,u861,m55,JOEL,No. I --
27133,L194241,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?"
27134,L194240,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, I should probably get going."
27135,L194237,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good."
27136,L194236,u861,m55,JOEL,You just say. I'm not really --
27137,L194235,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You pick it.
27138,L194234,u861,m55,JOEL,What do you want to hear?
27139,L194232,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, I'm okay for now."
27140,L194231,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Ready for another?
27141,L194230,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway."
27142,L194229,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm fine.
27143,L194228,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off."
27144,L194227,u861,m55,JOEL,Cheers.
27145,L194226,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!"
27146,L194225,u861,m55,JOEL,It's pretty.
27147,L194224,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?"
27148,L194223,u861,m55,JOEL,Frost?
27149,L194222,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued."
27150,L194221,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't know.
27151,L194220,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
27152,L194219,u861,m55,JOEL,"Thanks. That was good, that crow sound."
27153,L194218,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow."
27154,L194217,u861,m55,JOEL,Very much.
27155,L194216,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You like that?
27156,L194213,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel."
27157,L194212,u861,m55,JOEL,Um --
27158,L194211,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --"
27159,L194210,u861,m55,JOEL,Take care.
27160,L194209,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya."
27161,L194208,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, I wouldn't want to be --"
27162,L194207,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
27163,L194206,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm just a bit of a wreck. ""I sleep in your hat"" makes me cry.  Me."
27164,L194205,u861,m55,JOEL,What?
27165,L194204,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Remember? ""And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat...""  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry."
27166,L194203,u861,m55,JOEL,"Sort of, um..."
27167,L194202,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. ""Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen."" Remember?"
27168,L194201,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
27169,L194200,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way."
27170,L194199,u861,m55,JOEL,I like to read.
27171,L194198,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"So you like bookstores, huh?"
27172,L194197,u861,m55,JOEL,It's okay. I didn't think you were.
27173,L194196,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really."
27174,L194195,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Wilmont. Near the high school.
27175,L194194,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah.
27176,L194193,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You know Wilmont?
27177,L194192,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm not a stalker.
27178,L194191,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
27179,L194190,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no."
27180,L194189,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're not a stalker or anything, right?"
27181,L194188,u861,m55,JOEL,Where do you live?
27182,L194187,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Yeah?
27183,L194186,u861,m55,JOEL,It's okay.
27184,L194185,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I don't want to take you out of your way.
27185,L194184,u861,m55,JOEL,You're sure? It's cold.
27186,L194183,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No, that's okay. Thanks, though."
27187,L194182,u861,m55,JOEL,Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
27188,L194181,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
27189,L194180,u861,m55,JOEL,Probably see you at the book store.
27190,L194179,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then."
27191,L194178,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --"
27192,L194177,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, ""that's okay"" to me. That was nice of you."
27193,L194176,u861,m55,JOEL,That's okay.
27194,L194175,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today."
27195,L194174,u861,m55,JOEL,Yes?
27196,L194173,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel? It's Joel, right?"
27197,L194170,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
27198,L194169,u861,m55,JOEL,Okay.
27199,L194168,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
27200,L194163,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, anyway... Sorry."
27201,L194162,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
27202,L194161,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --"
27203,L194160,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Why wouldn't you think that about me?
27204,L194159,u861,m55,JOEL,"See, I wouldn't think that about you."
27205,L194158,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told."
27206,L194157,u861,m55,JOEL,"Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means ""merciful"", right?"
27207,L194156,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?"
27208,L194155,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm not nuts.
27209,L194154,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?"
27210,L194153,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't know what that means.
27211,L194152,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Huckleberry Hound?
27212,L194151,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't know any jokes about your name.
27213,L194150,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice."
27214,L194149,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm Joel.
27215,L194148,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"My name's Clementine, by the way."
27216,L194147,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah, I got it."
27217,L194146,u861,m55,JOEL,Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
27218,L194145,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?"
27219,L194144,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oh, I doubt that's the case."
27220,L194143,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?"
27221,L194142,u861,m55,JOEL,You sure? That doesn't sound --
27222,L194141,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
27223,L194140,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm sure you would.
27224,L194139,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it."
27225,L194138,u861,m55,JOEL,You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
27226,L194137,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Purple Haze, Pink Eraser."
27227,L194136,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't really know how --
27228,L194135,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole."
27229,L194134,u861,m55,JOEL,I can't remember.
27230,L194133,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
27231,L194132,u861,m55,JOEL,Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
27232,L194131,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
27233,L194130,u861,m55,JOEL,I like it.
27234,L194129,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?"
27235,L194128,u861,m55,JOEL,"I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you."
27236,L194127,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
27237,L194126,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't have one.
27238,L194125,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead."
27239,L194124,u861,m55,JOEL,-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
27240,L194123,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now."
27241,L194122,u861,m55,JOEL,Really? Because --
27242,L194121,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now."
27243,L194120,u861,m55,JOEL,"The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?"
27244,L194119,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
27245,L194118,u861,m55,JOEL,Rockville Center.
27246,L194117,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course."
27247,L194116,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's okay, really."
27248,L194115,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --"
27249,L194114,u861,m55,JOEL,"I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --"
27250,L194113,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Oh. So...
27251,L194112,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably."
27252,L194111,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something."
27253,L194110,u861,m55,JOEL,Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
27254,L194109,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car."
27255,L194108,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, I didn't want to assume."
27256,L194107,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Really?
27257,L194106,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so..."
27258,L194105,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
27259,L194104,u861,m55,JOEL,Why what?
27260,L194103,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,Why?
27261,L194102,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm sorry.
27262,L195096,u861,m55,JOEL,Jesus.
27263,L195095,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,Your dried cum.
27264,L195094,u861,m55,JOEL,I don't know. Panties and --
27265,L195093,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,Guess what I'm wearing.
27266,L195092,u861,m55,JOEL,You must have been crazy.
27267,L195091,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,"God, I can't believe I ever hated you."
27268,L195090,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you."
27269,L195089,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,"Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?"
27270,L195088,u861,m55,JOEL,"Hi, it's Joel."
27271,L195058,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,"Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?"
27272,L195057,u861,m55,JOEL,"Look, I have to go. I have to think."
27273,L195056,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
27274,L195055,u861,m55,JOEL,It's true.
27275,L195052,u861,m55,JOEL,That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
27276,L195051,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
27277,L195050,u861,m55,JOEL,"I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?"
27278,L195049,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,I probably got the same thing as you.
27279,L195048,u861,m55,JOEL,Did you send this? Is it a joke?
27280,L195047,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,Yeah?
27281,L195024,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
27282,L195023,u861,m55,JOEL,I guess so.
27283,L195022,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,"Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married."
27284,L195021,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oddly enough, I do."
27285,L195020,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,Hmmm. Do you miss me?
27286,L195019,u861,m55,JOEL,I just walked in.
27287,L195018,u860,m55,CLEMENTINE'S VOICE,What took you so long?
27288,L195012,u861,m55,JOEL,"There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had..."
27289,L195011,u865,m55,NAOMI'S VOICE,That's me.
27290,L195008,u865,m55,NAOMI'S VOICE,Long day thinking.
27291,L195007,u861,m55,JOEL,I just got in.
27292,L195006,u865,m55,NAOMI'S VOICE,"Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?"
27293,L195005,u861,m55,JOEL,I know. I had to take the day to think.
27294,L195004,u865,m55,NAOMI'S VOICE,Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
27295,L195003,u861,m55,JOEL,How's it going?
27296,L195002,u865,m55,NAOMI'S VOICE,Hi.
27297,L195001,u861,m55,JOEL,"Hi, Naomi, it's Joel."
27298,L194940,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs."
27299,L194939,u861,m55,JOEL,I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
27300,L194926,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
27301,L194925,u861,m55,JOEL,Clementine.
27302,L194893,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
27303,L194892,u861,m55,JOEL,So you're still on the Zoloft?
27304,L194861,u861,m55,JOEL,"But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye."
27305,L194860,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean."
27306,L194859,u861,m55,JOEL,"Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt."
27307,L194841,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over."
27308,L194840,u861,m55,JOEL,Okay. I wish you could come.
27309,L194779,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying."
27310,L194778,u861,m55,JOEL,Naomi.
27311,L194691,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
27312,L194690,u861,m55,JOEL,I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
27313,L194583,u861,m55,JOEL,I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
27314,L194582,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,She's so sexy.
27315,L194522,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
27316,L194521,u861,m55,JOEL,How's the chicken?
27317,L194432,u861,m55,JOEL,And what are you like? A wino?
27318,L194431,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said..."
27319,L194382,u861,m55,JOEL,"Any messages, Carmen?"
27320,L194381,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
27321,L194380,u861,m55,JOEL,So then she just stops calling.
27322,L194337,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!"
27323,L194336,u861,m55,JOEL,Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
27324,L194322,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,That's your look for me.
27325,L194321,u861,m55,JOEL,Clementine.
27326,L194320,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and..."
27327,L194319,u861,m55,JOEL,"I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and..."
27328,L194318,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
27329,L194317,u861,m55,JOEL,I should maybe talk to you.
27330,L194315,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,It's too late.
27331,L194314,u861,m55,JOEL,It's them.
27332,L194310,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice."
27333,L194309,u861,m55,JOEL,Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
27334,L194308,u861,m55,JOEL,"Fuck you, Clementine."
27335,L194307,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,"Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her."
27336,L194306,u861,m55,JOEL,I might be making a mistake.
27337,L194304,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,I'm like a joke to them.
27338,L194303,u861,m55,JOEL,"The driver waved. So casual, friendly."
27339,L194302,u871,m55,VOICE-OVER,There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
27340,L194301,u861,m55,JOEL,It was snowing.
27341,L194569,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too."
27342,L194568,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
27343,L194567,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,What? What do you mean?
27344,L194566,u861,m55,JOEL,You have to stop this!
27345,L194565,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
27346,L194372,u861,m55,JOEL,It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
27347,L194371,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
27348,L194370,u861,m55,JOEL,Well... I did.
27349,L194369,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
27350,L194346,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss."
27351,L194345,u861,m55,JOEL,Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
27352,L194344,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking."
27353,L195017,u864,m55,NAOMI,'Night.
27354,L195016,u861,m55,JOEL,We'll speak soon.
27355,L195015,u864,m55,NAOMI,So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
27356,L195014,u861,m55,JOEL,I had a good time last night. I really did.
27357,L195013,u864,m55,NAOMI,"Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right."
27358,L194994,u864,m55,NAOMI,I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
27359,L194993,u861,m55,JOEL,So you think the dissertation will get published?
27360,L194992,u864,m55,NAOMI,I'm glad you called.
27361,L194991,u861,m55,JOEL,I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
27362,L194990,u864,m55,NAOMI,A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
27363,L194989,u861,m55,JOEL,Oh! Great. That's great!
27364,L194988,u864,m55,NAOMI,"Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while."
27365,L194987,u861,m55,JOEL,I miss you.
27366,L194986,u864,m55,NAOMI,"Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --"
27367,L194985,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry."
27368,L194984,u864,m55,NAOMI,I'm sorry.
27369,L194983,u861,m55,JOEL,It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
27370,L194982,u864,m55,NAOMI,So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
27371,L194845,u864,m55,NAOMI,Yeah.
27372,L194844,u861,m55,JOEL,I hope you get your work done.
27373,L194843,u864,m55,NAOMI,Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
27374,L194839,u864,m55,NAOMI,I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
27375,L194838,u861,m55,JOEL,So you don't mind?
27376,L194836,u861,m55,JOEL,In a minute.
27377,L194835,u864,m55,NAOMI,Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
27378,L194834,u861,m55,JOEL,Go back to sleep.
27379,L194833,u864,m55,NAOMI,"Hi, Rob and Carrie."
27380,L194832,u861,m55,JOEL,You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
27381,L194831,u864,m55,NAOMI,How was it?
27382,L194830,u861,m55,JOEL,Hi.
27383,L194829,u864,m55,NAOMI,Hi.
27384,L194798,u861,m55,JOEL,It's not somebody else.
27385,L194797,u864,m55,NAOMI,"The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems."
27386,L194796,u861,m55,JOEL,"No. I just need some space, maybe."
27387,L194795,u864,m55,NAOMI,Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
27388,L194794,u861,m55,JOEL,"I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition."
27389,L194793,u864,m55,NAOMI,"Don't say ""we"" when you mean ""you."""
27390,L194792,u861,m55,JOEL,"Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --"
27391,L194791,u864,m55,NAOMI,What?
27392,L194790,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other."
27393,L194789,u864,m55,NAOMI,"So what's going on, Joel?"
27394,L194785,u864,m55,NAOMI,"Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really."
27395,L194784,u861,m55,JOEL,"Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch."
27396,L194783,u861,m55,JOEL,You take it. I don't know.
27397,L194782,u864,m55,NAOMI,Yours?
27398,L194514,u862,m55,MARY,I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
27399,L194513,u867,m55,PATRICK,Definitely!
27400,L194509,u862,m55,MARY,"I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things."
27401,L194508,u867,m55,PATRICK,Very cool. Trippy.
27402,L194507,u862,m55,MARY,"""The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."""
27403,L194506,u867,m55,PATRICK,Yeah. Cool.
27404,L194505,u862,m55,MARY,I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
27405,L194497,u867,m55,PATRICK,"Nah, I don't know."
27406,L194496,u862,m55,MARY,"Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?"
27407,L194485,u867,m55,PATRICK,"Hi, Mary. How's it going?"
27408,L194484,u862,m55,MARY,"Oh, hey, Patrick."
27409,L195116,u869,m55,STAN,Mary... please. This is hurting people.
27410,L195115,u862,m55,MARY,Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
27411,L195114,u869,m55,STAN,The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
27412,L195113,u862,m55,MARY,I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
27413,L195112,u869,m55,STAN,"Mary, people come to him voluntarily."
27414,L195111,u862,m55,MARY,They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
27415,L195110,u869,m55,STAN,I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
27416,L195109,u862,m55,MARY,Then why did you ask me?
27417,L195108,u869,m55,STAN,I know what it is.
27418,L195107,u862,m55,MARY,Nothing.
27419,L195106,u869,m55,STAN,What's this?
27420,L195105,u869,m55,STAN,Can I... I brought some --
27421,L195104,u862,m55,MARY,"What do you want, Stan?"
27422,L195103,u869,m55,STAN,Hi.
27423,L195102,u862,m55,MARY,Oh.
27424,L194970,u862,m55,MARY,"Thanks, Stan."
27425,L194969,u869,m55,STAN,"You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love."
27426,L194968,u862,m55,MARY,Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
27427,L194967,u869,m55,STAN,"I really like you, Mary. You know that."
27428,L194966,u869,m55,STAN,I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
27429,L194965,u862,m55,MARY,And after that?
27430,L194964,u869,m55,STAN,Happy. Happy with a secret.
27431,L194963,u862,m55,MARY,How did I look?
27432,L194962,u869,m55,STAN,It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
27433,L194961,u869,m55,STAN,"Once, maybe."
27434,L194960,u862,m55,MARY,And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
27435,L194959,u869,m55,STAN,I swear.
27436,L194958,u862,m55,MARY,Do you swear you didn't know?
27437,L194957,u869,m55,STAN,Hey.
27438,L194620,u862,m55,MARY,Hell no.
27439,L194619,u869,m55,STAN,You better go.
27440,L194618,u862,m55,MARY,He's coming?
27441,L194607,u862,m55,MARY,"This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan."
27442,L194606,u869,m55,STAN,No way. I can handle this.
27443,L194604,u869,m55,STAN,Shit!
27444,L194603,u862,m55,MARY,Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
27445,L194602,u869,m55,STAN,I don't know! I just said that!
27446,L194601,u862,m55,MARY,"Well, what should we do?"
27447,L194600,u869,m55,STAN,I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
27448,L194599,u869,m55,STAN,I don't know. He's not on the map.
27449,L194598,u862,m55,MARY,Where?
27450,L194597,u869,m55,STAN,It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
27451,L194596,u869,m55,STAN,"Listen, it's not erasing."
27452,L194595,u862,m55,MARY,What?
27453,L194594,u869,m55,STAN,It's stopped.
27454,L194545,u869,m55,STAN,"You love him, don't you?"
27455,L194544,u862,m55,MARY,"To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away."
27456,L194543,u869,m55,STAN,Yeah.
27457,L194542,u862,m55,MARY,"It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world."
27458,L194533,u869,m55,STAN,Go.
27459,L194532,u862,m55,MARY,"Let him go, Stan. I can help."
27460,L194512,u869,m55,STAN,Yup.
27461,L194511,u862,m55,MARY,Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
27462,L194510,u869,m55,STAN,Yup.
27463,L194502,u869,m55,STAN,It's a good one all right.
27464,L194501,u862,m55,MARY,"Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate."
27465,L194500,u869,m55,STAN,That's a good one.
27466,L194499,u862,m55,MARY,Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
27467,L194491,u862,m55,MARY,"Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something."
27468,L194490,u869,m55,STAN,We haven't checked.
27469,L194489,u862,m55,MARY,Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
27470,L194488,u869,m55,STAN,You found us okay?
27471,L194487,u862,m55,MARY,It's freezing out.
27472,L194074,u862,m55,MARY,"I better do this, Stan."
27473,L194073,u869,m55,STAN,"Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --"
27474,L194072,u862,m55,MARY,'kay.
27475,L194071,u869,m55,STAN,"See you later, alligator."
27476,L194070,u862,m55,MARY,"Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here."
27477,L194069,u869,m55,STAN,I know. Anyway --
27478,L194068,u862,m55,MARY,It's just... y'know... I mean...
27479,L194067,u869,m55,STAN,Sorry. I just --
27480,L194066,u862,m55,MARY,Stan... c'mon...
27481,L194064,u862,m55,MARY,Hi.
27482,L194063,u869,m55,STAN,Boo.
27483,L194981,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility."
27484,L194980,u862,m55,MARY,You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
27485,L194979,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,It was a mutual decision.
27486,L194978,u862,m55,MARY,You made me have an abortion.
27487,L194977,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"I have a family, Mary."
27488,L194976,u862,m55,MARY,"Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say ""naked"" to you!"
27489,L194975,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here."
27490,L194974,u862,m55,MARY,Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
27491,L194734,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
27492,L194733,u862,m55,MARY,"What, Howard?"
27493,L194722,u862,m55,MARY,"No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard."
27494,L194721,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,We can't do this.
27495,L194720,u862,m55,MARY,I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
27496,L194719,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that."
27497,L194718,u862,m55,MARY,I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
27498,L194716,u862,m55,MARY,"Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?"
27499,L194715,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it."
27500,L194714,u862,m55,MARY,Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
27501,L194713,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,That's lovely.
27502,L194711,u862,m55,MARY,You are such a sweetheart.
27503,L194710,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,It's no big deal.
27504,L194709,u862,m55,MARY,"Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out."
27505,L194708,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,Alexander Pope?
27506,L194707,u862,m55,MARY,"There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander."
27507,L194706,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it."
27508,L194705,u862,m55,MARY,"Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know."
27509,L194704,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,Is that Nietzsche?
27510,L194703,u862,m55,MARY,"Okay, um, there's one that goes ""Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."""
27511,L194702,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some."
27512,L194701,u862,m55,MARY,"Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too."
27513,L194700,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,How do you mean?
27514,L194699,u862,m55,MARY,"Do you like quotes, Howard?"
27515,L194656,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Well, thank you, Mary."
27516,L194655,u862,m55,MARY,"That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist."
27517,L194654,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Okay, we're back in."
27518,L194062,u862,m55,MARY,"Welcome, Howard."
27519,L194061,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,Thanks.
27520,L194060,u862,m55,MARY,"Cole slaw, ice tea?"
27521,L194059,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,Order me a pastrami for after?
27522,L194058,u862,m55,MARY,Yes?
27523,L194057,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,Mary...
27524,L194056,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in."
27525,L194055,u862,m55,MARY,"Howard, your one o'clock."
27526,L194617,u870,m55,STAN'S VOICE,"1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center."
27527,L194616,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Jesus. All right, what's the address."
27528,L194615,u870,m55,STAN'S VOICE,He went home sick.
27529,L194614,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Well, where was Patrick?"
27530,L194613,u870,m55,STAN'S VOICE,I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
27531,L194612,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?"
27532,L194611,u870,m55,STAN'S VOICE,The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
27533,L194610,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,Stan? What's going on?
27534,L195082,u869,m55,STAN,Jesus.
27535,L195081,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
27536,L195080,u869,m55,STAN,"I don't know what you're talking about, Howard."
27537,L195079,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --"
27538,L194953,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Thanks, Stan. Thanks."
27539,L194952,u869,m55,STAN,"So, I've got to drop the van off."
27540,L194698,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"That's fine, Stan."
27541,L194697,u869,m55,STAN,I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
27542,L194665,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,Oh dear.
27543,L194664,u869,m55,STAN,"Howard, they've disappeared again."
27544,L194658,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Yeah, probably a good idea."
27545,L194657,u869,m55,STAN,"You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here."
27546,L194648,u869,m55,STAN,Yeah. Of course.
27547,L194647,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,Did you try going through C-Gate?
27548,L194646,u869,m55,STAN,I tried that already.
27549,L194642,u869,m55,STAN,"She came to help, Howard."
27550,L194641,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,Mary. What are you doing here?
27551,L194361,u869,m55,STAN,"December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long."
27552,L194360,u863,m55,MIERZWIAK,"Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable."
27553,L194050,u868,m55,RECEPTIONIST,Maybe after the holidays then.
27554,L194049,u866,m55,OLD WOMAN,This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
27555,L194047,u868,m55,RECEPTIONIST,Of course. Please have a seat.
27556,L194046,u866,m55,OLD WOMAN,Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
27557,L194045,u868,m55,RECEPTIONIST,I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
27558,L194044,u866,m55,OLD WOMAN,"Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --"
27559,L194043,u868,m55,RECEPTIONIST,"Oh, hi."
27560,L194561,u867,m55,PATRICK,"Thanks, Stan. I owe you."
27561,L194560,u869,m55,STAN,I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
27562,L194531,u867,m55,PATRICK,She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
27563,L194530,u869,m55,STAN,"Patrick, we're in the middle of --"
27564,L194529,u867,m55,PATRICK,"Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --"
27565,L194504,u869,m55,STAN,It's a quote book.
27566,L194503,u867,m55,PATRICK,What's your bartlett's?
27567,L194494,u867,m55,PATRICK,"Okay, There's more, Stan --"
27568,L194493,u869,m55,STAN,Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
27569,L194492,u867,m55,PATRICK,Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
27570,L194445,u869,m55,STAN,"Jesus, Patrick!"
27571,L194444,u867,m55,PATRICK,"She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what."
27572,L194443,u869,m55,STAN,"She was unconscious, Patrick."
27573,L194442,u867,m55,PATRICK,I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
27574,L194421,u869,m55,STAN,"Patrick, we need to focus."
27575,L194420,u867,m55,PATRICK,The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
27576,L194419,u869,m55,STAN,This one's history. Moving on...
27577,L194418,u867,m55,PATRICK,Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
27578,L194417,u869,m55,STAN,You can if you want.
27579,L194416,u867,m55,PATRICK,"I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now."
27580,L194415,u869,m55,STAN,She likes you okay.
27581,L194414,u867,m55,PATRICK,I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
27582,L194413,u869,m55,STAN,Just wanted to let you know.
27583,L194412,u867,m55,PATRICK,Yeah?
27584,L194377,u867,m55,PATRICK,Yeah.
27585,L194376,u869,m55,STAN,"Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us."
27586,L194375,u867,m55,PATRICK,"Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy."
27587,L194374,u869,m55,STAN,It's an apartment.
27588,L194359,u869,m55,STAN,"Yeah, that looks better. Thanks."
27589,L194358,u867,m55,PATRICK,Does that help?
27590,L194357,u869,m55,STAN,Then check the connections.
27591,L194356,u867,m55,PATRICK,The voltage looks fine.
27592,L195536,u872,m56,CHINK,That's your problem.
27593,L195535,u877,m56,SISSY,How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
27594,L195534,u872,m56,CHINK,"Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve."
27595,L195533,u872,m56,CHINK,"The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave."
27596,L195532,u877,m56,SISSY,"Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard."
27597,L195529,u872,m56,CHINK,"Easy come, easy go."
27598,L195528,u877,m56,SISSY,But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
27599,L195527,u872,m56,CHINK,You mean she's dead?
27600,L195526,u877,m56,SISSY,She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
27601,L195525,u872,m56,CHINK,I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
27602,L195524,u877,m56,SISSY,"The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!"
27603,L195523,u872,m56,CHINK,"Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better."
27604,L195522,u877,m56,SISSY,Is everything getting worse?
27605,L195433,u872,m56,CHINK,Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
27606,L195432,u877,m56,SISSY,What do you believe in then?
27607,L195428,u872,m56,CHINK,"The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled ""Indians"" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that ""Indians"" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906."
27608,L195427,u877,m56,SISSY,"Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?"
27609,L195426,u872,m56,CHINK,"During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains."
27610,L195425,u877,m56,SISSY,The Clock People?
27611,L195424,u872,m56,CHINK,"But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee."
27612,L195423,u872,m56,CHINK,"He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own."
27613,L195422,u877,m56,SISSY,"Siwash, huh?"
27614,L195421,u872,m56,CHINK,The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
27615,L195420,u877,m56,SISSY,Clockworks?
27616,L195419,u872,m56,CHINK,Clockworks.
27617,L195418,u877,m56,SISSY,What was that?
27618,L195416,u872,m56,CHINK,Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
27619,L195415,u877,m56,SISSY,But I don't know how to polka.
27620,L195412,u872,m56,CHINK,Save your breath for the climb.
27621,L195411,u877,m56,SISSY,"Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help..."
27622,L195410,u872,m56,CHINK,I know who you are.
27623,L195409,u877,m56,SISSY,I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
27624,L195277,u873,m56,HOWARD,"Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home."
27625,L195276,u877,m56,SISSY,Where are the others?
27626,L195265,u877,m56,SISSY,"You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling."
27627,L195264,u873,m56,HOWARD,"A traveler, eh?"
27628,L195263,u877,m56,SISSY,"Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving."
27629,L195262,u873,m56,HOWARD,You don't?
27630,L195261,u877,m56,SISSY,I don't.
27631,L195260,u873,m56,HOWARD,"I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?"
27632,L195259,u877,m56,SISSY,I'm staying with the Countess.
27633,L195258,u873,m56,HOWARD,"Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?"
27634,L195496,u877,m56,SISSY,"If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts...."
27635,L195495,u874,m56,JELLY,"Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem."
27636,L195489,u877,m56,SISSY,But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
27637,L195488,u874,m56,JELLY,'Drugged' is a stupid word.
27638,L195487,u877,m56,SISSY,"No, I guess not."
27639,L195481,u877,m56,SISSY,"How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?"
27640,L195480,u874,m56,JELLY,"Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised."
27641,L195479,u877,m56,SISSY,"So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?"
27642,L195478,u874,m56,JELLY,Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
27643,L195467,u874,m56,JELLY,"FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT."
27644,L195466,u877,m56,SISSY,That's Jellybean!
27645,L195388,u874,m56,JELLY,"I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet."
27646,L195387,u877,m56,SISSY,"You don't agree with Debbie, then?"
27647,L195386,u874,m56,JELLY,"Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear."
27648,L195385,u877,m56,SISSY,What is Debbie's position?
27649,L195384,u874,m56,JELLY,"......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetkame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag."
27650,L195372,u874,m56,JELLY,"Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy."
27651,L195371,u877,m56,SISSY,"Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?"
27652,L195370,u874,m56,JELLY,Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
27653,L195369,u874,m56,JELLY,"No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. ""Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."""
27654,L195368,u877,m56,SISSY,"You're political, then?"
27655,L195367,u874,m56,JELLY,"Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'"
27656,L195366,u877,m56,SISSY,About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
27657,L195365,u874,m56,JELLY,About...
27658,L195364,u877,m56,SISSY,Tell me about it.
27659,L195363,u874,m56,JELLY,"Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichs and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl."
27660,L195362,u877,m56,SISSY,"No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone."
27661,L195361,u874,m56,JELLY,"Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend..."
27662,L195360,u877,m56,SISSY,"Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast."
27663,L195359,u874,m56,JELLY,"Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do."
27664,L195322,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road."
27665,L195321,u875,m56,JULIAN,What guy?
27666,L195320,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake."
27667,L195319,u875,m56,JULIAN,"If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'"
27668,L195318,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie."
27669,L195317,u875,m56,JULIAN,"I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault."
27670,L195316,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,Whose fault was that?
27671,L195315,u875,m56,JULIAN,"Oh, we didn't get it all the way on."
27672,L195314,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?"
27673,L195313,u875,m56,JULIAN,Well.... er...
27674,L195312,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,What do you think?
27675,L195311,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,Like what?
27676,L195310,u875,m56,JULIAN,How does she like what in bed?
27677,L195309,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?"
27678,L195308,u875,m56,JULIAN,"I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town."
27679,L195307,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?"
27680,L195306,u875,m56,JULIAN,Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
27681,L195305,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language."
27682,L195304,u875,m56,JULIAN,"Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate."
27683,L195303,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?"
27684,L195302,u875,m56,JULIAN,Extraordinary!
27685,L195299,u877,m56,SISSY,"My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore."
27686,L195298,u875,m56,JULIAN,Why? Why do you have to go?
27687,L195297,u877,m56,SISSY,"I have to go, Julian."
27688,L195296,u875,m56,JULIAN,But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
27689,L195295,u877,m56,SISSY,Getting dressed. I've got to go.
27690,L195294,u875,m56,JULIAN,What are you doing?
27691,L195293,u877,m56,SISSY,It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
27692,L195292,u875,m56,JULIAN,Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
27693,L195291,u877,m56,SISSY,I'm cold.
27694,L195196,u877,m56,SISSY,"As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace."
27695,L195195,u876,m56,MAN,Whooee!
27696,L195194,u877,m56,SISSY,"When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways."
27697,L195193,u876,m56,MAN,You're the best?
27698,L195192,u877,m56,SISSY,I'm the best.
27699,L195191,u876,m56,MAN,Hitchhiking?
27700,L195190,u877,m56,SISSY,Yep.
27701,L195189,u876,m56,MAN,So now you're bummin' around?
27702,L195188,u877,m56,SISSY,"I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off."
27703,L195187,u876,m56,MAN,For magazines?
27704,L195186,u877,m56,SISSY,I was a successful model once.
27705,L195185,u876,m56,MAN,Are you in show business?
27706,L195184,u877,m56,SISSY,American Cheese. The king of road food.
27707,L195183,u876,m56,MAN,Thanks.
27708,L195182,u876,m56,MAN,You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
27709,L195181,u877,m56,SISSY,Going north?
27710,L195437,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer..."
27711,L195436,u877,m56,SISSY,I don't know anything about it.
27712,L195435,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?"
27713,L195233,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman."
27714,L195232,u877,m56,SISSY,"Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However..."
27715,L195231,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
27716,L195230,u877,m56,SISSY,What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
27717,L195229,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all."
27718,L195228,u877,m56,SISSY,"Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think..."
27719,L195227,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?"
27720,L195226,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender."
27721,L195225,u877,m56,SISSY,But Countess...
27722,L195224,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
27723,L195223,u877,m56,SISSY,"If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?"
27724,L195222,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist."
27725,L195221,u877,m56,SISSY,"The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings."
27726,L195220,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me."
27727,L195219,u877,m56,SISSY,A job for me?
27728,L195218,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job..."
27729,L195217,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually."
27730,L195216,u877,m56,SISSY,Your ranch?
27731,L195215,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same."
27732,L195214,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
27733,L195213,u877,m56,SISSY,Bonanza Jellybean?
27734,L195212,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink."
27735,L195211,u877,m56,SISSY,Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
27736,L195210,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever."
27737,L195209,u877,m56,SISSY,"I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be."
27738,L195208,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean."
27739,L195207,u877,m56,SISSY,A born freak can only go uphill.
27740,L195206,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling."
27741,L195205,u877,m56,SISSY,Tired...
27742,L195204,u878,m56,THE COUNTESS,"To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?"
27743,L195847,u882,m57,JUSTIN,I think I found something...
27744,L195846,u879,m57,COOPER,Justin?
27745,L195845,u882,m57,JUSTIN,Holy shit...
27746,L195842,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing."
27747,L195841,u879,m57,COOPER,Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
27748,L195840,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here."
27749,L195839,u879,m57,COOPER,...do you copy?
27750,L195767,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man."
27751,L195766,u879,m57,COOPER,You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
27752,L195674,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?"
27753,L195673,u879,m57,COOPER,I can see why they sent you along.
27754,L195651,u879,m57,COOPER,I heard it.
27755,L195650,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"That means top-secret, Cooper."
27756,L195645,u879,m57,COOPER,I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
27757,L195644,u882,m57,JUSTIN,Ballast.
27758,L196373,u884,m57,MILLER,It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
27759,L196372,u879,m57,COOPER,Will it work?
27760,L196371,u884,m57,MILLER,You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
27761,L196370,u879,m57,COOPER,...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
27762,L196239,u884,m57,MILLER,On my way.
27763,L196238,u879,m57,COOPER,"Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark."
27764,L196127,u884,m57,MILLER,I'll get him.
27765,L196126,u879,m57,COOPER,But Justin...
27766,L195894,u884,m57,MILLER,"Hold on, Coop..."
27767,L195893,u879,m57,COOPER,"The containment, Second Containment..."
27768,L195892,u884,m57,MILLER,"Coop, where are you..."
27769,L195891,u879,m57,COOPER,We have a man down...
27770,L195764,u879,m57,COOPER,I'll be all over it.
27771,L195763,u884,m57,MILLER,"You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens..."
27772,L195762,u879,m57,COOPER,"...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on..."
27773,L195693,u884,m57,MILLER,You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
27774,L195692,u879,m57,COOPER,From what?
27775,L195658,u884,m57,MILLER,EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
27776,L195657,u879,m57,COOPER,...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
27777,L195643,u884,m57,MILLER,"This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?"
27778,L195642,u879,m57,COOPER,"You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that..."
27779,L195641,u884,m57,MILLER,"Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --"
27780,L195588,u884,m57,MILLER,"Don't start with me, Cooper."
27781,L195587,u879,m57,COOPER,Time to play Spam in the can.
27782,L196302,u886,m57,SMITH,Roger that.
27783,L196301,u879,m57,COOPER,"Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in."
27784,L196300,u879,m57,COOPER,"Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith..."
27785,L196243,u879,m57,COOPER,"We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole."
27786,L196242,u886,m57,SMITH,It's holding... She's holding...!
27787,L196119,u886,m57,SMITH,What about the accumulator...?
27788,L196118,u879,m57,COOPER,We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
27789,L195991,u879,m57,COOPER,You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
27790,L195990,u886,m57,SMITH,"You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down."
27791,L195989,u879,m57,COOPER,"Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me."
27792,L195988,u886,m57,SMITH,"You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel."
27793,L195987,u879,m57,COOPER,What?
27794,L195986,u886,m57,SMITH,I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
27795,L195985,u879,m57,COOPER,You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
27796,L195964,u879,m57,COOPER,"I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking ""optical effect!"""
27797,L195963,u888,m57,WEIR,What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
27798,L195962,u879,m57,COOPER,"I'm telling you, I saw it..."
27799,L195961,u888,m57,WEIR,I don't know what happened to Justin.
27800,L195958,u888,m57,WEIR,"Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible..."
27801,L195957,u879,m57,COOPER,You weren't there. I saw it.
27802,L195956,u888,m57,WEIR,"No, he didn't."
27803,L195955,u879,m57,COOPER,It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
27804,L195695,u879,m57,COOPER,"Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?"
27805,L195694,u888,m57,WEIR,"The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now."
27806,L195630,u888,m57,WEIR,"No, thank you."
27807,L195629,u879,m57,COOPER,Coffee.
27808,L195628,u888,m57,WEIR,What?
27809,L195627,u879,m57,COOPER,"Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?"
27810,L196384,u887,m57,STARCK,Run!
27811,L196383,u879,m57,COOPER,What...?
27812,L196379,u887,m57,STARCK,Hurry.
27813,L196378,u879,m57,COOPER,I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
27814,L196366,u879,m57,COOPER,I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
27815,L196365,u887,m57,STARCK,"I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert..."
27816,L196364,u879,m57,COOPER,Can you shut it down?
27817,L196363,u887,m57,STARCK,There must be a way! What about Engineering?
27818,L196362,u879,m57,COOPER,How? The Bridge is gone.
27819,L196358,u887,m57,STARCK,"You're okay now, it's over..."
27820,L196357,u879,m57,COOPER,"Let me breathe, let me breathe..."
27821,L195867,u887,m57,STARCK,"I don't know, the screens are dead...!"
27822,L195866,u879,m57,COOPER,What's happening?
27823,L195597,u887,m57,STARCK,It is not.
27824,L195596,u879,m57,COOPER,Is that an offer?
27825,L196337,u884,m57,MILLER,Oh God...
27826,L196336,u880,m57,DJ,Please... kill...
27827,L196335,u884,m57,MILLER,"Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I..."
27828,L196334,u880,m57,DJ,Please...
27829,L196323,u884,m57,MILLER,Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
27830,L196322,u880,m57,DJ,What happened?
27831,L196321,u884,m57,MILLER,DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
27832,L196237,u880,m57,DJ,"No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it."
27833,L196236,u884,m57,MILLER,"""Save yourself. From Hell.""  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?"
27834,L196235,u880,m57,DJ,"It sounds like ""ex infera:"" ""ex,"" from; ""infera,"" the ablative case of ""inferi."" ""Hell."""
27835,L196234,u884,m57,MILLER,Hear what?
27836,L196233,u880,m57,DJ,Do you hear it? Right there.
27837,L196231,u880,m57,DJ,It gets worse.
27838,L196230,u884,m57,MILLER,It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
27839,L196229,u880,m57,DJ,"They thought it said, ""Liberatis me,"" ""Save me,"" but it's not ""me."" It's ""tutemet:"" ""Save yourself."""
27840,L196228,u884,m57,MILLER,Go on.
27841,L196227,u880,m57,DJ,I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
27842,L196226,u884,m57,MILLER,What is it?
27843,L196225,u880,m57,DJ,No.
27844,L196224,u884,m57,MILLER,"I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide."
27845,L196222,u880,m57,DJ,"""Another man?"" Who?"
27846,L196221,u884,m57,MILLER,Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
27847,L196190,u884,m57,MILLER,We'll make it.
27848,L196189,u880,m57,DJ,He'll live... if we ever make it back.
27849,L196076,u884,m57,MILLER,"I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers."
27850,L196075,u880,m57,DJ,"To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep."
27851,L196048,u884,m57,MILLER,"Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared."
27852,L196047,u880,m57,DJ,"Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement..."
27853,L195941,u880,m57,DJ,"His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all."
27854,L195940,u884,m57,MILLER,How is he?
27855,L195919,u884,m57,MILLER,"No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers."
27856,L195918,u880,m57,DJ,We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
27857,L195648,u884,m57,MILLER,And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
27858,L195647,u880,m57,DJ,Trauma.
27859,L195646,u884,m57,MILLER,"He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ..."
27860,L196188,u880,m57,DJ,"One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out..."
27861,L196187,u885,m57,PETERS,His peritoneum has ruptured...
27862,L196186,u880,m57,DJ,"Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood..."
27863,L196184,u880,m57,DJ,He's crashing...
27864,L196183,u885,m57,PETERS,90 over 50 and falling... .
27865,L196182,u880,m57,DJ,Pressure?
27866,L196181,u885,m57,PETERS,"I've got a pulse, he's alive..."
27867,L196100,u885,m57,PETERS,You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
27868,L196099,u880,m57,DJ,What's wrong?
27869,L196023,u880,m57,DJ,A power drain --
27870,L196022,u885,m57,PETERS,What's happening...?
27871,L195984,u885,m57,PETERS,Nothing. It's nothing.
27872,L195983,u880,m57,DJ,What's wrong?
27873,L195564,u881,m57,HOLLIS,"Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors."
27874,L195563,u888,m57,WEIR,Thank you.
27875,L195562,u881,m57,HOLLIS,"It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day."
27876,L195551,u888,m57,WEIR,A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
27877,L195550,u881,m57,HOLLIS,"That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew..."
27878,L195549,u888,m57,WEIR,It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
27879,L195548,u881,m57,HOLLIS,I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
27880,L195547,u888,m57,WEIR,"Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?"
27881,L195545,u881,m57,HOLLIS,"I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?"
27882,L195544,u888,m57,WEIR,"You wanted to see me, Admiral?"
27883,L195575,u883,m57,LYLE,"The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four."
27884,L195574,u881,m57,HOLLIS,I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
27885,L195573,u883,m57,LYLE,Some things you don't get over.
27886,L195572,u881,m57,HOLLIS,It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
27887,L195571,u883,m57,LYLE,"He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife."
27888,L195570,u881,m57,HOLLIS,What's on your mind?
27889,L195569,u883,m57,LYLE,Does he know that?
27890,L195568,u881,m57,HOLLIS,That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
27891,L195567,u883,m57,LYLE,The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
27892,L195566,u881,m57,HOLLIS,"You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein."
27893,L195565,u883,m57,LYLE,You're not seriously considering sending him?
27894,L195557,u883,m57,LYLE,Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
27895,L195556,u881,m57,HOLLIS,"It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir."
27896,L196160,u885,m57,PETERS,Starck!
27897,L196159,u882,m57,JUSTIN,Oh my god OH MY GOD...
27898,L196148,u882,m57,JUSTIN,From the Other Place...
27899,L196147,u885,m57,PETERS,"""The dark inside...""? I don't understand."
27900,L196146,u882,m57,JUSTIN,...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
27901,L196145,u882,m57,JUSTIN,The dark inside me.
27902,L196144,u885,m57,PETERS,What does?
27903,L196143,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"It won't stop, it goes on and on and on..."
27904,L196142,u885,m57,PETERS,"What, Justin, what shows you?"
27905,L195827,u882,m57,JUSTIN,I'm going in.
27906,L195826,u888,m57,WEIR,"That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering."
27907,L195825,u882,m57,JUSTIN,I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
27908,L195802,u888,m57,WEIR,Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
27909,L195801,u882,m57,JUSTIN,We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
27910,L195800,u888,m57,WEIR,You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
27911,L195672,u888,m57,WEIR,I built it.
27912,L195671,u882,m57,JUSTIN,How do you know all this?
27913,L195670,u888,m57,WEIR,"...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive."
27914,L196174,u884,m57,MILLER,Justin. I won't let you die.
27915,L196173,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please..."
27916,L196172,u884,m57,MILLER,"You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?"
27917,L196171,u882,m57,JUSTIN,...I don't want to die...!
27918,L196167,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"Skipper, you gotta help me..."
27919,L196166,u884,m57,MILLER,Justin.
27920,L196165,u884,m57,MILLER,Patch me through to him.
27921,L195854,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"Almost done, I just gotta check one thing..."
27922,L195853,u884,m57,MILLER,"Justin, finish your sweep."
27923,L195755,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"Yes, sir!"
27924,L195754,u884,m57,MILLER,"Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on."
27925,L195583,u884,m57,MILLER,Start the countdown.
27926,L195582,u882,m57,JUSTIN,"Everything green on my boards, Skipper."
27927,L195561,u888,m57,WEIR,"Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship."
27928,L195560,u883,m57,LYLE,The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
27929,L195559,u888,m57,WEIR,The crew? Could they still be alive?
27930,L195558,u883,m57,LYLE,"Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes."
27931,L195555,u888,m57,WEIR,"This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go."
27932,L195554,u883,m57,LYLE,"I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this."
27933,L195553,u888,m57,WEIR,I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
27934,L195552,u883,m57,LYLE,"Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures."
27935,L195543,u883,m57,LYLE,"Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible."
27936,L195542,u888,m57,WEIR,This is Weir.
27937,L196194,u884,m57,MILLER,Thanks.
27938,L196193,u885,m57,PETERS,"I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there..."
27939,L196192,u884,m57,MILLER,Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
27940,L196115,u885,m57,PETERS,Justin.
27941,L196114,u884,m57,MILLER,"That's a negative, Starck."
27942,L196021,u884,m57,MILLER,Do it.
27943,L196020,u885,m57,PETERS,"I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up."
27944,L195947,u884,m57,MILLER,"Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan..."
27945,L195946,u885,m57,PETERS,"I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin..."
27946,L195945,u884,m57,MILLER,"Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers."
27947,L195890,u885,m57,PETERS,Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
27948,L195889,u884,m57,MILLER,...you okay?
27949,L195888,u884,m57,MILLER,Peters...
27950,L195887,u885,m57,PETERS,Skipper...
27951,L195886,u884,m57,MILLER,Can anybody hear me...
27952,L195852,u885,m57,PETERS,Crystallized.
27953,L195851,u884,m57,MILLER,...how's the client?
27954,L195850,u884,m57,MILLER,"Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters..."
27955,L195831,u885,m57,PETERS,Frozen.
27956,L195830,u884,m57,MILLER,Alive?
27957,L195829,u885,m57,PETERS,I found one.
27958,L195819,u884,m57,MILLER,"The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here."
27959,L195818,u885,m57,PETERS,"Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact."
27960,L195817,u884,m57,MILLER,"What you got, Peters?"
27961,L195816,u885,m57,PETERS,Okay. I'm on the bridge.
27962,L195812,u885,m57,PETERS,"There's no one here, Skipper."
27963,L195811,u884,m57,MILLER,"The blood came from somewhere, Peters..."
27964,L195792,u884,m57,MILLER,"Starck, you still showing those readings?"
27965,L195791,u885,m57,PETERS,I can see the hatch.
27966,L195788,u885,m57,PETERS,"I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing..."
27967,L195787,u884,m57,MILLER,"Peters is right, no one's here."
27968,L195783,u884,m57,MILLER,"So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?"
27969,L195782,u885,m57,PETERS,That means they didn't abandon ship.
27970,L195773,u884,m57,MILLER,Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
27971,L195772,u885,m57,PETERS,Jesus its huge.
27972,L195771,u884,m57,MILLER,Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
27973,L195770,u885,m57,PETERS,We've got pressure.
27974,L195595,u884,m57,MILLER,I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
27975,L195594,u885,m57,PETERS,"No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months."
27976,L195593,u884,m57,MILLER,I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
27977,L195592,u885,m57,PETERS,Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
27978,L195591,u884,m57,MILLER,What's the hold up?
27979,L196428,u888,m57,WEIR,NOOO!
27980,L196427,u884,m57,MILLER,You can't have them. Go to hell.
27981,L196425,u884,m57,MILLER,Starck... Cooper...
27982,L196424,u888,m57,WEIR,I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
27983,L196423,u884,m57,MILLER,You're lying...!
27984,L196422,u888,m57,WEIR,There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
27985,L196417,u888,m57,WEIR,Better if I just show you.
27986,L196416,u884,m57,MILLER,"Then what, what are you? Tell me..."
27987,L196415,u888,m57,WEIR,I'm not the Devil.
27988,L196414,u884,m57,MILLER,"You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!"
27989,L196413,u888,m57,WEIR,You know.
27990,L196412,u884,m57,MILLER,What are you?
27991,L196401,u888,m57,WEIR,"Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?"
27992,L196400,u884,m57,MILLER,Then who the fuck are you?
27993,L196399,u888,m57,WEIR,Weir is dead.
27994,L196348,u888,m57,WEIR,What makes you think I'll miss?
27995,L196347,u884,m57,MILLER,"If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too."
27996,L196343,u888,m57,WEIR,"Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience."
27997,L196342,u884,m57,MILLER,What are you talking about?
27998,L196341,u888,m57,WEIR,"I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see."
27999,L196340,u884,m57,MILLER,Your eyes...
28000,L196332,u884,m57,MILLER,Son of a bitch!
28001,L196331,u888,m57,WEIR,I told you... She won't let you leave...
28002,L196272,u884,m57,MILLER,"Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home."
28003,L196271,u888,m57,WEIR,You can't leave. She won't let you.
28004,L196265,u884,m57,MILLER,Watch me.
28005,L196264,u888,m57,WEIR,You... You can't do that!
28006,L196263,u884,m57,MILLER,We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
28007,L196262,u888,m57,WEIR,What about my ship?
28008,L196258,u884,m57,MILLER,It's done.
28009,L196257,u888,m57,WEIR,Don't... don't do this...
28010,L196256,u884,m57,MILLER,"Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark."
28011,L196255,u888,m57,WEIR,You're insane. You've lost your mind.
28012,L196254,u884,m57,MILLER,"""...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship."" The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us."
28013,L196253,u888,m57,WEIR,"You can't, your orders are specific..."
28014,L196252,u884,m57,MILLER,We're leaving.
28015,L196217,u884,m57,MILLER,"That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor."
28016,L196216,u888,m57,WEIR,I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
28017,L196215,u884,m57,MILLER,"The ""Other Place,"" what is that...?"
28018,L196214,u888,m57,WEIR,I don't know...
28019,L196213,u884,m57,MILLER,Where has it been for the past seven years?
28020,L196212,u888,m57,WEIR,I don't know...
28021,L196211,u884,m57,MILLER,To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
28022,L196210,u888,m57,WEIR,Yes...
28023,L196209,u884,m57,MILLER,You said this ship creates a gateway...
28024,L196208,u888,m57,WEIR,What do you want me to say?
28025,L196207,u884,m57,MILLER,That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
28026,L196206,u888,m57,WEIR,"Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --"
28027,L196205,u884,m57,MILLER,I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
28028,L196198,u888,m57,WEIR,Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
28029,L196197,u884,m57,MILLER,"Is that your ""expert opinion?"" The only answer we've had out of you is ""I don't know."""
28030,L196074,u884,m57,MILLER,Do it.
28031,L196073,u888,m57,WEIR,"I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain."
28032,L196072,u884,m57,MILLER,"We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time."
28033,L196031,u888,m57,WEIR,Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
28034,L196030,u884,m57,MILLER,"We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad."
28035,L196025,u888,m57,WEIR,The Core...!
28036,L196024,u884,m57,MILLER,"We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it."
28037,L196019,u888,m57,WEIR,I don't know.
28038,L196018,u884,m57,MILLER,What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
28039,L196009,u888,m57,WEIR,"Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead."
28040,L196008,u884,m57,MILLER,Explanation?
28041,L196005,u888,m57,WEIR,Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
28042,L196004,u884,m57,MILLER,It's 2041...
28043,L196003,u888,m57,WEIR,The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
28044,L196002,u884,m57,MILLER,What about it?
28045,L196001,u888,m57,WEIR,The date.
28046,L196000,u884,m57,MILLER,"You have something, Dr. Weir?"
28047,L195979,u884,m57,MILLER,Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.
28048,L195978,u888,m57,WEIR,"There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control."
28049,L195977,u884,m57,MILLER,I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
28050,L195976,u888,m57,WEIR,"If it worked, yes."
28051,L195975,u884,m57,MILLER,If it worked.
28052,L195974,u888,m57,WEIR,"""Insane?"" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day..."
28053,L195973,u884,m57,MILLER,It's insane.
28054,L195969,u884,m57,MILLER,How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
28055,L195968,u888,m57,WEIR,It's complicated...
28056,L195967,u884,m57,MILLER,What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
28057,L195966,u888,m57,WEIR,"It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark."
28058,L195965,u884,m57,MILLER,"Hold on, what's this ""gravitational distortion?"""
28059,L195953,u884,m57,MILLER,One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
28060,L195952,u888,m57,WEIR,Yes.
28061,L195910,u884,m57,MILLER,Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
28062,L195909,u888,m57,WEIR,"It beats dying, Mister Smith."
28063,L195799,u884,m57,MILLER,"They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward."
28064,L195798,u888,m57,WEIR,No one?
28065,L195797,u884,m57,MILLER,Negative.
28066,L195796,u888,m57,WEIR,Any survivors?
28067,L195790,u888,m57,WEIR,"Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead."
28068,L195789,u884,m57,MILLER,"Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep."
28069,L195781,u888,m57,WEIR,"In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat."
28070,L195780,u884,m57,MILLER,"I can see that, what're they for?"
28071,L195775,u884,m57,MILLER,"Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?"
28072,L195774,u888,m57,WEIR,You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
28073,L195760,u884,m57,MILLER,"-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job."
28074,L195759,u888,m57,WEIR,That is not acceptable --
28075,L195758,u884,m57,MILLER,"Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --"
28076,L195757,u888,m57,WEIR,"Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship..."
28077,L195756,u884,m57,MILLER,"Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge."
28078,L195742,u888,m57,WEIR,Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
28079,L195741,u884,m57,MILLER,"Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster."
28080,L195740,u888,m57,WEIR,That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
28081,L195689,u888,m57,WEIR,NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
28082,L195688,u884,m57,MILLER,What does it say?
28083,L195677,u888,m57,WEIR,That's what we're here to find out.
28084,L195676,u884,m57,MILLER,Where has it been for the last seven years?
28085,L195675,u888,m57,WEIR,"It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now."
28086,L195601,u884,m57,MILLER,"Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way."
28087,L195600,u888,m57,WEIR,I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
28088,L195599,u884,m57,MILLER,"Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why."
28089,L195598,u888,m57,WEIR,"Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity..."
28090,L195590,u884,m57,MILLER,"The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks."
28091,L195589,u888,m57,WEIR,"Captain Miller, I just want to say..."
28092,L196315,u884,m57,MILLER,Smith? Smith! Fuck!
28093,L196314,u886,m57,SMITH,"Where is it, where is it..."
28094,L196313,u884,m57,MILLER,Get out of there now!
28095,L196312,u886,m57,SMITH,"No, no, we just got her back together..."
28096,L196311,u884,m57,MILLER,Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
28097,L196310,u884,m57,MILLER,One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
28098,L196309,u886,m57,SMITH,"Come again, Skipper?"
28099,L196308,u884,m57,MILLER,"Smith, get out of there..."
28100,L196307,u886,m57,SMITH,"I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark."
28101,L196306,u884,m57,MILLER,"What is it, Smith?"
28102,L196305,u886,m57,SMITH,Skipper...
28103,L196286,u884,m57,MILLER,Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
28104,L196285,u886,m57,SMITH,"She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere."
28105,L196284,u884,m57,MILLER,Now what?
28106,L196283,u886,m57,SMITH,"Captain, we got a problem."
28107,L196282,u884,m57,MILLER,Thank you.
28108,L196071,u884,m57,MILLER,"Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly."
28109,L196070,u886,m57,SMITH,Sir.
28110,L196064,u884,m57,MILLER,That's enough!
28111,L196063,u886,m57,SMITH,"...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew..."
28112,L195939,u886,m57,SMITH,Understood.
28113,L195938,u884,m57,MILLER,"We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air."
28114,L195937,u886,m57,SMITH,"I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time."
28115,L195936,u884,m57,MILLER,"I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?"
28116,L195935,u886,m57,SMITH,"Captain Miller, you copy?"
28117,L195912,u884,m57,MILLER,"You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?"
28118,L195911,u886,m57,SMITH,But...
28119,L195903,u886,m57,SMITH,They're gone.
28120,L195902,u884,m57,MILLER,"No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?"
28121,L195901,u886,m57,SMITH,"We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead."
28122,L195900,u886,m57,SMITH,We don't have time to fart.
28123,L195899,u884,m57,MILLER,Do we have enough time for a weld?
28124,L195897,u886,m57,SMITH,We have a situation here...
28125,L195896,u884,m57,MILLER,"Smith, where the hell have you been?!"
28126,L195895,u886,m57,SMITH,Captain Miller...
28127,L195744,u884,m57,MILLER,"Starck, give me a read."
28128,L195743,u886,m57,SMITH,It is now.  We're locked in.
28129,L195735,u886,m57,SMITH,Love to.
28130,L195734,u884,m57,MILLER,"Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?"
28131,L195726,u884,m57,MILLER,Starck...
28132,L195725,u886,m57,SMITH,"Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!"
28133,L195722,u884,m57,MILLER,Where is it?
28134,L195721,u886,m57,SMITH,1500 meters. We're getting too close...
28135,L195717,u884,m57,MILLER,"I noticed. Starck, anybody home?"
28136,L195716,u886,m57,SMITH,We've got some weather.
28137,L195712,u884,m57,MILLER,Dr. Weir...!
28138,L195711,u886,m57,SMITH,"Yes, sir."
28139,L195710,u884,m57,MILLER,I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
28140,L195709,u886,m57,SMITH,"Something like that, yeah."
28141,L195708,u884,m57,MILLER,"What are you trying to say? ""If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"""
28142,L195707,u886,m57,SMITH,"That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know..."
28143,L195706,u884,m57,MILLER,"We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out..."
28144,L195703,u884,m57,MILLER,"Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening..."
28145,L195702,u886,m57,SMITH,"We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop."
28146,L195701,u886,m57,SMITH,One-four degrees...
28147,L195700,u884,m57,MILLER,...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
28148,L195699,u886,m57,SMITH,Heading three-three-four...
28149,L195683,u884,m57,MILLER,What is that?
28150,L195682,u886,m57,SMITH,Jesus...
28151,L195579,u886,m57,SMITH,Locked and cocked.
28152,L195578,u884,m57,MILLER,"I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?"
28153,L196395,u884,m57,MILLER,He's dead...
28154,L196394,u887,m57,STARCK,Weir.
28155,L196388,u887,m57,STARCK,"Miller, he's back, he was in the tank..."
28156,L196387,u884,m57,MILLER,"...repeat, we're armed..."
28157,L196386,u884,m57,MILLER,We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
28158,L196375,u884,m57,MILLER,No. I'll be right back.
28159,L196374,u887,m57,STARCK,I'll do it --
28160,L196369,u884,m57,MILLER,"We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put..."
28161,L196368,u887,m57,STARCK,Blow it up?
28162,L196367,u884,m57,MILLER,BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
28163,L196361,u887,m57,STARCK,"We've got to shut it down, we've got to..."
28164,L196360,u884,m57,MILLER,Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
28165,L196354,u884,m57,MILLER,Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
28166,L196353,u887,m57,STARCK,Weir can't be alive.
28167,L196177,u887,m57,STARCK,Five seconds.
28168,L196176,u884,m57,MILLER,"Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!"
28169,L196134,u887,m57,STARCK,"You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door."
28170,L196133,u884,m57,MILLER,"I'm on my way, Starck."
28171,L196125,u884,m57,MILLER,Stay here! Don't stop working!
28172,L196124,u887,m57,STARCK,"He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit."
28173,L196123,u884,m57,MILLER,What?
28174,L196122,u887,m57,STARCK,Justin's in the airlock.
28175,L196121,u884,m57,MILLER,"What's going on in there, Starck?"
28176,L196120,u887,m57,STARCK,"Miller, come in..."
28177,L196096,u884,m57,MILLER,I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
28178,L196095,u887,m57,STARCK,Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
28179,L196094,u884,m57,MILLER,What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
28180,L196093,u887,m57,STARCK,I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
28181,L196092,u884,m57,MILLER,"If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?"
28182,L196091,u887,m57,STARCK,I know that.
28183,L196090,u884,m57,MILLER,"Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible."
28184,L196089,u887,m57,STARCK,"It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports..."
28185,L196088,u884,m57,MILLER,We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
28186,L196087,u887,m57,STARCK,"I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us..."
28187,L196086,u884,m57,MILLER,To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
28188,L196085,u887,m57,STARCK,You've got to listen...
28189,L196083,u887,m57,STARCK,"There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system..."
28190,L196082,u884,m57,MILLER,Go ahead.
28191,L196081,u887,m57,STARCK,I've got a theory.
28192,L196080,u884,m57,MILLER,"""...bio-readings of indeterminate origin,"" don't you have anything useful to tell me?"
28193,L196079,u887,m57,STARCK,...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
28194,L196078,u884,m57,MILLER,"What is it, Starck?"
28195,L196077,u887,m57,STARCK,Miller...
28196,L196052,u884,m57,MILLER,"Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something..."
28197,L196051,u887,m57,STARCK,Who?
28198,L196050,u884,m57,MILLER,No. It was someone else.
28199,L196049,u887,m57,STARCK,Maybe one of the original crew?
28200,L195951,u884,m57,MILLER,Do it. Dr. Weir...
28201,L195950,u887,m57,STARCK,"I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins."
28202,L195949,u884,m57,MILLER,"Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found."
28203,L195948,u887,m57,STARCK,What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
28204,L195933,u884,m57,MILLER,So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
28205,L195932,u887,m57,STARCK,"I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew."
28206,L195931,u884,m57,MILLER,What's causing the readings?
28207,L195930,u887,m57,STARCK,"The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: ""Bio-readings of indeterminate origin."" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels."
28208,L195929,u884,m57,MILLER,What about the life readings you picked up?
28209,L195928,u887,m57,STARCK,"I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home."
28210,L195927,u884,m57,MILLER,We can take the filters from the Clark...
28211,L195926,u887,m57,STARCK,It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
28212,L195925,u884,m57,MILLER,Carbon dioxide?
28213,L195924,u887,m57,STARCK,Oxygen is not the problem.
28214,L195923,u884,m57,MILLER,How much oh-two do we have?
28215,L195922,u887,m57,STARCK,"The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us."
28216,L195921,u884,m57,MILLER,But you can breathe it.
28217,L195920,u887,m57,STARCK,It tastes bad.
28218,L195917,u884,m57,MILLER,Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
28219,L195916,u887,m57,STARCK,We're all here.
28220,L195915,u884,m57,MILLER,Everybody okay?
28221,L195794,u884,m57,MILLER,Keep your eyes open.
28222,L195793,u887,m57,STARCK,That's an affirmative.
28223,L195751,u887,m57,STARCK,"There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location."
28224,L195750,u884,m57,MILLER,Radiation interference?
28225,L195749,u887,m57,STARCK,Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
28226,L195698,u884,m57,MILLER,Come around to three-three-four...
28227,L195697,u887,m57,STARCK,Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
28228,L195635,u884,m57,MILLER,"Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go!  And Cooper... Put some pants on."
28229,L195634,u887,m57,STARCK,I just finished drying...
28230,L195633,u884,m57,MILLER,"Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?"
28231,L195585,u884,m57,MILLER,Let's go.
28232,L195584,u887,m57,STARCK,Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
28233,L195581,u884,m57,MILLER,Justin?
28234,L195580,u887,m57,STARCK,"We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready."
28235,L196057,u885,m57,PETERS,I've seen bodies before. This is different.
28236,L196056,u888,m57,WEIR,Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
28237,L196055,u885,m57,PETERS,About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were...
28238,L196054,u885,m57,PETERS,I did.
28239,L196053,u888,m57,WEIR,No. I saw nothing.
28240,L195810,u885,m57,PETERS,There's no one here.
28241,L195809,u888,m57,WEIR,Can you see a body?
28242,L195808,u885,m57,PETERS,Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
28243,L195807,u888,m57,WEIR,"Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?"
28244,L195804,u888,m57,WEIR,"You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?"
28245,L195803,u885,m57,PETERS,"Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?"
28246,L195779,u888,m57,WEIR,They're explosive charges.
28247,L195778,u885,m57,PETERS,Here's another one. They're all over the place.
28248,L195624,u885,m57,PETERS,DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
28249,L195623,u888,m57,WEIR,Claire...
28250,L195608,u885,m57,PETERS,"They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able..."
28251,L195607,u888,m57,WEIR,Wasn't that ship destroyed?
28252,L195606,u885,m57,PETERS,He served on the Goliath.
28253,L195605,u888,m57,WEIR,He's been past Mars?
28254,L195604,u885,m57,PETERS,"Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach."
28255,L195603,u888,m57,WEIR,Yes.
28256,L195602,u885,m57,PETERS,First time in a grav couch?
28257,L196248,u885,m57,PETERS,I don't care.
28258,L196247,u887,m57,STARCK,It's cold.
28259,L196246,u885,m57,PETERS,You got any coffee?
28260,L196164,u887,m57,STARCK,"Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay..."
28261,L196163,u885,m57,PETERS,"We have to do something, oh God..."
28262,L196154,u885,m57,PETERS,"Come on, Baby-bear, open this door..."
28263,L196153,u887,m57,STARCK,Almost got it.
28264,L196139,u885,m57,PETERS,Do you know what it was?
28265,L196138,u887,m57,STARCK,Keep him talking.
28266,L196137,u885,m57,PETERS,"Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it."
28267,L196129,u885,m57,PETERS,Can you shut it down?
28268,L196128,u887,m57,STARCK,He's engaged the override.
28269,L195786,u887,m57,STARCK,Not according to the computer.
28270,L195785,u885,m57,PETERS,There's no one in the corridor but us.
28271,L196061,u886,m57,SMITH,Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
28272,L196060,u888,m57,WEIR,"Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith."
28273,L196059,u886,m57,SMITH,I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
28274,L195906,u888,m57,WEIR,"It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support."
28275,L195905,u886,m57,SMITH,What?
28276,L195884,u888,m57,WEIR,We're losing atmosphere...
28277,L195883,u886,m57,SMITH,The safety circuit's failed!
28278,L195849,u888,m57,WEIR,That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
28279,L195848,u886,m57,SMITH,What the hell is that?
28280,L195738,u886,m57,SMITH,"Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber..."
28281,L195737,u888,m57,WEIR,"Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?"
28282,L195731,u888,m57,WEIR,She's not ugly.
28283,L195730,u886,m57,SMITH,"Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker..."
28284,L195715,u886,m57,SMITH,"Dead ahead, 5000 meters."
28285,L195714,u888,m57,WEIR,Where is she?
28286,L195667,u888,m57,WEIR,"Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from ""point A"" here...  ...to ""point B,"" here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?"
28287,L195666,u886,m57,SMITH,Hey...
28288,L195908,u886,m57,SMITH,"I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship..."
28289,L195907,u887,m57,STARCK,What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
28290,L195865,u887,m57,STARCK,"I'm trying, goddammit --"
28291,L195864,u886,m57,SMITH,Get them back --
28292,L195863,u887,m57,STARCK,"Miller, do you read me, Peters --"
28293,L195834,u887,m57,STARCK,Decompression wouldn't do that.
28294,L195833,u886,m57,SMITH,Explosive decompression.
28295,L195832,u887,m57,STARCK,What happened to his eyes?
28296,L195733,u887,m57,STARCK,Picking up magnetic interference.
28297,L195732,u886,m57,SMITH,Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
28298,L195724,u886,m57,SMITH,1000 meters...
28299,L195723,u887,m57,STARCK,"The scope is lit, it's right in front of us..."
28300,L195719,u886,m57,SMITH,Range 3000 meters and closing.
28301,L195718,u887,m57,STARCK,"If they are, they're screening their calls."
28302,L195705,u886,m57,SMITH,"Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this..."
28303,L195704,u887,m57,STARCK,"This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing..."
28304,L195661,u887,m57,STARCK,The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
28305,L195660,u886,m57,SMITH,You can't do that.
28306,L195639,u887,m57,STARCK,"All boards are green, everything's five by five."
28307,L195638,u886,m57,SMITH,30 hours to Neptune orbit.
28308,L195577,u887,m57,STARCK,"Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own."
28309,L195576,u886,m57,SMITH,"I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women..."
28310,L196196,u888,m57,WEIR,It means nothing.
28311,L196195,u887,m57,STARCK,"Justin said something about, ""The dark inside me..."" What did he mean?"
28312,L196113,u887,m57,STARCK,"Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?"
28313,L196112,u888,m57,WEIR,The forward airlock.
28314,L196111,u887,m57,STARCK,What is it?
28315,L196110,u888,m57,WEIR,I'm alright. Please.
28316,L196109,u887,m57,STARCK,"In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset."
28317,L196107,u888,m57,WEIR,It wants me. I have to go.
28318,L196106,u887,m57,STARCK,What are you doing?
28319,L196007,u888,m57,WEIR,"No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years."
28320,L196006,u887,m57,STARCK,Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
28321,L195998,u887,m57,STARCK,I'm sorry.
28322,L195997,u888,m57,WEIR,Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
28323,L195996,u887,m57,STARCK,"It must be hard, being so far away from her."
28324,L195995,u888,m57,WEIR,Yes.
28325,L195994,u887,m57,STARCK,Claire is your wife?
28326,L195993,u888,m57,WEIR,"Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all."
28327,L195992,u887,m57,STARCK,"Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love."
28328,L195972,u887,m57,STARCK,I can't believe we built this.
28329,L195971,u888,m57,WEIR,"That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light."
28330,L195859,u887,m57,STARCK,I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
28331,L195858,u888,m57,WEIR,What is it?
28332,L195822,u888,m57,WEIR,Ship's log.
28333,L195821,u887,m57,STARCK,What is it?
28334,L195753,u887,m57,STARCK,"If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense."
28335,L195752,u888,m57,WEIR,"Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?"
28336,L195747,u887,m57,STARCK,Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
28337,L195746,u888,m57,WEIR,Do they have pressure?
28338,L195745,u887,m57,STARCK,"The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious."
28339,L195669,u888,m57,WEIR,Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
28340,L195668,u887,m57,STARCK,A straight line.
28341,L195664,u888,m57,WEIR,"Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity..."
28342,L195663,u887,m57,STARCK,How?
28343,L195662,u888,m57,WEIR,"Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously ""jump"" from one point in the universe to another, light years away."
28344,L203901,u890,m58,BEN,I like the sound of that.
28345,L203900,u889,m58,ALICIA,We're going to have to work on your touch.
28346,L203694,u889,m58,ALICIA,My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
28347,L203693,u890,m58,BEN,Those yours too?
28348,L203692,u890,m58,BEN,"No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty..."
28349,L203691,u889,m58,ALICIA,"Relax, it's casual."
28350,L203690,u890,m58,BEN,I'm not really dressed for a party.
28351,L203689,u889,m58,ALICIA,"I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?"
28352,L203688,u890,m58,BEN,How'd you know it was me?
28353,L203562,u890,m58,BEN,"Trust me, this ain't one of those times."
28354,L203561,u889,m58,ALICIA,"Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing."
28355,L203558,u890,m58,BEN,"You wouldn't say that, if you could see me."
28356,L203557,u889,m58,ALICIA,I don't think She's real big on hate.
28357,L203702,u889,m58,ALICIA,"Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?"
28358,L203701,u898,m58,THE THING,I mean...
28359,L203700,u889,m58,ALICIA,I wouldn't know anything about that.
28360,L203699,u898,m58,THE THING,"You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --"
28361,L203697,u898,m58,THE THING,This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
28362,L203696,u889,m58,ALICIA,"""Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."""
28363,L203695,u898,m58,THE THING,"You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals."
28364,L203830,u890,m58,BEN,Victor must've taken him.
28365,L203829,u897,m58,SUE,Where is Reed?
28366,L203647,u897,m58,SUE,"No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben."
28367,L203646,u890,m58,BEN,It's easy for you to be patient.
28368,L203645,u897,m58,SUE,Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
28369,L203644,u890,m58,BEN,It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
28370,L203643,u897,m58,SUE,He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
28371,L203604,u897,m58,SUE,What did he do to the uniform?!
28372,L203603,u890,m58,BEN,"Oh, he did."
28373,L203602,u897,m58,SUE,He didn't.
28374,L203501,u890,m58,BEN,I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
28375,L203500,u897,m58,SUE,The suit will stretch. You should try it --
28376,L203499,u890,m58,BEN,You look like an eighties rock band.
28377,L203450,u890,m58,BEN,Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
28378,L203449,u897,m58,SUE,"We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped."
28379,L203265,u890,m58,BEN,Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
28380,L203264,u897,m58,SUE,"I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor."
28381,L203128,u890,m58,BEN,Is it safe?
28382,L203127,u897,m58,SUE,We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
28383,L203091,u897,m58,SUE,Victor did.
28384,L203090,u890,m58,BEN,I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
28385,L203073,u897,m58,SUE,I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
28386,L203072,u890,m58,BEN,Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
28387,L203798,u890,m58,BEN,And you can? Power it up?
28388,L203797,u899,m58,VICTOR,"He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for ""Mr. Fantastic."""
28389,L203796,u899,m58,VICTOR,He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
28390,L203795,u890,m58,BEN,Reed said it'd be weeks till --
28391,L203794,u899,m58,VICTOR,To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
28392,L203793,u890,m58,BEN,"What do you want, Vic?"
28393,L203790,u899,m58,VICTOR,Where do you think? With Sue.
28394,L203789,u890,m58,BEN,What is this? Where's Reed?
28395,L203788,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Ben, come in."
28396,L203738,u899,m58,VICTOR,Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
28397,L203737,u890,m58,BEN,About me? How sweet.
28398,L203736,u899,m58,VICTOR,I'm worried about you.
28399,L203735,u890,m58,BEN,What are you doing here?
28400,L203546,u890,m58,BEN,I already got it. Everything I want.
28401,L203545,u891,m58,DEBBIE,"What did you wish for, honey?"
28402,L203330,u890,m58,BEN,"Deb, it's me. It's still me."
28403,L203329,u891,m58,DEBBIE,Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
28404,L203328,u891,m58,DEBBIE,"Baby, you're scaring me."
28405,L203327,u890,m58,BEN,"Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said ""together forever no matter what""?"
28406,L203326,u891,m58,DEBBIE,Ben?
28407,L203324,u891,m58,DEBBIE,"Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you."
28408,L203323,u890,m58,BEN,Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
28409,L203114,u891,m58,DEBBIE,"I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man."
28410,L203113,u890,m58,BEN,"Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock."
28411,L203112,u891,m58,DEBBIE,"Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom."
28412,L203111,u890,m58,BEN,I'll be watching over you.
28413,L203898,u890,m58,BEN,"Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is."
28414,L203897,u895,m58,REED,"Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings..."
28415,L203888,u890,m58,BEN,"Got it, teach."
28416,L203887,u895,m58,REED,"Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben..."
28417,L203754,u895,m58,REED,"Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--"
28418,L203753,u890,m58,BEN,"Glad ""nothing"" could take you away from your work."
28419,L203751,u890,m58,BEN,Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
28420,L203750,u895,m58,REED,We're working as hard as we can --
28421,L203749,u890,m58,BEN,"Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?"
28422,L203748,u895,m58,REED,Ben --
28423,L203629,u895,m58,REED,"This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again."
28424,L203628,u890,m58,BEN,It's about to be a broken face.
28425,L203468,u895,m58,REED,O-kay. We'll skip that question.
28426,L203467,u890,m58,BEN,Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
28427,L203466,u895,m58,REED,"Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --"
28428,L203465,u890,m58,BEN,Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
28429,L203464,u895,m58,REED,"Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal..."
28430,L203448,u895,m58,REED,"If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes."
28431,L203447,u890,m58,BEN,You got a chisel round here?
28432,L203413,u890,m58,BEN,"Yeah, nine years straight."
28433,L203412,u895,m58,REED,We had a tough year.
28434,L203368,u890,m58,BEN,Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
28435,L203367,u895,m58,REED,Ben. Are you okay?
28436,L203366,u890,m58,BEN,What the --!
28437,L203270,u890,m58,BEN,I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
28438,L203269,u895,m58,REED,Are you alright?
28439,L203242,u890,m58,BEN,Well maybe you should date him.
28440,L203241,u895,m58,REED,"He's smart, powerful, successful --"
28441,L203240,u890,m58,BEN,"I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?"
28442,L203239,u895,m58,REED,What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
28443,L203238,u890,m58,BEN,"Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie."
28444,L203237,u895,m58,REED,"Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --"
28445,L203236,u890,m58,BEN,"You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life."
28446,L203234,u895,m58,REED,"I should have done more, run more tests --"
28447,L203233,u890,m58,BEN,Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
28448,L203232,u895,m58,REED,I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
28449,L203230,u890,m58,BEN,Solid.
28450,L203229,u895,m58,REED,Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
28451,L203228,u890,m58,BEN,How long was I out?
28452,L203164,u895,m58,REED,Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
28453,L203163,u890,m58,BEN,"I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead."
28454,L203130,u890,m58,BEN,Should?
28455,L203129,u895,m58,REED,The shields on the station should protect us.
28456,L203110,u895,m58,REED,Victor's better at these things.
28457,L203109,u890,m58,BEN,"This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there."
28458,L203108,u895,m58,REED,He's made a few changes.
28459,L203107,u890,m58,BEN,Isn't that your speech?
28460,L203087,u890,m58,BEN,This makes five.
28461,L203086,u895,m58,REED,I had it at four.
28462,L203085,u890,m58,BEN,Five times.
28463,L203084,u895,m58,REED,When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
28464,L203083,u895,m58,REED,I'm sure he's matured since then.
28465,L203082,u890,m58,BEN,They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
28466,L203081,u895,m58,REED,Youthful high spirits.
28467,L203080,u890,m58,BEN,No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
28468,L203079,u895,m58,REED,"External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --"
28469,L203078,u890,m58,BEN,Can't do it. I cannot do it.
28470,L203066,u890,m58,BEN,"I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which..."
28471,L203065,u895,m58,REED,We got what we wanted. That's enough.
28472,L203064,u890,m58,BEN,Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
28473,L203063,u895,m58,REED,"Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --"
28474,L203062,u890,m58,BEN,He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
28475,L203053,u895,m58,REED,"Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives."
28476,L203052,u890,m58,BEN,What about his first born?
28477,L203038,u895,m58,REED,Ben. This is business. Just work.
28478,L203037,u890,m58,BEN,I can't take this.
28479,L203022,u890,m58,BEN,You'd never know it.
28480,L203021,u895,m58,REED,He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
28481,L203020,u895,m58,REED,"This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life."
28482,L203019,u890,m58,BEN,"Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --"
28483,L203911,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through."
28484,L203910,u890,m58,BEN,No more cracks about how I look.
28485,L203828,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
28486,L203827,u890,m58,BEN,The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
28487,L203765,u890,m58,BEN,Go back to the drawing board.
28488,L203764,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Hey! That's a prototype!
28489,L203196,u890,m58,BEN,Give me the god damn mirror!
28490,L203195,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --"
28491,L203194,u890,m58,BEN,Give me a mirror...
28492,L203193,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --"
28493,L203192,u890,m58,BEN,What's wrong with me?
28494,L203191,u893,m58,JOHNNY,They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
28495,L203190,u890,m58,BEN,Reed?... Sue?
28496,L203189,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
28497,L203188,u890,m58,BEN,Where... where am I?
28498,L203144,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Don't you wander off, boy."
28499,L203143,u890,m58,BEN,Put your tiny little mind at ease.
28500,L203142,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up."
28501,L203141,u890,m58,BEN,"Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either."
28502,L203140,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Yeah, well, his eyes say different."
28503,L203139,u890,m58,BEN,'Course not. Strictly business.
28504,L203138,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
28505,L203122,u890,m58,BEN,"Keep talking, there won't be a next time."
28506,L203121,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive."
28507,L203116,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look."
28508,L203115,u890,m58,BEN,"What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --"
28509,L203519,u899,m58,VICTOR,That's terrible news...
28510,L203518,u892,m58,DOCTOR,But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
28511,L203516,u892,m58,DOCTOR,The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
28512,L203515,u899,m58,VICTOR,What?
28513,L203514,u892,m58,DOCTOR,I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
28514,L203513,u899,m58,VICTOR,"What do you mean ""complete""?"
28515,L203512,u892,m58,DOCTOR,"At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --"
28516,L203511,u899,m58,VICTOR,Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
28517,L203510,u892,m58,DOCTOR,I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
28518,L203509,u899,m58,VICTOR,And they're changing into...
28519,L203508,u892,m58,DOCTOR,"Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --"
28520,L203251,u896,m58,SEXY NURSE,No: You're ON FIRE!
28521,L203250,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Not this again --
28522,L203249,u896,m58,SEXY NURSE,You're on fire!
28523,L203248,u896,m58,SEXY NURSE,Last one down springs for room service.
28524,L203247,u893,m58,JOHNNY,I though we went over this.
28525,L203246,u896,m58,SEXY NURSE,Stay right. Left is trouble.
28526,L203245,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Me like-y.
28527,L203227,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up."
28528,L203226,u896,m58,SEXY NURSE,"My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --"
28529,L203225,u893,m58,JOHNNY,I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
28530,L203224,u896,m58,SEXY NURSE,"I mean, you feel a little feverish."
28531,L203223,u893,m58,JOHNNY,So are you!
28532,L203222,u896,m58,SEXY NURSE,You're hot!
28533,L203214,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"I don't know if ""we've"" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --"
28534,L203213,u896,m58,SEXY NURSE,And where do we think we're going?
28535,L203882,u895,m58,REED,Now.
28536,L203881,u893,m58,JOHNNY,But all these people...
28537,L203880,u895,m58,REED,Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
28538,L203639,u895,m58,REED,A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
28539,L203638,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?"
28540,L203637,u895,m58,REED,You need to control yourself and think before you --
28541,L203550,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Right, whatever, have fun."
28542,L203549,u895,m58,REED,"That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --"
28543,L203503,u895,m58,REED,They're not costumes.
28544,L203502,u893,m58,JOHNNY,He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
28545,L203472,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?"
28546,L203471,u895,m58,REED,What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
28547,L203470,u893,m58,JOHNNY,What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
28548,L203469,u895,m58,REED,"Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --"
28549,L203462,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
28550,L203461,u895,m58,REED,"Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it."
28551,L203456,u893,m58,JOHNNY,I can go hotter!
28552,L203455,u895,m58,REED,"Back it down, Johnny!"
28553,L203426,u895,m58,REED,...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
28554,L203425,u893,m58,JOHNNY,This place is deluxe. You got cable?
28555,L203424,u895,m58,REED,We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
28556,L203415,u895,m58,REED,"Oh, it is."
28557,L203414,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
28558,L203393,u893,m58,JOHNNY,What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
28559,L203392,u895,m58,REED,Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
28560,L203360,u895,m58,REED,You've been working out.
28561,L203359,u893,m58,JOHNNY,This is wrong in so many ways.
28562,L203304,u895,m58,REED,"Ben, are you there?"
28563,L203303,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!"
28564,L203295,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
28565,L203294,u895,m58,REED,The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
28566,L203293,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Now what is up with that?
28567,L203186,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Ben! Ben!
28568,L203185,u895,m58,REED,He's not responsive --
28569,L203179,u893,m58,JOHNNY,What about you?
28570,L203178,u895,m58,REED,"Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields."
28571,L203840,u897,m58,SUE,But Johnny... you can't fly.
28572,L203839,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
28573,L203838,u897,m58,SUE,What are you doing --
28574,L203825,u897,m58,SUE,"No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out."
28575,L203824,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --"
28576,L203772,u897,m58,SUE,"As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them."
28577,L203771,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --"
28578,L203770,u897,m58,SUE,"Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --"
28579,L203769,u893,m58,JOHNNY,At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
28580,L203768,u897,m58,SUE,"Is that what you call it? ""Real""?"
28581,L203767,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world."
28582,L203766,u897,m58,SUE,Johnny? Did you see Ben?
28583,L203635,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Blockhead started it!
28584,L203634,u897,m58,SUE,You two need a time-out.
28585,L203627,u897,m58,SUE,"You gave us names? What are you, the ""face"" of the Fantastic Four now?"
28586,L203626,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!"
28587,L203623,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Dude. That's my sister.
28588,L203622,u897,m58,SUE,I'm driving.
28589,L203610,u897,m58,SUE,Girl...?!
28590,L203609,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl."
28591,L203460,u897,m58,SUE,That's the temperature of the sun.
28592,L203459,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Sweet.
28593,L203458,u897,m58,SUE,"You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --"
28594,L203457,u893,m58,JOHNNY,You're really cramping my style here.
28595,L203423,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool."
28596,L203422,u897,m58,SUE,"Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?"
28597,L203421,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
28598,L203310,u897,m58,SUE,I think that thing is Ben.
28599,L203309,u893,m58,JOHNNY,What is that thing?
28600,L203302,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Okay, ""mom."""
28601,L203301,u897,m58,SUE,Stop it.
28602,L203300,u897,m58,SUE,Johnny.
28603,L203299,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --"
28604,L203297,u893,m58,JOHNNY,Please tell me you go silent too.
28605,L203296,u897,m58,SUE,Apparently I can disappear.
28606,L203093,u893,m58,JOHNNY,"Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!"
28607,L203092,u897,m58,SUE,"The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --"
28608,L203336,u894,m58,LEONARD,"Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington."
28609,L203335,u899,m58,VICTOR,Front page?
28610,L203334,u894,m58,LEONARD,"Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --"
28611,L203333,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press."
28612,L203263,u899,m58,VICTOR,"That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar ""why England,"" he said, ""because it's not mine."""
28613,L203262,u894,m58,LEONARD,"Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --"
28614,L203261,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing..."
28615,L203260,u894,m58,LEONARD,"You know, maybe you should get some rest --"
28616,L203259,u899,m58,VICTOR,And that's a good thing?
28617,L203258,u894,m58,LEONARD,"Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar ""humanizes"" you."
28618,L203257,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side."
28619,L203256,u894,m58,LEONARD,"Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --"
28620,L203255,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose."
28621,L203254,u894,m58,LEONARD,"Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --"
28622,L203253,u899,m58,VICTOR,How's the IPO?
28623,L203126,u894,m58,LEONARD,"Recording, sir. We see you perfectly."
28624,L203125,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Leonard, how's the feed?"
28625,L203104,u899,m58,VICTOR,"History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?"
28626,L203103,u894,m58,LEONARD,Then what is it?
28627,L203102,u899,m58,VICTOR,It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
28628,L203101,u894,m58,LEONARD,"Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --"
28629,L203100,u899,m58,VICTOR,Showtime.
28630,L203099,u894,m58,LEONARD,"They're ready for you, sir."
28631,L203061,u899,m58,VICTOR,Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
28632,L203060,u894,m58,LEONARD,And if he's not...?
28633,L203059,u899,m58,VICTOR,"If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering."
28634,L203904,u897,m58,SUE,"A gasket? Reed, we're at a party."
28635,L203903,u895,m58,REED,"I found a broken gasket, from space --"
28636,L203885,u897,m58,SUE,I'm sure I can come up with something.
28637,L203884,u895,m58,REED,"Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --"
28638,L203779,u897,m58,SUE,You need a doctor.
28639,L203778,u895,m58,REED,The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
28640,L203777,u897,m58,SUE,"Reed, stop, you need to rest your --"
28641,L203776,u895,m58,REED,I can... make it work.
28642,L203726,u897,m58,SUE,That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
28643,L203725,u895,m58,REED,Why didn't you say something?
28644,L203724,u897,m58,SUE,"When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me."
28645,L203723,u897,m58,SUE,"I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man."
28646,L203722,u895,m58,REED,You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
28647,L203719,u897,m58,SUE,I gave him twenty.
28648,L203718,u895,m58,REED,"You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?"
28649,L203717,u897,m58,SUE,Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
28650,L203716,u895,m58,REED,You were?
28651,L203715,u897,m58,SUE,"Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous."
28652,L203714,u897,m58,SUE,Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
28653,L203713,u895,m58,REED,I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
28654,L203682,u895,m58,REED,"I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there."
28655,L203681,u897,m58,SUE,"Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --"
28656,L203680,u895,m58,REED,"Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --"
28657,L203679,u897,m58,SUE,Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
28658,L203678,u895,m58,REED,"He was going to take away all my data, equipment --"
28659,L203677,u897,m58,SUE,Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
28660,L203596,u895,m58,REED,"No way to know. Without more tests, experiments."
28661,L203595,u897,m58,SUE,Reed. How close are we to a cure?
28662,L203531,u895,m58,REED,"With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid..."
28663,L203530,u897,m58,SUE,And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
28664,L203529,u895,m58,REED,Of course. Of course.
28665,L203528,u897,m58,SUE,"But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?"
28666,L203527,u895,m58,REED,"Curing countless diseases, not just ours."
28667,L203526,u897,m58,SUE,And reverse the mutations --
28668,L203525,u895,m58,REED,"If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --"
28669,L203524,u895,m58,REED,"The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm."
28670,L203523,u897,m58,SUE,What are you doing?
28671,L203494,u897,m58,SUE,"No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does."
28672,L203493,u895,m58,REED,There were a lot of variables to consider --
28673,L203492,u897,m58,SUE,I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
28674,L203491,u895,m58,REED,I think it was a little more complicated than --
28675,L203490,u897,m58,SUE,"Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked."
28676,L203489,u895,m58,REED,"No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo..."
28677,L203488,u897,m58,SUE,Are you kidding?
28678,L203487,u895,m58,REED,"I mean, you broke up with me, right?"
28679,L203486,u895,m58,REED,What in the world would give me that idea?
28680,L203485,u897,m58,SUE,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --"
28681,L203483,u897,m58,SUE,I'm sure I can come up with something.
28682,L203482,u895,m58,REED,Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
28683,L203481,u897,m58,SUE,Anger. Rage. Frustration.
28684,L203480,u895,m58,REED,"I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --"
28685,L203479,u897,m58,SUE,Excuse me?
28686,L203478,u895,m58,REED,"You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --"
28687,L203474,u897,m58,SUE,What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
28688,L203473,u895,m58,REED,"It's not ""invisibility"" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge."
28689,L203420,u897,m58,SUE,"If it happened to him, then it could..."
28690,L203419,u895,m58,REED,That's what we're here to find out.
28691,L203418,u897,m58,SUE,How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
28692,L203358,u897,m58,SUE,What...?  Oh.
28693,L203357,u895,m58,REED,Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
28694,L203355,u895,m58,REED,We need to get past them.
28695,L203354,u897,m58,SUE,What?
28696,L203292,u895,m58,REED,"Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap."
28697,L203291,u897,m58,SUE,It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
28698,L203289,u895,m58,REED,Sue... look at your hands.
28699,L203288,u897,m58,SUE,What? What do you mean you --
28700,L203287,u895,m58,REED,"Uh, Sue...? I can't."
28701,L203282,u897,m58,SUE,"You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics."
28702,L203281,u895,m58,REED,For science.
28703,L203280,u895,m58,REED,Passion.
28704,L203279,u897,m58,SUE,Which was?
28705,L203278,u895,m58,REED,I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
28706,L203277,u897,m58,SUE,You're happy for me and Victor.
28707,L203275,u897,m58,SUE,You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
28708,L203274,u895,m58,REED,That's good. That's uh... good.
28709,L203273,u897,m58,SUE,"Yes, thanks."
28710,L203272,u895,m58,REED,Feeling better?
28711,L203096,u897,m58,SUE,Great minds think alike.
28712,L203095,u895,m58,REED,Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
28713,L203077,u897,m58,SUE,"Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny..."
28714,L203076,u895,m58,REED,"As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --"
28715,L203075,u897,m58,SUE,It's been changed.
28716,L203074,u895,m58,REED,"I, uh, think I remember the number."
28717,L203071,u897,m58,SUE,Right. That's exactly what I meant.
28718,L203070,u895,m58,REED,"Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--"
28719,L203069,u897,m58,SUE,I was talking about us. Working together.
28720,L203068,u895,m58,REED,"Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --"
28721,L203045,u897,m58,SUE,Never better.
28722,L203044,u895,m58,REED,"You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--"
28723,L203670,u899,m58,VICTOR,Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
28724,L203669,u895,m58,REED,But I'm not done with the machine --
28725,L203668,u899,m58,VICTOR,"What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me."
28726,L203667,u895,m58,REED,What are you doing here?
28727,L203443,u899,m58,VICTOR,I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
28728,L203442,u895,m58,REED,"Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --"
28729,L203441,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --"
28730,L203440,u895,m58,REED,"I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --"
28731,L203439,u899,m58,VICTOR,Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
28732,L203436,u895,m58,REED,Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
28733,L203435,u899,m58,VICTOR,I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
28734,L203316,u895,m58,REED,He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
28735,L203315,u899,m58,VICTOR,Ben did this?
28736,L203314,u895,m58,REED,Ben did this.
28737,L203313,u899,m58,VICTOR,Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
28738,L203172,u899,m58,VICTOR,"It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us."
28739,L203171,u895,m58,REED,Not until Ben is back inside!
28740,L203168,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Reed, we're running out of time."
28741,L203167,u895,m58,REED,"Come on, Ben, come on..."
28742,L203161,u899,m58,VICTOR,So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
28743,L203160,u895,m58,REED,Ben's still out there --
28744,L203159,u899,m58,VICTOR,Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
28745,L203158,u895,m58,REED,"We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort."
28746,L203137,u895,m58,REED,Sure.
28747,L203136,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second."
28748,L203058,u895,m58,REED,Hilarious.
28749,L203057,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Funny how things turn out, isn't it?"
28750,L203051,u899,m58,VICTOR,The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
28751,L203050,u895,m58,REED,"You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --"
28752,L203047,u895,m58,REED,Not at all.
28753,L203046,u899,m58,VICTOR,"This isn't going to be a problem, is it?"
28754,L203034,u895,m58,REED,You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
28755,L203033,u899,m58,VICTOR,"But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back."
28756,L203577,u897,m58,SUE,"Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready."
28757,L203576,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Oh, I think you already have."
28758,L203575,u897,m58,SUE,Please don't make this personal --
28759,L203574,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project."
28760,L203573,u897,m58,SUE,"If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us."
28761,L203572,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?"
28762,L203571,u897,m58,SUE,"He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --"
28763,L203569,u899,m58,VICTOR,Susan. What are you doing?
28764,L203568,u897,m58,SUE,"Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --"
28765,L203567,u899,m58,VICTOR,It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
28766,L203566,u897,m58,SUE,You said it was urgent.
28767,L203431,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care."
28768,L203430,u897,m58,SUE,I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
28769,L203429,u899,m58,VICTOR,"I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about."
28770,L203428,u897,m58,SUE,"Victor, your scar --"
28771,L203319,u899,m58,VICTOR,Just find him.
28772,L203318,u897,m58,SUE,"Victor, I'm sorry I --"
28773,L203312,u897,m58,SUE,"Victor, are you feeling alright?"
28774,L203311,u899,m58,VICTOR,What's going on?
28775,L203175,u897,m58,SUE,You can't leave them out there.
28776,L203174,u899,m58,VICTOR,Raising the shields.
28777,L203173,u897,m58,SUE,What are you doing?
28778,L203155,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives..."
28779,L203154,u897,m58,SUE,"Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think..."
28780,L203153,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --"
28781,L203152,u897,m58,SUE,"It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much."
28782,L203147,u899,m58,VICTOR,"Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past."
28783,L203146,u897,m58,SUE,I understand the business reasons.
28784,L203145,u899,m58,VICTOR,Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
28785,L203041,u899,m58,VICTOR,"I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm."
28786,L203040,u897,m58,SUE,It's just business.
28787,L203745,u898,m58,THE THING,Skeptical...?
28788,L203744,u899,m58,VICTOR,For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
28789,L203743,u898,m58,THE THING,Reed's gonna fix me up --
28790,L203742,u899,m58,VICTOR,"I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back."
28791,L203741,u898,m58,THE THING,If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
28792,L203740,u899,m58,VICTOR,"I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back..."
28793,L203739,u898,m58,THE THING,'Scuse me.
28794,L206502,u900,m59,ARNOLD,All right!!
28795,L206501,u901,m59,BRAD,I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
28796,L206500,u900,m59,ARNOLD,"Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys."
28797,L206499,u901,m59,BRAD,You want to work at Carl's?
28798,L206498,u900,m59,ARNOLD,"Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill."
28799,L206497,u901,m59,BRAD,Arnold. What's happening?
28800,L206496,u900,m59,ARNOLD,"Brad, can I talk to you a minute?"
28801,L206828,u911,m59,LISA,"Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing."
28802,L206827,u901,m59,BRAD,"I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year."
28803,L206826,u901,m59,BRAD,Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
28804,L206825,u911,m59,LISA,If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
28805,L206824,u901,m59,BRAD,"Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again."
28806,L206668,u911,m59,LISA,"I don't want to talk about it here, Brad."
28807,L206667,u901,m59,BRAD,Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
28808,L206666,u911,m59,LISA,Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
28809,L206665,u901,m59,BRAD,"What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and..."
28810,L206662,u901,m59,BRAD,Don't worry about it.
28811,L206661,u911,m59,LISA,How much did they cost?
28812,L206660,u901,m59,BRAD,Of course.
28813,L206659,u911,m59,LISA,"Were those flowers really for me, Brad?"
28814,L207325,u901,m59,BRAD,Later.
28815,L207324,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Easy, mon."
28816,L207236,u914,m59,SPICOLI,There it is!
28817,L207235,u901,m59,BRAD,First door on your left!
28818,L207234,u914,m59,SPICOLI,On the ledge?
28819,L207233,u901,m59,BRAD,It's the first door on your left!
28820,L207232,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"I can't find it, mon!"
28821,L207231,u901,m59,BRAD,It's the first door on your left.
28822,L207230,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Totally.
28823,L207229,u901,m59,BRAD,Go ahead. Just make it quick.
28824,L206458,u901,m59,BRAD,"Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?"
28825,L206457,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Something happened to them, mon."
28826,L207049,u908,m59,HAROLD,"Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton."
28827,L207048,u901,m59,BRAD,You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
28828,L207047,u908,m59,HAROLD,"Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!"
28829,L207046,u901,m59,BRAD,I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
28830,L207045,u908,m59,HAROLD,But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
28831,L207044,u901,m59,BRAD,This is how I dress all the time.
28832,L207043,u908,m59,HAROLD,"Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?"
28833,L206781,u902,m59,BUSINESSMAN,Manager!!
28834,L206780,u901,m59,BRAD,"Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass."
28835,L206779,u902,m59,BUSINESSMAN,I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
28836,L206778,u901,m59,BRAD,"I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here."
28837,L206777,u902,m59,BUSINESSMAN,"Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?"
28838,L206776,u901,m59,BRAD,I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
28839,L206775,u902,m59,BUSINESSMAN,See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
28840,L206774,u901,m59,BRAD,"Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too..."
28841,L206773,u902,m59,BUSINESSMAN,No. I want my money back right now.
28842,L206772,u901,m59,BRAD,"Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here."
28843,L207201,u901,m59,BRAD,"All right, then. It's your secret."
28844,L207200,u915,m59,STACY,No.
28845,L207199,u901,m59,BRAD,"You're not going to tell me, are you?"
28846,L207197,u915,m59,STACY,Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
28847,L207196,u901,m59,BRAD,Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
28848,L207183,u915,m59,STACY,"Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it."
28849,L207182,u901,m59,BRAD,See you later.
28850,L207181,u915,m59,STACY,Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
28851,L206999,u915,m59,STACY,It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
28852,L206998,u901,m59,BRAD,Does Mom know you have company?
28853,L206694,u901,m59,BRAD,Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
28854,L206693,u915,m59,STACY,Maybe yes. Maybe no.
28855,L206692,u901,m59,BRAD,Are you still a virgin?
28856,L206691,u915,m59,STACY,But your face did!
28857,L206690,u901,m59,BRAD,I didn't say that.
28858,L206689,u915,m59,STACY,You are a virgin!
28859,L206688,u901,m59,BRAD,Maybe yes. Maybe no.
28860,L206687,u915,m59,STACY,I don't know. I was just curious.
28861,L206686,u901,m59,BRAD,Why?
28862,L206685,u915,m59,STACY,"Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?"
28863,L206684,u901,m59,BRAD,Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
28864,L206683,u915,m59,STACY,"Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa."
28865,L206682,u901,m59,BRAD,Well... it's true.
28866,L206681,u915,m59,STACY,I'm just guessing.
28867,L206680,u901,m59,BRAD,Where did you hear that?
28868,L206679,u915,m59,STACY,Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
28869,L206678,u901,m59,BRAD,"I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom."
28870,L206677,u915,m59,STACY,"You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?"
28871,L206676,u901,m59,BRAD,Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
28872,L206675,u915,m59,STACY,Is everything okay at work?
28873,L206674,u901,m59,BRAD,I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
28874,L206673,u915,m59,STACY,It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
28875,L206672,u901,m59,BRAD,Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
28876,L206671,u915,m59,STACY,Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
28877,L206633,u915,m59,STACY,I'll explain everything later.
28878,L206632,u901,m59,BRAD,I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
28879,L206631,u915,m59,STACY,"Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?"
28880,L206630,u901,m59,BRAD,They're not home yet.
28881,L206629,u915,m59,STACY,Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
28882,L206628,u915,m59,STACY,Don't strain yourself.
28883,L206627,u901,m59,BRAD,I take out the garbage.
28884,L206626,u915,m59,STACY,Your friends use the pool too.
28885,L206625,u901,m59,BRAD,Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
28886,L206624,u915,m59,STACY,Why can't you do it?
28887,L206623,u901,m59,BRAD,Mom says to clean up the pool.
28888,L206509,u901,m59,BRAD,Hey-yo.
28889,L206508,u915,m59,STACY,U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
28890,L206507,u901,m59,BRAD,Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
28891,L206504,u901,m59,BRAD,Sis.
28892,L206503,u915,m59,STACY,"Hi, Brad."
28893,L206789,u905,m59,DENNIS,You're fired.
28894,L206788,u901,m59,BRAD,"Yes, sir."
28895,L206787,u905,m59,DENNIS,Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
28896,L206786,u901,m59,BRAD,He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
28897,L206785,u905,m59,DENNIS,Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
28898,L206768,u901,m59,BRAD,"Okay, Dennis."
28899,L206767,u905,m59,DENNIS,Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
28900,L206464,u901,m59,BRAD,But they weren't mine.
28901,L206463,u905,m59,DENNIS,"Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good."
28902,L206462,u901,m59,BRAD,They were left over from the last shift.
28903,L206461,u905,m59,DENNIS,"Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?"
28904,L206460,u901,m59,BRAD,"No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis."
28905,L206459,u905,m59,DENNIS,Any problems?
28906,L207263,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you."
28907,L207262,u903,m59,CURTIS,Jeff you have company!
28908,L206819,u903,m59,CURTIS,Dad says!
28909,L206818,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Leave me alone.
28910,L206817,u903,m59,CURTIS,"Dad says you're late again, you butthole!"
28911,L206816,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Leave me alone!
28912,L206815,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Ugh.
28913,L206814,u903,m59,CURTIS,Dad says you have to get up!
28914,L207259,u915,m59,STACY,Get going.
28915,L207258,u904,m59,DAMONE,All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
28916,L207257,u915,m59,STACY,Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
28917,L207170,u904,m59,DAMONE,"Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay."
28918,L207169,u915,m59,STACY,Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
28919,L207168,u904,m59,DAMONE,Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
28920,L207167,u915,m59,STACY,"It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic."
28921,L207166,u904,m59,DAMONE,Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
28922,L207165,u915,m59,STACY,We've got to get an abortion?
28923,L207164,u904,m59,DAMONE,There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
28924,L207163,u904,m59,DAMONE,"All right, I take it back."
28925,L207162,u915,m59,STACY,Take that back.
28926,L207160,u915,m59,STACY,I know it's yours.
28927,L207159,u904,m59,DAMONE,How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
28928,L207158,u915,m59,STACY,Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
28929,L207157,u904,m59,DAMONE,Why don't you call me up tonight?
28930,L207156,u904,m59,DAMONE,What? Now?
28931,L207155,u915,m59,STACY,"Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it."
28932,L207154,u904,m59,DAMONE,What's going on?
28933,L207115,u904,m59,DAMONE,Hello.
28934,L207114,u915,m59,STACY,I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
28935,L207113,u904,m59,DAMONE,"Look, I'm kind of in a hurry."
28936,L207112,u915,m59,STACY,I didn't see you this morning.
28937,L207111,u904,m59,DAMONE,Oh. Hi.
28938,L207092,u915,m59,STACY,I guess I did.
28939,L207091,u904,m59,DAMONE,I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
28940,L207090,u915,m59,STACY,What's wrong?
28941,L207089,u904,m59,DAMONE,I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
28942,L207088,u915,m59,STACY,I think we're making a lot of noise.
28943,L207087,u904,m59,DAMONE,What? Are you all right?
28944,L207086,u915,m59,STACY,"Hey, Mike?"
28945,L207085,u904,m59,DAMONE,Let's continue.
28946,L207084,u915,m59,STACY,I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
28947,L207083,u915,m59,STACY,How about both of us at the same time?
28948,L207082,u904,m59,DAMONE,You first.
28949,L207081,u915,m59,STACY,"Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?"
28950,L207080,u904,m59,DAMONE,No. Are you crazy?
28951,L207079,u915,m59,STACY,So are you.  Are you shaking?
28952,L207078,u904,m59,DAMONE,You're a really good kisser.
28953,L207077,u915,m59,STACY,"He's my friend, too."
28954,L207076,u904,m59,DAMONE,"Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend."
28955,L207074,u904,m59,DAMONE,Come on...
28956,L207073,u915,m59,STACY,Are you really a virgin?
28957,L207072,u904,m59,DAMONE,I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
28958,L207071,u915,m59,STACY,Pick a suit.
28959,L207067,u915,m59,STACY,Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
28960,L207066,u904,m59,DAMONE,Well...
28961,L207065,u915,m59,STACY,Do you want to take a quick swim?
28962,L207064,u904,m59,DAMONE,I know what I look like.
28963,L207063,u915,m59,STACY,Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
28964,L207062,u904,m59,DAMONE,I don't know.
28965,L207061,u915,m59,STACY,I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
28966,L207060,u915,m59,STACY,Sure. Come on in.
28967,L207059,u904,m59,DAMONE,Do you have any ice tea?
28968,L207056,u915,m59,STACY,Mark is a really nice boy...
28969,L207055,u904,m59,DAMONE,You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
28970,L207054,u904,m59,DAMONE,What a guy.
28971,L207053,u915,m59,STACY,"Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself."
28972,L207052,u904,m59,DAMONE,Get a ride with somebody.
28973,L207051,u915,m59,STACY,I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
28974,L206996,u915,m59,STACY,"O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?"
28975,L206995,u904,m59,DAMONE,"Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi."
28976,L206989,u915,m59,STACY,"Oh, really?"
28977,L206988,u904,m59,DAMONE,Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
28978,L206899,u915,m59,STACY,Nice to meet you.
28979,L206898,u904,m59,DAMONE,"Nice to meet you, Stacy."
28980,L207356,u916,m59,THE RAT,"It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond."
28981,L207355,u904,m59,DAMONE,"Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too."
28982,L207354,u916,m59,THE RAT,Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
28983,L207353,u904,m59,DAMONE,What do you read? What's the last book you read?
28984,L207352,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people."
28985,L207351,u904,m59,DAMONE,So what makes you so sensitive?
28986,L207350,u916,m59,THE RAT,Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
28987,L207349,u904,m59,DAMONE,Sensitive -- what is that?
28988,L207348,u916,m59,THE RAT,And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
28989,L207347,u904,m59,DAMONE,"Whatever you say, Rat."
28990,L207346,u916,m59,THE RAT,"The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl."
28991,L207308,u904,m59,DAMONE,You're crazy. Those girls love me.
28992,L207307,u916,m59,THE RAT,"You're losing it, Damone."
28993,L207222,u904,m59,DAMONE,Fine. Get lost.
28994,L207221,u916,m59,THE RAT,"I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out."
28995,L207220,u904,m59,DAMONE,Jesus. I'm sorry.
28996,L207219,u916,m59,THE RAT,Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
28997,L207218,u904,m59,DAMONE,She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
28998,L207217,u916,m59,THE RAT,No Damone. I don't understand.
28999,L207216,u904,m59,DAMONE,"If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?"
29000,L207010,u916,m59,THE RAT,Chicken!
29001,L207009,u904,m59,DAMONE,No. I don't think so. Not right now.
29002,L207006,u916,m59,THE RAT,Really.
29003,L207005,u904,m59,DAMONE,Poor guy.
29004,L206897,u916,m59,THE RAT,Okay. See ya.
29005,L206896,u904,m59,DAMONE,"Well, I've gotta be running."
29006,L206895,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone."
29007,L206894,u904,m59,DAMONE,"I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?"
29008,L206893,u916,m59,THE RAT,Damone! You come here?
29009,L206892,u904,m59,DAMONE,"Hey, Mark. Is that you?"
29010,L206885,u904,m59,DAMONE,I'm really pretty busy...
29011,L206884,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Damone, are you there?"
29012,L206883,u916,m59,THE RAT,"No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?"
29013,L206882,u904,m59,DAMONE,Did you go home and get it?
29014,L206881,u916,m59,THE RAT,It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
29015,L206880,u904,m59,DAMONE,Mark. What happened to your date?
29016,L206879,u916,m59,THE RAT,Damone. It's Mark.
29017,L206878,u904,m59,DAMONE,Yo.
29018,L206856,u904,m59,DAMONE,You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
29019,L206855,u916,m59,THE RAT,"I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her."
29020,L206854,u904,m59,DAMONE,"And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss."
29021,L206850,u904,m59,DAMONE,All right. Pay attention.
29022,L206849,u916,m59,THE RAT,Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
29023,L206848,u904,m59,DAMONE,What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
29024,L206847,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Knock it off, Damone. I need real help."
29025,L206750,u904,m59,DAMONE,Ace the jacket.
29026,L206749,u916,m59,THE RAT,Yeah?
29027,L206748,u904,m59,DAMONE,"Hey, Rat."
29028,L206737,u904,m59,DAMONE,There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
29029,L206736,u916,m59,THE RAT,I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
29030,L206735,u904,m59,DAMONE,"The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith."
29031,L206658,u916,m59,THE RAT,"The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude."
29032,L206657,u904,m59,DAMONE,"That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude."
29033,L206656,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen."
29034,L206655,u904,m59,DAMONE,Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
29035,L206653,u904,m59,DAMONE,Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
29036,L206652,u916,m59,THE RAT,"You tell me, Mike. What do I do?"
29037,L206651,u904,m59,DAMONE,I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
29038,L206650,u916,m59,THE RAT,Really?
29039,L206649,u904,m59,DAMONE,I would. Yeah.
29040,L206648,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'"
29041,L206647,u904,m59,DAMONE,It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
29042,L206646,u916,m59,THE RAT,No. It's too soon.
29043,L206645,u904,m59,DAMONE,Did you get her name?
29044,L206644,u916,m59,THE RAT,No.
29045,L206643,u904,m59,DAMONE,Did you get her number?
29046,L206642,u916,m59,THE RAT,She's in my biology class.
29047,L206641,u904,m59,DAMONE,All right... where did you see her?
29048,L206640,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Damone, you gotta listen to me."
29049,L206639,u904,m59,DAMONE,It's definitely your mama.
29050,L206638,u916,m59,THE RAT,What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
29051,L206637,u904,m59,DAMONE,You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
29052,L206438,u904,m59,DAMONE,You should work for yourself.
29053,L206437,u916,m59,THE RAT,Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
29054,L206486,u910,m59,LINDA,And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
29055,L206485,u906,m59,GIRL,"Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda."
29056,L206484,u910,m59,LINDA,Not if you're over sixteen.
29057,L206483,u906,m59,GIRL,And they don't call my parents?
29058,L206482,u910,m59,LINDA,"All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's."
29059,L206479,u906,m59,GIRL,I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
29060,L206478,u910,m59,LINDA,Yes.
29061,L206477,u906,m59,GIRL,Are you Linda Barrett?
29062,L206813,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards."
29063,L206812,u907,m59,GRIFFIN,"What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?"
29064,L206811,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Totally.
29065,L206810,u907,m59,GRIFFIN,Are you going to ride that wave?
29066,L206809,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"That's me, Merv."
29067,L206808,u907,m59,GRIFFIN,Who's that?
29068,L206807,u907,m59,GRIFFIN,Fascinating.
29069,L206806,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning."
29070,L206805,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?"
29071,L206804,u907,m59,GRIFFIN,I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
29072,L206803,u914,m59,SPICOLI,I don't go at all.
29073,L206802,u907,m59,GRIFFIN,How often do you go?
29074,L206801,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time."
29075,L206800,u907,m59,GRIFFIN,"I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could..."
29076,L206799,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains."
29077,L206798,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"I've been swimming, Merv."
29078,L206797,u907,m59,GRIFFIN,I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
29079,L206796,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great."
29080,L206795,u907,m59,GRIFFIN,How've you been?
29081,L207331,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but..."
29082,L207330,u909,m59,L.C.,That's him! He did it!
29083,L206959,u909,m59,L.C.,"You can't fix this car, Spicoli."
29084,L206958,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car."
29085,L206957,u909,m59,L.C.,First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
29086,L206956,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?"
29087,L206955,u909,m59,L.C.,My brother is gonna shit.
29088,L206954,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Just be glad you're all right.
29089,L206953,u909,m59,L.C.,My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
29090,L206949,u914,m59,SPICOLI,You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
29091,L206948,u909,m59,L.C.,We just missed the turnoff to the party.
29092,L206946,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"All right. Die, Granada Jocks!"
29093,L206945,u909,m59,L.C.,My brother's car!
29094,L206944,u909,m59,L.C.,They're fuckin' with us.
29095,L206943,u914,m59,SPICOLI,It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
29096,L206941,u909,m59,L.C.,This ain't no cop.
29097,L206940,u914,m59,SPICOLI,What the fuck is this guy doing?
29098,L206936,u909,m59,L.C.,I like sex.
29099,L206935,u914,m59,SPICOLI,All right.
29100,L206934,u909,m59,L.C.,Suzanne Somers' tits.
29101,L206933,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Naw. Any good?
29102,L206932,u909,m59,L.C.,Seen the new Playboy?
29103,L206931,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Then don't hassle it.
29104,L206930,u909,m59,L.C.,He is.
29105,L206929,u914,m59,SPICOLI,I thought he was out of town.
29106,L206928,u909,m59,L.C.,"Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car."
29107,L207305,u915,m59,STACY,Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
29108,L207304,u910,m59,LINDA,There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
29109,L207303,u915,m59,STACY,I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
29110,L207302,u910,m59,LINDA,I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
29111,L207301,u915,m59,STACY,Dartmouth?!
29112,L207300,u910,m59,LINDA,Well I might go to Dartmouth.
29113,L207299,u915,m59,STACY,But what are you going to do?
29114,L207298,u910,m59,LINDA,"Yeah, like maybe never."
29115,L207297,u915,m59,STACY,Sometime?
29116,L207296,u910,m59,LINDA,He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
29117,L207295,u915,m59,STACY,Not coming? What happened?
29118,L207294,u910,m59,LINDA,He's not coming.
29119,L207293,u915,m59,STACY,Where's Doug?
29120,L207256,u910,m59,LINDA,Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
29121,L207255,u915,m59,STACY,I want romance.
29122,L207254,u910,m59,LINDA,What do you want?
29123,L207253,u915,m59,STACY,"You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex."
29124,L207252,u910,m59,LINDA,Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
29125,L207251,u915,m59,STACY,Another summer of working at Swenson's.
29126,L207209,u910,m59,LINDA,"Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!"
29127,L207208,u915,m59,STACY,"Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy."
29128,L207207,u910,m59,LINDA,There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
29129,L207206,u915,m59,STACY,I paid for it and everything.
29130,L207205,u910,m59,LINDA,That little prick.
29131,L207204,u915,m59,STACY,"Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father."
29132,L207203,u910,m59,LINDA,That little prick.
29133,L207202,u915,m59,STACY,I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
29134,L207153,u910,m59,LINDA,You're right. I didn't tell you that.
29135,L207152,u915,m59,STACY,"You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old."
29136,L207151,u910,m59,LINDA,What?
29137,L207150,u915,m59,STACY,"You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys."
29138,L207149,u910,m59,LINDA,But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
29139,L207148,u915,m59,STACY,I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
29140,L207147,u910,m59,LINDA,"Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!"
29141,L207146,u915,m59,STACY,It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
29142,L207145,u910,m59,LINDA,It couldn't be.
29143,L207144,u915,m59,STACY,What do you think it is?
29144,L207143,u910,m59,LINDA,What do you think it is?
29145,L207142,u915,m59,STACY,I don't know... I just don't feel right.
29146,L207141,u910,m59,LINDA,You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
29147,L207140,u915,m59,STACY,"I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing."
29148,L207139,u910,m59,LINDA,"God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban."
29149,L207012,u915,m59,STACY,"God, I don't think so. Better look in the house."
29150,L207011,u910,m59,LINDA,Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
29151,L207004,u915,m59,STACY,I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
29152,L207003,u910,m59,LINDA,"God, he hardly even talks anymore."
29153,L206994,u910,m59,LINDA,No.
29154,L206993,u915,m59,STACY,"I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?"
29155,L206992,u910,m59,LINDA,I think they're both virgins.
29156,L206991,u915,m59,STACY,What do you think?
29157,L206986,u910,m59,LINDA,He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
29158,L206985,u915,m59,STACY,What's Doug do in Chicago?
29159,L206984,u910,m59,LINDA,I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
29160,L206983,u915,m59,STACY,How long does Doug take?
29161,L206981,u915,m59,STACY,"Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'"
29162,L206980,u910,m59,LINDA,No. But it's a nice idea.
29163,L206979,u915,m59,STACY,Does that ever happen?
29164,L206978,u910,m59,LINDA,Climax together.
29165,L206977,u915,m59,STACY,"All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'"
29166,L206976,u910,m59,LINDA,"You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck."
29167,L206975,u915,m59,STACY,Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
29168,L206974,u910,m59,LINDA,"Okay, penis, that's one, balls..."
29169,L206973,u915,m59,STACY,Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
29170,L206972,u910,m59,LINDA,Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
29171,L206971,u915,m59,STACY,"You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school."
29172,L206970,u910,m59,LINDA,I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
29173,L206837,u915,m59,STACY,Sixteen.
29174,L206836,u910,m59,LINDA,"Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?"
29175,L206835,u915,m59,STACY,"What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner."
29176,L206733,u915,m59,STACY,Thanks a lot.
29177,L206732,u910,m59,LINDA,Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
29178,L206731,u915,m59,STACY,I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
29179,L206730,u910,m59,LINDA,"Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on."
29180,L206729,u915,m59,STACY,Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
29181,L206727,u915,m59,STACY,Not since November.
29182,L206726,u910,m59,LINDA,I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
29183,L206725,u915,m59,STACY,I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
29184,L206724,u910,m59,LINDA,You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
29185,L206700,u910,m59,LINDA,Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
29186,L206699,u915,m59,STACY,If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
29187,L206698,u910,m59,LINDA,Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
29188,L206697,u915,m59,STACY,Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
29189,L206696,u910,m59,LINDA,"Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again."
29190,L206695,u915,m59,STACY,"There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen."
29191,L206622,u910,m59,LINDA,Hey! That's my line!
29192,L206621,u915,m59,STACY,"Come on, Linda. It's just sex."
29193,L206620,u910,m59,LINDA,"So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?"
29194,L206619,u915,m59,STACY,It was nice.
29195,L206618,u910,m59,LINDA,You'll always remember your first time.
29196,L206617,u915,m59,STACY,It was okay.
29197,L206616,u910,m59,LINDA,Was it great?
29198,L206583,u915,m59,STACY,Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
29199,L206582,u910,m59,LINDA,Just kidding. About 10cc.
29200,L206579,u910,m59,LINDA,There's nothing to it.
29201,L206578,u915,m59,STACY,Well I never did it.
29202,L206577,u910,m59,LINDA,What's the big deal?
29203,L206576,u915,m59,STACY,"Like, you know, giving blow jobs."
29204,L206575,u910,m59,LINDA,What variables?
29205,L206574,u915,m59,STACY,"No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at."
29206,L206573,u910,m59,LINDA,What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
29207,L206572,u915,m59,STACY,Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
29208,L206571,u910,m59,LINDA,"Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them."
29209,L206570,u915,m59,STACY,Do you think guys find that attractive?
29210,L206567,u910,m59,LINDA,I know.
29211,L206566,u915,m59,STACY,Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
29212,L206561,u910,m59,LINDA,God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
29213,L206560,u915,m59,STACY,No way! He just called him a dick.
29214,L206559,u910,m59,LINDA,I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
29215,L206488,u910,m59,LINDA,Believe it.
29216,L206487,u915,m59,STACY,I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
29217,L206476,u910,m59,LINDA,"If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it."
29218,L206475,u915,m59,STACY,"He was hot, wasn't he?"
29219,L206474,u910,m59,LINDA,"Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will."
29220,L206473,u915,m59,STACY,Really?
29221,L206472,u910,m59,LINDA,Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
29222,L206471,u915,m59,STACY,I can't do that.
29223,L206470,u910,m59,LINDA,"I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him."
29224,L206469,u915,m59,STACY,So what did you do?
29225,L206468,u910,m59,LINDA,"Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call."
29226,L206467,u915,m59,STACY,"Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?"
29227,L206466,u910,m59,LINDA,Should we buy a frame for that?
29228,L206465,u915,m59,STACY,"He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'"
29229,L206431,u910,m59,LINDA,"Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot."
29230,L206430,u915,m59,STACY,What should I do?
29231,L206429,u910,m59,LINDA,"Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man."
29232,L206428,u915,m59,STACY,"Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really."
29233,L206427,u910,m59,LINDA,Don't you like him?
29234,L206424,u915,m59,STACY,Do you think that guy's cute?
29235,L206423,u910,m59,LINDA,How's it going.
29236,L207292,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Aloha, Spicoli."
29237,L207291,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Aloha, Mr. Hand!"
29238,L207290,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"All right! Oh, yeah!"
29239,L207289,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by."
29240,L207288,u914,m59,SPICOLI,You're gonna flunk me?!
29241,L207287,u912,m59,MR. HAND,If you graduate.
29242,L207286,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building."
29243,L207285,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Well, you'll find out next year."
29244,L207284,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?"
29245,L207283,u912,m59,MR. HAND,What's that?
29246,L207282,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?"
29247,L207281,u912,m59,MR. HAND,I think I've made my point with you tonight.
29248,L207278,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you."
29249,L207277,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand."
29250,L207276,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty."
29251,L207274,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson."
29252,L207273,u914,m59,SPICOLI,I don't know. I guess so.
29253,L207272,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Do you want to sit there, Jeff?"
29254,L207271,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?"
29255,L207270,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff."
29256,L207269,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
29257,L207268,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?"
29258,L207266,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?"
29259,L207265,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Mr... Mr. Hand.
29260,L207035,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week."
29261,L207034,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"You better save some for me, you swine!"
29262,L207030,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?"
29263,L207029,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time."
29264,L207028,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
29265,L207027,u912,m59,MR. HAND,Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
29266,L206718,u914,m59,SPICOLI,I don't know.
29267,L206717,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?"
29268,L206716,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever."
29269,L206715,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?"
29270,L206714,u914,m59,SPICOLI,I couldn't make it in time.
29271,L206713,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?"
29272,L206712,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
29273,L206534,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"Hey, bud. What's your problem?"
29274,L206533,u912,m59,MR. HAND,Yes.
29275,L206532,u914,m59,SPICOLI,You just ripped my card in two!
29276,L206531,u914,m59,SPICOLI,That's the name they gave me.
29277,L206530,u912,m59,MR. HAND,Mr. Spicoli?
29278,L206528,u912,m59,MR. HAND,"Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here."
29279,L206527,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Can I come in?
29280,L206526,u912,m59,MR. HAND,Really?
29281,L206525,u914,m59,SPICOLI,"This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window."
29282,L206524,u912,m59,MR. HAND,What class?
29283,L206523,u914,m59,SPICOLI,Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
29284,L206615,u915,m59,STACY,Yes.
29285,L206614,u913,m59,RON,Is this your first time?
29286,L206613,u913,m59,RON,No. I mean back to your home.
29287,L206612,u915,m59,STACY,What about those other guys you live with?
29288,L206611,u913,m59,RON,I think I better take you home.
29289,L206610,u915,m59,STACY,Yes... I am really nineteen.
29290,L206609,u913,m59,RON,Are you really nineteen?
29291,L206608,u915,m59,STACY,It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
29292,L206607,u913,m59,RON,It's very warm out tonight.
29293,L206606,u913,m59,RON,Thanks. Thanks a lot.
29294,L206605,u915,m59,STACY,That's a nice shirt.
29295,L206604,u913,m59,RON,"All right, the point it is."
29296,L206603,u915,m59,STACY,The point sounds fine.
29297,L206602,u913,m59,RON,How about the point?
29298,L206601,u915,m59,STACY,I don't know. Wherever you want.
29299,L206600,u913,m59,RON,Where do you feel like going?
29300,L206599,u915,m59,STACY,Thanks. So do you.
29301,L206598,u913,m59,RON,"'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight."
29302,L206597,u913,m59,RON,No problem.
29303,L206596,u915,m59,STACY,Thanks for picking me up.
29304,L206436,u913,m59,RON,How about your phone number?
29305,L206435,u915,m59,STACY,What can I get for you tonight.
29306,L206434,u915,m59,STACY,"I know, everyone says that."
29307,L206433,u913,m59,RON,You look like you could still be in high school.
29308,L207343,u915,m59,STACY,I'd like that.
29309,L207342,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime."
29310,L207341,u915,m59,STACY,"Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer."
29311,L207340,u916,m59,THE RAT,Really?
29312,L207339,u915,m59,STACY,"I know everybody says it, but I really mean it."
29313,L207338,u916,m59,THE RAT,Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
29314,L207337,u915,m59,STACY,"I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year."
29315,L207336,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Hi, Stacy. How are you?"
29316,L207335,u915,m59,STACY,"Hi, Mark."
29317,L207134,u916,m59,THE RAT,I'll get you the notes.
29318,L207133,u915,m59,STACY,What about the notes?
29319,L207132,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in."
29320,L207131,u915,m59,STACY,I made a fool of myself.
29321,L207100,u915,m59,STACY,Oh. I see.
29322,L207099,u916,m59,THE RAT,John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
29323,L207098,u915,m59,STACY,John Bonham?
29324,L207097,u916,m59,THE RAT,It's John Bonham's birthday.
29325,L207096,u915,m59,STACY,What's April 16th?
29326,L207095,u916,m59,THE RAT,Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
29327,L207094,u915,m59,STACY,Where's Mike today?
29328,L206925,u916,m59,THE RAT,Well... it's getting kind of late.
29329,L206924,u915,m59,STACY,Do you really have to go?
29330,L206923,u916,m59,THE RAT,...I've got to go home.
29331,L206921,u916,m59,THE RAT,"Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan."
29332,L206920,u915,m59,STACY,This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
29333,L206919,u916,m59,THE RAT,Sure.
29334,L206918,u915,m59,STACY,"Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?"
29335,L206917,u916,m59,THE RAT,I don't know.
29336,L206916,u915,m59,STACY,Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
29337,L206915,u916,m59,THE RAT,So... pretty nice house you've got here.
29338,L206911,u916,m59,THE RAT,Naw. I don't mind.
29339,L206910,u915,m59,STACY,"Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind."
29340,L206909,u916,m59,THE RAT,No. That's okay.
29341,L206908,u915,m59,STACY,I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
29342,L206907,u916,m59,THE RAT,Where's your brother?
29343,L206906,u916,m59,THE RAT,Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
29344,L206905,u915,m59,STACY,"No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house."
29345,L206904,u916,m59,THE RAT,Aren't your parents asleep?
29346,L206903,u915,m59,STACY,Do you want to come inside?
29347,L206902,u916,m59,THE RAT,I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
29348,L206901,u915,m59,STACY,"Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck."
29349,L206900,u916,m59,THE RAT,I had a really nice time tonight.
29350,L206890,u916,m59,THE RAT,Two more Cokes.
29351,L206889,u915,m59,STACY,Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
29352,L206872,u915,m59,STACY,Not at all.
29353,L206871,u916,m59,THE RAT,Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
29354,L206870,u916,m59,THE RAT,Oh yeah.
29355,L206869,u915,m59,STACY,Are you all right?
29356,L206868,u916,m59,THE RAT,Excellent.
29357,L206867,u915,m59,STACY,I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
29358,L206866,u916,m59,THE RAT,Do you know what you want?
29359,L206865,u915,m59,STACY,"I've heard that, too."
29360,L206864,u916,m59,THE RAT,Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
29361,L206863,u915,m59,STACY,Yeah. She is pretty good.
29362,L206862,u916,m59,THE RAT,Yeah. She is pretty good.
29363,L206861,u915,m59,STACY,Do you have Mrs. George for English?
29364,L206860,u916,m59,THE RAT,Yeah. It's my sister's.
29365,L206859,u915,m59,STACY,This is a nice car.
29366,L206858,u916,m59,THE RAT,Sure thing.
29367,L206857,u915,m59,STACY,Thanks for coming to get me.
29368,L206762,u916,m59,THE RAT,Oh... yes.
29369,L206761,u915,m59,STACY,Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
29370,L206760,u916,m59,THE RAT,My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
29371,L206759,u915,m59,STACY,What's your other question?
29372,L206756,u915,m59,STACY,"We keep them, in case the people come back."
29373,L206755,u916,m59,THE RAT,You keep them.
29374,L206754,u915,m59,STACY,We keep them.
29375,L206753,u916,m59,THE RAT,What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
29376,L206888,u916,m59,THE RAT,"I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?"
29377,L206887,u917,m59,WAITRESS,Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
29378,L206877,u917,m59,WAITRESS,Okay. Thanks.
29379,L206876,u916,m59,THE RAT,Two Cokes.
29380,L206875,u917,m59,WAITRESS,Anything to drink?
29381,L206874,u916,m59,THE RAT,Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
29382,L206873,u917,m59,WAITRESS,Are you ready to order here?
29383,L208900,u920,m60,DUKE,Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
29384,L208899,u918,m60,CLERK,"What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?"
29385,L208898,u920,m60,DUKE,Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
29386,L208897,u918,m60,CLERK,"Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police..."
29387,L208896,u920,m60,DUKE,"Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over."
29388,L208895,u918,m60,CLERK,"Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention..."
29389,L208894,u920,m60,DUKE,Crying? Why was she crying?
29390,L208893,u918,m60,CLERK,The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
29391,L208892,u920,m60,DUKE,Tell me. What do you want?
29392,L208891,u918,m60,CLERK,Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
29393,L208890,u920,m60,DUKE,IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
29394,L208889,u918,m60,CLERK,Killed?
29395,L208888,u920,m60,DUKE,"WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!"
29396,L208887,u918,m60,CLERK,"Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering..."
29397,L208884,u920,m60,DUKE,Holy shit!
29398,L208883,u918,m60,CLERK,"Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: ""Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."""
29399,L208882,u920,m60,DUKE,What's the message? My light is blinking.
29400,L208750,u920,m60,DUKE,"Well, thank you."
29401,L208749,u918,m60,CLERK,"Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay."
29402,L208748,u920,m60,DUKE,"Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?"
29403,L208747,u920,m60,DUKE,My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
29404,L208746,u918,m60,CLERK,"Certainly, Mr. Duke!"
29405,L208744,u918,m60,CLERK,"Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. ""Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."""
29406,L208743,u920,m60,DUKE,"Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying..."
29407,L208692,u920,m60,DUKE,Righto!
29408,L208691,u918,m60,CLERK,Let's have lunch!
29409,L208690,u920,m60,DUKE,Not for me.
29410,L208689,u918,m60,CLERK,There's no hurry! The race is over!
29411,L208688,u920,m60,DUKE,"Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track."
29412,L208687,u918,m60,CLERK,But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
29413,L208686,u920,m60,DUKE,"Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man."
29414,L208685,u918,m60,CLERK,"Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand."
29415,L208684,u920,m60,DUKE,Awake? What do you mean?
29416,L208683,u918,m60,CLERK,Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
29417,L208682,u920,m60,DUKE,You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
29418,L208681,u918,m60,CLERK,What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
29419,L208680,u920,m60,DUKE,"He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him."
29420,L208679,u918,m60,CLERK,I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
29421,L208678,u920,m60,DUKE,Yes... It makes sense.
29422,L208677,u918,m60,CLERK,"Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?"
29423,L208877,u919,m60,DA,What?
29424,L208876,u920,m60,DUKE,Dobermans don't talk.
29425,L208875,u919,m60,DA,"Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it."
29426,L208872,u919,m60,DA,WHAT?
29427,L208871,u920,m60,DUKE,Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
29428,L208847,u920,m60,DUKE,Naked.
29429,L208846,u919,m60,DA,Naked!?
29430,L208836,u920,m60,DUKE,Not where we operate.
29431,L208835,u919,m60,DA,Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
29432,L208832,u919,m60,DA,"Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!"
29433,L208831,u920,m60,DUKE,"They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft."
29434,L208830,u919,m60,DA,You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
29435,L208829,u920,m60,DUKE,"Rum and ice, please."
29436,L208870,u921,m60,GONZO,You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
29437,L208869,u919,m60,DA,What do you mean by that?
29438,L208868,u921,m60,GONZO,You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
29439,L208867,u919,m60,DA,"Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe."
29440,L208857,u921,m60,GONZO,That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
29441,L208856,u919,m60,DA,Really?
29442,L208855,u921,m60,GONZO,He wanted the pineal gland.
29443,L208854,u919,m60,DA,Naw! Not a major.
29444,L208853,u921,m60,GONZO,"We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house."
29445,L208852,u919,m60,DA,A major!
29446,L208851,u921,m60,GONZO,Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
29447,L208841,u919,m60,DA,And nobody did anything?
29448,L208840,u921,m60,GONZO,"Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!"
29449,L208839,u919,m60,DA,What happened? What did they do to her?
29450,L208828,u919,m60,DA,Not down in my parts.
29451,L208827,u921,m60,GONZO,They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
29452,L208826,u919,m60,DA,Naw!
29453,L208825,u921,m60,GONZO,You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
29454,L208824,u919,m60,DA,I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
29455,L209098,u920,m60,DUKE,Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just another good American like yourself.
29456,L209097,u925,m60,PROPRIETOR,This is my granddaughter...
29457,L209096,u920,m60,DUKE,"Oh, my God!..."
29458,L209095,u925,m60,PROPRIETOR,That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
29459,L209094,u920,m60,DUKE,I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
29460,L209093,u925,m60,PROPRIETOR,"A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type."
29461,L209092,u920,m60,DUKE,Las Vegas.
29462,L209091,u925,m60,PROPRIETOR,"Where ya comin' from, young man?"
29463,L208400,u920,m60,DUKE,Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
29464,L208399,u923,m60,HITCHHIKER,Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
29465,L208353,u920,m60,DUKE,Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
29466,L208352,u923,m60,HITCHHIKER,What?
29467,L208351,u920,m60,DUKE,"I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?"
29468,L208350,u923,m60,HITCHHIKER,"Hell, no!"
29469,L208349,u920,m60,DUKE,"I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?"
29470,L209077,u921,m60,GONZO,Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
29471,L209076,u920,m60,DUKE,"Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People."
29472,L209074,u921,m60,GONZO,"Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!"
29473,L209073,u920,m60,DUKE,"Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?"
29474,L209072,u921,m60,GONZO,No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
29475,L209070,u920,m60,DUKE,Never missed a plane yet.
29476,L209069,u921,m60,GONZO,The airport is over there!
29477,L209066,u920,m60,DUKE,"We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it."
29478,L209065,u921,m60,GONZO,What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
29479,L209059,u920,m60,DUKE,"Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level."
29480,L209058,u921,m60,GONZO,How much is the lemon meringue pie?
29481,L209057,u920,m60,DUKE,I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
29482,L209044,u921,m60,GONZO,Two glasses of ice water with ice.
29483,L209043,u920,m60,DUKE,There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
29484,L208999,u920,m60,DUKE,Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
29485,L208998,u921,m60,GONZO,Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
29486,L208983,u920,m60,DUKE,Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
29487,L208982,u921,m60,GONZO,"Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician."
29488,L208976,u920,m60,DUKE,Do you think you can handle it?
29489,L208975,u921,m60,GONZO,I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
29490,L208974,u920,m60,DUKE,"So do we, lady."
29491,L208941,u920,m60,DUKE,FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
29492,L208940,u921,m60,GONZO,Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
29493,L208936,u921,m60,GONZO,...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
29494,L208935,u920,m60,DUKE,Yes!
29495,L208934,u921,m60,GONZO,...grow claws... bleeding warts.
29496,L208933,u920,m60,DUKE,Right!
29497,L208932,u921,m60,GONZO,"Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours..."
29498,L208931,u921,m60,GONZO,Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
29499,L208930,u920,m60,DUKE,Extract of pineal!
29500,L208929,u921,m60,GONZO,Some of what?
29501,L208928,u920,m60,DUKE,Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
29502,L208925,u920,m60,DUKE,"I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought..."
29503,L208924,u921,m60,GONZO,"I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on."
29504,L208923,u920,m60,DUKE,Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
29505,L208922,u921,m60,GONZO,"Never mind, it's absolutely pure."
29506,L208921,u920,m60,DUKE,Where'd you get this?
29507,L208920,u920,m60,DUKE,"I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again."
29508,L208917,u920,m60,DUKE,"I remember thinking, ""Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."""
29509,L208916,u921,m60,GONZO,"Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out..."
29510,L208915,u920,m60,DUKE,Adrenochrome...
29511,L208914,u921,m60,GONZO,"You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome."
29512,L208913,u920,m60,DUKE,What is this?
29513,L208912,u921,m60,GONZO,"Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit."
29514,L208911,u920,m60,DUKE,It's gone too far.
29515,L208910,u921,m60,GONZO,"OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem."
29516,L208905,u921,m60,GONZO,"She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?"
29517,L208904,u920,m60,DUKE,Me?
29518,L208903,u921,m60,GONZO,"No, she's looking for you."
29519,L208902,u920,m60,DUKE,Lucy is looking for you.
29520,L208901,u921,m60,GONZO,Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
29521,L208879,u920,m60,DUKE,They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
29522,L208878,u921,m60,GONZO,Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
29523,L208874,u920,m60,DUKE,We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
29524,L208873,u921,m60,GONZO,"Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line."
29525,L208866,u921,m60,GONZO,Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
29526,L208865,u920,m60,DUKE,"What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it."
29527,L208849,u920,m60,DUKE,They were all veterans.
29528,L208848,u921,m60,GONZO,"Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons."
29529,L208845,u921,m60,GONZO,...and every one of them stacked naked...
29530,L208844,u920,m60,DUKE,Like big lizards.
29531,L208843,u921,m60,GONZO,"They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up..."
29532,L208842,u920,m60,DUKE,"What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s."
29533,L208838,u920,m60,DUKE,"Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!"
29534,L208837,u921,m60,GONZO,"Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to."
29535,L208834,u920,m60,DUKE,"Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!"
29536,L208833,u921,m60,GONZO,Read the newspapers.
29537,L208804,u920,m60,DUKE,Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
29538,L208803,u921,m60,GONZO,This is a fucking nightmare.
29539,L208802,u920,m60,DUKE,Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
29540,L208801,u921,m60,GONZO,"Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!"
29541,L208800,u920,m60,DUKE,They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
29542,L208799,u921,m60,GONZO,"I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!"
29543,L208794,u921,m60,GONZO,Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
29544,L208793,u920,m60,DUKE,Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
29545,L208792,u921,m60,GONZO,"As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline."
29546,L208791,u920,m60,DUKE,That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
29547,L208790,u921,m60,GONZO,"I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out."
29548,L208787,u920,m60,DUKE,"I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done."
29549,L208786,u921,m60,GONZO,"Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra..."
29550,L208784,u920,m60,DUKE,Us?
29551,L208783,u921,m60,GONZO,"It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless."
29552,L208782,u920,m60,DUKE,What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
29553,L208781,u921,m60,GONZO,"We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in."
29554,L208780,u920,m60,DUKE,"The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney."
29555,L208778,u920,m60,DUKE,"You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go."
29556,L208777,u921,m60,GONZO,"NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!"
29557,L208776,u920,m60,DUKE,"In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member."
29558,L208775,u921,m60,GONZO,You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
29559,L208774,u920,m60,DUKE,"I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three."
29560,L208773,u921,m60,GONZO,NO! Stop talking like that.
29561,L208772,u920,m60,DUKE,"It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day."
29562,L208771,u921,m60,GONZO,Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
29563,L208770,u920,m60,DUKE,"She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own."
29564,L208769,u921,m60,GONZO,"Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible."
29565,L208768,u920,m60,DUKE,Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
29566,L208767,u921,m60,GONZO,"Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink."
29567,L208766,u920,m60,DUKE,Lucy.
29568,L208765,u921,m60,GONZO,Plans?
29569,L208764,u920,m60,DUKE,WELL? What are your plans?
29570,L208753,u921,m60,GONZO,"It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."""
29571,L208752,u920,m60,DUKE,You degenerate pig!
29572,L208724,u921,m60,GONZO,You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
29573,L208723,u920,m60,DUKE,What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
29574,L208722,u921,m60,GONZO,What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
29575,L208721,u920,m60,DUKE,You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
29576,L208645,u921,m60,GONZO,Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
29577,L208644,u920,m60,DUKE,There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
29578,L208643,u921,m60,GONZO,The cops?
29579,L208642,u920,m60,DUKE,"Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!"
29580,L208641,u921,m60,GONZO,You cheap honky sonofabitch...
29581,L208640,u920,m60,DUKE,Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
29582,L208639,u921,m60,GONZO,"You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?"
29583,L208635,u920,m60,DUKE,Are you ready?
29584,L208634,u921,m60,GONZO,Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
29585,L208632,u921,m60,GONZO,Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
29586,L208631,u920,m60,DUKE,Jesus.
29587,L208630,u921,m60,GONZO,BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
29588,L208629,u920,m60,DUKE,Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
29589,L208628,u921,m60,GONZO,"Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!"
29590,L208627,u920,m60,DUKE,Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
29591,L208626,u921,m60,GONZO,I want that fucking radio!
29592,L208623,u921,m60,GONZO,Whatever's right.
29593,L208622,u920,m60,DUKE,How about a check?
29594,L208621,u921,m60,GONZO,"Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?"
29595,L208620,u920,m60,DUKE,"OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day."
29596,L208619,u921,m60,GONZO,I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
29597,L208618,u920,m60,DUKE,You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
29598,L208617,u921,m60,GONZO,"Jefferson Airplane. ""White Rabbit."" I want a rising sound."
29599,L208616,u920,m60,DUKE,What tape?
29600,L208615,u921,m60,GONZO,Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
29601,L208614,u920,m60,DUKE,"You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble."
29602,L208607,u920,m60,DUKE,Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
29603,L208606,u921,m60,GONZO,Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
29604,L208591,u921,m60,GONZO,They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
29605,L208590,u920,m60,DUKE,What limes?
29606,L208589,u921,m60,GONZO,Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
29607,L208588,u920,m60,DUKE,Where'd you get that knife?
29608,L208587,u921,m60,GONZO,"That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!"
29609,L208586,u920,m60,DUKE,That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
29610,L208585,u921,m60,GONZO,That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
29611,L208584,u920,m60,DUKE,He told me he was turning in early...
29612,L208583,u921,m60,GONZO,Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
29613,L208582,u920,m60,DUKE,"No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason."
29614,L208581,u921,m60,GONZO,Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
29615,L208580,u920,m60,DUKE,What for?
29616,L208579,u921,m60,GONZO,Yeah... I thought we might need it...
29617,L208573,u921,m60,GONZO,You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
29618,L208572,u920,m60,DUKE,Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
29619,L208571,u920,m60,DUKE,Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
29620,L208570,u921,m60,GONZO,Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
29621,L208569,u920,m60,DUKE,Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
29622,L208568,u921,m60,GONZO,Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
29623,L208564,u920,m60,DUKE,It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
29624,L208563,u921,m60,GONZO,When does this thing stop?
29625,L208560,u921,m60,GONZO,Do they pay you to screw that bear?
29626,L208559,u920,m60,DUKE,OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.
29627,L208558,u921,m60,GONZO,I want to leave fast.
29628,L208557,u920,m60,DUKE,That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
29629,L208556,u921,m60,GONZO,Can we make it?
29630,L208555,u920,m60,DUKE,OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
29631,L208554,u921,m60,GONZO,No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
29632,L208553,u920,m60,DUKE,Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
29633,L208552,u921,m60,GONZO,Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
29634,L208551,u920,m60,DUKE,GO?
29635,L208550,u921,m60,GONZO,I have to go.
29636,L208549,u920,m60,DUKE,Not much. Why?
29637,L208548,u921,m60,GONZO,"Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?"
29638,L208547,u920,m60,DUKE,Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
29639,L208546,u921,m60,GONZO,That's what gives me The Fear.
29640,L208545,u920,m60,DUKE,"Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve."
29641,L208544,u921,m60,GONZO,"I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear."
29642,L208536,u921,m60,GONZO,Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
29643,L208535,u920,m60,DUKE,"Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?"
29644,L208534,u920,m60,DUKE,Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
29645,L208531,u921,m60,GONZO,Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
29646,L208530,u920,m60,DUKE,This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
29647,L208525,u921,m60,GONZO,We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
29648,L208524,u920,m60,DUKE,Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
29649,L208523,u921,m60,GONZO,Jesus creeping shit!
29650,L208516,u921,m60,GONZO,What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
29651,L208515,u920,m60,DUKE,Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
29652,L208509,u921,m60,GONZO,Why what?
29653,L208508,u920,m60,DUKE,Why?
29654,L208506,u921,m60,GONZO,"To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!"
29655,L208505,u920,m60,DUKE,"Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?"
29656,L208504,u921,m60,GONZO,"How about ""Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?"" ""Hot Slots,"" that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs..."
29657,L208503,u920,m60,DUKE,"Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!"
29658,L208453,u920,m60,DUKE,They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
29659,L208452,u921,m60,GONZO,I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
29660,L208451,u920,m60,DUKE,That's good...
29661,L208446,u921,m60,GONZO,"You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there..."
29662,L208445,u920,m60,DUKE,What are you talking about?
29663,L208441,u920,m60,DUKE,Not yet. I want to study its habits.
29664,L208440,u921,m60,GONZO,Shoot it.
29665,L208435,u920,m60,DUKE,"No, no. Don't leave me!"
29666,L208434,u921,m60,GONZO,"That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room."
29667,L208432,u920,m60,DUKE,But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
29668,L208431,u921,m60,GONZO,I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
29669,L208430,u921,m60,GONZO,If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
29670,L208429,u920,m60,DUKE,I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
29671,L208426,u920,m60,DUKE,Lacerda?
29672,L208425,u921,m60,GONZO,"Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?"
29673,L208411,u920,m60,DUKE,Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
29674,L208410,u921,m60,GONZO,"Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid."
29675,L208409,u920,m60,DUKE,How long do I have?
29676,L208407,u920,m60,DUKE,You whore!
29677,L208406,u921,m60,GONZO,You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
29678,L208405,u920,m60,DUKE,"God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!"
29679,L208404,u921,m60,GONZO,"Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?"
29680,L208398,u920,m60,DUKE,And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
29681,L208397,u921,m60,GONZO,Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
29682,L208396,u921,m60,GONZO,"The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?"
29683,L208395,u920,m60,DUKE,Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
29684,L208394,u921,m60,GONZO,What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
29685,L208393,u920,m60,DUKE,You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
29686,L208392,u921,m60,GONZO,Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
29687,L208390,u920,m60,DUKE,"The medicine? Yes, it's right here."
29688,L208389,u921,m60,GONZO,Where's the medicine?
29689,L208388,u921,m60,GONZO,My heart!
29690,L208387,u920,m60,DUKE,"He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me."
29691,L208386,u920,m60,DUKE,"My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!"
29692,L208385,u921,m60,GONZO,Damn right!
29693,L208384,u920,m60,DUKE,...and we're chock full of that!
29694,L208370,u920,m60,DUKE,We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
29695,L208369,u921,m60,GONZO,We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
29696,L208368,u920,m60,DUKE,"Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars."
29697,L208367,u921,m60,GONZO,"O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?"
29698,L208362,u921,m60,GONZO,Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
29699,L208361,u920,m60,DUKE,"I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end."
29700,L208360,u920,m60,DUKE,"Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right."
29701,L208359,u921,m60,GONZO,"God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves."
29702,L208342,u921,m60,GONZO,It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
29703,L208341,u920,m60,DUKE,Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
29704,L208340,u920,m60,DUKE,Jesus! Did I say that?
29705,L208339,u920,m60,DUKE,"If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs..."
29706,L208336,u920,m60,DUKE,No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
29707,L208335,u921,m60,GONZO,We're your friends. We're not like the others.
29708,L208330,u920,m60,DUKE,One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
29709,L208329,u921,m60,GONZO,"""One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."""
29710,L208987,u924,m60,MAID,I fear nothing.
29711,L208986,u920,m60,DUKE,"The password is: ""One Hand Washes The Other."" The minute you hear that, you say ""I fear nothing."""
29712,L208981,u924,m60,MAID,Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
29713,L208980,u920,m60,DUKE,"You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?"
29714,L208979,u924,m60,MAID,You'd pay me for that?
29715,L208971,u924,m60,MAID,No! I swear I'm not!
29716,L208970,u920,m60,DUKE,Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
29717,L208967,u924,m60,MAID,"I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!"
29718,L208966,u920,m60,DUKE,The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
29719,L208961,u924,m60,MAID,Nobody. I'm the maid!
29720,L208960,u920,m60,DUKE,What made you do it? Who paid you off?
29721,L208958,u920,m60,DUKE,YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
29722,L208957,u924,m60,MAID,Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
29723,L208715,u920,m60,DUKE,I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
29724,L208714,u922,m60,HIGHWAY PATROLMAN,Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
29725,L208713,u920,m60,DUKE,How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
29726,L208712,u922,m60,HIGHWAY PATROLMAN,"Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?"
29727,L208711,u920,m60,DUKE,"A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours."
29728,L208710,u922,m60,HIGHWAY PATROLMAN,You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
29729,L208709,u922,m60,HIGHWAY PATROLMAN,That's a strange attitude.
29730,L208708,u920,m60,DUKE,"Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal."
29731,L208707,u922,m60,HIGHWAY PATROLMAN,You realize...
29732,L208706,u920,m60,DUKE,Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
29733,L208705,u922,m60,HIGHWAY PATROLMAN,"Could I have that, please?"
29734,L208703,u920,m60,DUKE,"Of course, officer."
29735,L208702,u922,m60,HIGHWAY PATROLMAN,May I see your license.
29736,L208990,u921,m60,GONZO,"Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people."
29737,L208989,u924,m60,MAID,"Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened..."
29738,L208988,u921,m60,GONZO,"Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?"
29739,L208985,u921,m60,GONZO,You and a lot of other people.
29740,L208984,u924,m60,MAID,Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
29741,L208978,u921,m60,GONZO,"One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem."
29742,L208977,u924,m60,MAID,What?
29743,L208973,u924,m60,MAID,Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
29744,L208972,u921,m60,GONZO,"In that case, maybe she can help."
29745,L208969,u924,m60,MAID,No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
29746,L208968,u921,m60,GONZO,"Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman."
29747,L208965,u924,m60,MAID,Part of what?
29748,L208964,u921,m60,GONZO,Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
29749,L208963,u924,m60,MAID,I don't know what you're talking about!
29750,L208962,u921,m60,GONZO,You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
29751,L211194,u926,m61,ADULTERER,They'll get in! We'll all die!
29752,L211193,u939,m61,TRAMPY,YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
29753,L211189,u926,m61,ADULTERER,"They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!"
29754,L211188,u939,m61,TRAMPY,What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
29755,L211187,u926,m61,ADULTERER,Stop!
29756,L210904,u939,m61,TRAMPY,"I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye."
29757,L210903,u926,m61,ADULTERER,Spare me.
29758,L210902,u939,m61,TRAMPY,It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
29759,L211396,u926,m61,ADULTERER,"I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?"
29760,L211395,u935,m61,HEROINE,Where is everyone?
29761,L211394,u926,m61,ADULTERER,"Sorry, didn't mean to scare you."
29762,L211388,u935,m61,HEROINE,We're going to get my little girl.
29763,L211387,u926,m61,ADULTERER,Where are you two going?
29764,L211382,u926,m61,ADULTERER,I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
29765,L211381,u935,m61,HEROINE,We'll meet in three hours?
29766,L211380,u926,m61,ADULTERER,"Um, yeah, thirty miles east."
29767,L211379,u935,m61,HEROINE,You know where it is?
29768,L211377,u926,m61,ADULTERER,"Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!"
29769,L211376,u935,m61,HEROINE,They'll be back.
29770,L211375,u926,m61,ADULTERER,Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
29771,L211301,u935,m61,HEROINE,"He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons."
29772,L211300,u926,m61,ADULTERER,We should go! We should go right now!
29773,L211192,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Don't be stupid, drop the gun!"
29774,L211191,u926,m61,ADULTERER,I will not die because of him!
29775,L210832,u926,m61,ADULTERER,"I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --"
29776,L210831,u935,m61,HEROINE,Careful.
29777,L210720,u926,m61,ADULTERER,Right.
29778,L210719,u935,m61,HEROINE,We can't risk letting them in.
29779,L210718,u926,m61,ADULTERER,You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
29780,L210847,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,With what just happened upstairs --
29781,L210846,u927,m61,BARTENDER,I don't think you should...
29782,L210805,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"I got shells too, box and a half, tops."
29783,L210804,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge."
29784,L210758,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,But it's got teeth.
29785,L210757,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"Well, it don't look pretty."
29786,L210644,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Her fella.
29787,L210643,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
29788,L210641,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"Nah, I got the gun."
29789,L210640,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
29790,L210639,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Yeah.
29791,L210638,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,IS IT CLEAR?!
29792,L211203,u928,m61,BEER GUY,We're lucky to be alive.
29793,L211202,u927,m61,BARTENDER,We shot a skunk.
29794,L211139,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
29795,L211138,u928,m61,BEER GUY,Stop it.
29796,L210952,u928,m61,BEER GUY,Anyone.
29797,L210951,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Who the hell would you call?
29798,L210950,u928,m61,BEER GUY,"I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here."
29799,L210551,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Gonna stay for a couple?
29800,L210550,u928,m61,BEER GUY,"One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry."
29801,L211252,u931,m61,BOZO,You gotta be with me on this.
29802,L211251,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"Well, your last words can be ""I told you so."""
29803,L211250,u931,m61,BOZO,"We'll be food, dickheads!"
29804,L211246,u931,m61,BOZO,"If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all."
29805,L211245,u927,m61,BARTENDER,You got something better?
29806,L211008,u931,m61,BOZO,OPEN THE DOOR!
29807,L211007,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Wha?
29808,L211005,u931,m61,BOZO,"""OH!?"" WHAT IS ""OH?"" What does ""oh"" mean?"
29809,L211004,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Oh!
29810,L210989,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"Come on, come on."
29811,L210988,u931,m61,BOZO,"Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps."
29812,L210958,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Upstairs.
29813,L210957,u931,m61,BOZO,Where's that?
29814,L210956,u927,m61,BARTENDER,I think I know where a CB is.
29815,L210601,u931,m61,BOZO,C'mon guys--
29816,L210600,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Hey! Get quiet or get out.
29817,L211261,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday."
29818,L211260,u927,m61,BARTENDER,You seem mighty collected about this.
29819,L211157,u935,m61,HEROINE,Just move!
29820,L211156,u927,m61,BARTENDER,I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
29821,L211124,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Shit!
29822,L211123,u935,m61,HEROINE,We just smeared a skunk.
29823,L211083,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"In the corner, behind the curtain."
29824,L211082,u935,m61,HEROINE,Where's the tunnel?
29825,L211081,u935,m61,HEROINE,Follow me.
29826,L211080,u927,m61,BARTENDER,You all sure about this?
29827,L211059,u927,m61,BARTENDER,This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
29828,L211058,u935,m61,HEROINE,"This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go."
29829,L211057,u927,m61,BARTENDER,What!? I'm not going down there again!
29830,L211056,u935,m61,HEROINE,"HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him."
29831,L211033,u935,m61,HEROINE,What's it for?
29832,L211032,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there."
29833,L211031,u935,m61,HEROINE,What tunnel? Where?
29834,L211030,u927,m61,BARTENDER,There's a tunnel.
29835,L211029,u935,m61,HEROINE,Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
29836,L210992,u935,m61,HEROINE,Easy.
29837,L210991,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke."
29838,L210977,u935,m61,HEROINE,Hey!
29839,L210976,u927,m61,BARTENDER,They're right here.
29840,L210792,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"Well, justice is funny."
29841,L210791,u935,m61,HEROINE,"No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran."
29842,L210790,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"So, your husband ditched you?"
29843,L210788,u927,m61,BARTENDER,And the head?
29844,L210787,u935,m61,HEROINE,And that's how I ended up here.
29845,L210666,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside."
29846,L210665,u927,m61,BARTENDER,And the rest of 'em?
29847,L210664,u935,m61,HEROINE,"That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed."
29848,L211143,u937,m61,ROADIE,"Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?"
29849,L211142,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Just an observation.
29850,L211141,u937,m61,ROADIE,"That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?"
29851,L211122,u937,m61,ROADIE,Look.
29852,L211121,u927,m61,BARTENDER,What?
29853,L211120,u937,m61,ROADIE,Ohhh.
29854,L211097,u937,m61,ROADIE,The door... on three.
29855,L211096,u927,m61,BARTENDER,"I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles."
29856,L211095,u937,m61,ROADIE,Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
29857,L211094,u927,m61,BARTENDER,No. You?
29858,L211093,u937,m61,ROADIE,Scared?
29859,L211055,u927,m61,BARTENDER,Get in line!
29860,L211054,u937,m61,ROADIE,Fuck you too.
29861,L211053,u927,m61,BARTENDER,You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
29862,L211208,u928,m61,BEER GUY,My truck.
29863,L211207,u931,m61,BOZO,"What now, Geronimo?"
29864,L211181,u931,m61,BOZO,He's dead.
29865,L211180,u928,m61,BEER GUY,Come on!
29866,L210969,u931,m61,BOZO,Who's with me?
29867,L210968,u928,m61,BEER GUY,We're better off.
29868,L210955,u931,m61,BOZO,"Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner."
29869,L210954,u928,m61,BEER GUY,Well then I guess we should just give up.
29870,L210953,u931,m61,BOZO,"Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?"
29871,L210854,u928,m61,BEER GUY,Oh yeah?
29872,L210853,u931,m61,BOZO,"I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it."
29873,L210752,u931,m61,BOZO,Go douche.
29874,L210751,u928,m61,BEER GUY,You weren't helpin'.
29875,L210750,u931,m61,BOZO,Any more ideas Animal Planet?
29876,L210707,u928,m61,BEER GUY,Fuck no.
29877,L210706,u931,m61,BOZO,Why don't you go check it out?
29878,L210705,u928,m61,BEER GUY,"So, what now? Did those things leave?"
29879,L210875,u936,m61,PARA,We lived near power lines.
29880,L210874,u928,m61,BEER GUY,Your parents of relation?
29881,L210873,u936,m61,PARA,Yep.
29882,L210872,u928,m61,BEER GUY,"Your brother, huh?"
29883,L210871,u936,m61,PARA,"Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera."
29884,L210870,u928,m61,BEER GUY,Why do you take shit from him?
29885,L211256,u928,m61,BEER GUY,Just cover me. It was built to move.
29886,L211255,u935,m61,HEROINE,It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
29887,L211239,u935,m61,HEROINE,But not flush against the tunnel?
29888,L211238,u928,m61,BEER GUY,"Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back."
29889,L211233,u928,m61,BEER GUY,"Nothing, this was my last delivery."
29890,L211232,u935,m61,HEROINE,What's in the back?
29891,L211231,u928,m61,BEER GUY,"My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here."
29892,L211226,u928,m61,BEER GUY,"Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here."
29893,L211225,u935,m61,HEROINE,All right!  Tell us about the truck!
29894,L211130,u935,m61,HEROINE,What?
29895,L211129,u928,m61,BEER GUY,We gotta be close.
29896,L211070,u935,m61,HEROINE,Anybody else?
29897,L211069,u928,m61,BEER GUY,We gotta try.
29898,L211068,u935,m61,HEROINE,We're going to get help.
29899,L211061,u935,m61,HEROINE,Anyone else?
29900,L211060,u928,m61,BEER GUY,I'm in.
29901,L210941,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising."
29902,L210940,u929,m61,BELLE,What? Really?
29903,L210939,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this."
29904,L210938,u929,m61,BELLE,How much you got to see the show?
29905,L210937,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"How much I got, what?"
29906,L210936,u929,m61,BELLE,How much you got?
29907,L210935,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Sure.
29908,L210934,u929,m61,BELLE,"You wanna see, baby?"
29909,L210931,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,The girl's got rhythm.
29910,L210930,u929,m61,BELLE,Um-hmmm.
29911,L210927,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"I can't feel a thing, Hon."
29912,L210926,u929,m61,BELLE,Doesn't your foot hurt?
29913,L210895,u929,m61,BELLE,Okay then.
29914,L210894,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"It's much safer in there, sweety."
29915,L210893,u929,m61,BELLE,But --
29916,L210892,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there."
29917,L210891,u929,m61,BELLE,Why not then?
29918,L210890,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time."
29919,L210889,u929,m61,BELLE,Will I go crazy or something?
29920,L210888,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
29921,L210887,u929,m61,BELLE,Really?
29922,L210886,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
29923,L210885,u929,m61,BELLE,"Oh, no."
29924,L210884,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Magic potion.  You should try a little.
29925,L210883,u929,m61,BELLE,What is this?
29926,L210882,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
29927,L210881,u929,m61,BELLE,Oh.
29928,L210880,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"Push and twist, it's child proof."
29929,L210878,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Well...
29930,L210877,u929,m61,BELLE,How are you holding up?
29931,L211051,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
29932,L211050,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!"
29933,L211049,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
29934,L211048,u935,m61,HEROINE,Keys.
29935,L211047,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Seven.
29936,L211046,u935,m61,HEROINE,Nine?
29937,L211045,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Seven.
29938,L211044,u935,m61,HEROINE,Max?
29939,L211043,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Holds four.
29940,L211042,u935,m61,HEROINE,How many?
29941,L211041,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Covered.
29942,L211040,u935,m61,HEROINE,Open?
29943,L211039,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Two.
29944,L211038,u935,m61,HEROINE,Four door?
29945,L211037,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Fully.
29946,L211036,u935,m61,HEROINE,Is it gassed up?
29947,L211035,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever."
29948,L211034,u935,m61,HEROINE,What's it for!?
29949,L211026,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Nothing.
29950,L211025,u935,m61,HEROINE,What's going on between you two?
29951,L211024,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Huh?
29952,L211023,u935,m61,HEROINE,What do you mean what?
29953,L211022,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,What?
29954,L211021,u935,m61,HEROINE,What?
29955,L210961,u935,m61,HEROINE,"You're wasting your time, there's no one out there."
29956,L210960,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
29957,L210840,u935,m61,HEROINE,"No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed."
29958,L210839,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"In the kitchen, under the sink."
29959,L210761,u935,m61,HEROINE,Good.
29960,L210760,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts."
29961,L210759,u935,m61,HEROINE,Will these boards hold?
29962,L210656,u935,m61,HEROINE,He shot you the other time.
29963,L210655,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Huh?
29964,L210654,u935,m61,HEROINE,He only shot you once.
29965,L210653,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?"
29966,L210652,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex."
29967,L210651,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
29968,L210648,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,What?
29969,L210647,u935,m61,HEROINE,He's dead.
29970,L210646,u930,m61,BOSS MAN,"Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?"
29971,L210645,u935,m61,HEROINE,My husband...
29972,L210971,u931,m61,BOZO,"What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon."
29973,L210970,u934,m61,GRANDPA,I'll go with ya.
29974,L210830,u931,m61,BOZO,They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
29975,L210829,u934,m61,GRANDPA,"I wouldn't do that, son."
29976,L210814,u931,m61,BOZO,"I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew."
29977,L210813,u934,m61,GRANDPA,"Sit still, look less like a meal."
29978,L210812,u931,m61,BOZO,Oh? And what's that?
29979,L210811,u934,m61,GRANDPA,"You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy."
29980,L210587,u931,m61,BOZO,Whoa!
29981,L210586,u934,m61,GRANDPA,"This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep."
29982,L210583,u934,m61,GRANDPA,Get outta here.
29983,L210582,u931,m61,BOZO,What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
29984,L211338,u937,m61,ROADIE,Clear!
29985,L211337,u931,m61,BOZO,Blow the goddamn hatch!
29986,L211274,u931,m61,BOZO,What the hell's going on here!?
29987,L211273,u937,m61,ROADIE,Clever fuckers.
29988,L211248,u931,m61,BOZO,No bullshit.
29989,L211247,u937,m61,ROADIE,Bullshit.
29990,L211244,u931,m61,BOZO,"Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?"
29991,L211243,u937,m61,ROADIE,"Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride."
29992,L211201,u931,m61,BOZO,You smell like ass!
29993,L211200,u937,m61,ROADIE,They were all over the place.
29994,L211197,u937,m61,ROADIE,F-f-fuck you.
29995,L211196,u931,m61,BOZO,Welcome back.
29996,L211258,u935,m61,HEROINE,"There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?"
29997,L211257,u931,m61,BOZO,"Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?"
29998,L211205,u935,m61,HEROINE,Get something on that.
29999,L211204,u931,m61,BOZO,"Yeah, maybe."
30000,L211013,u931,m61,BOZO,HELLLLLLLLP!!
30001,L211012,u935,m61,HEROINE,COME ON!
30002,L211001,u935,m61,HEROINE,MOVE YOUR ASS!
30003,L211000,u931,m61,BOZO,SHIT.
30004,L210999,u931,m61,BOZO,REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
30005,L210998,u935,m61,HEROINE,Hurry!
30006,L210995,u935,m61,HEROINE,If he doesn't shut up...
30007,L210994,u931,m61,BOZO,JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
30008,L210985,u931,m61,BOZO,I'm fine! I'm fine!
30009,L210984,u935,m61,HEROINE,Shit!
30010,L210982,u931,m61,BOZO,You keep that key handy.
30011,L210981,u935,m61,HEROINE,Move it!
30012,L210980,u931,m61,BOZO,No shit.
30013,L210979,u935,m61,HEROINE,Move slow and move quiet.
30014,L210978,u931,m61,BOZO,What?!
30015,L210974,u935,m61,HEROINE,Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
30016,L210973,u931,m61,BOZO,"Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?"
30017,L210972,u935,m61,HEROINE,You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
30018,L210967,u935,m61,HEROINE,We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
30019,L210966,u931,m61,BOZO,What?
30020,L210965,u935,m61,HEROINE,"NO, but I will lock you in."
30021,L210964,u931,m61,BOZO,Gimme the keys.
30022,L210963,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Fine, Chief."
30023,L210836,u931,m61,BOZO,Duh hickey.
30024,L210835,u935,m61,HEROINE,"'Eh, Chief?"
30025,L210628,u935,m61,HEROINE,HOLD THAT TIGHT!
30026,L210627,u931,m61,BOZO,Got 'cha!
30027,L211344,u936,m61,PARA,HELLLPPP!
30028,L211343,u931,m61,BOZO,OH JESUS!
30029,L211305,u931,m61,BOZO,"Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose."
30030,L211304,u936,m61,PARA,Am I too heavy for you?
30031,L211303,u931,m61,BOZO,"Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together."
30032,L211254,u931,m61,BOZO,Amazing you made it this far.
30033,L211253,u936,m61,PARA,"I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good."
30034,L211221,u931,m61,BOZO,BONSAI!
30035,L211220,u936,m61,PARA,HELP MEEE!
30036,L210861,u931,m61,BOZO,I'm sure.
30037,L210860,u936,m61,PARA,You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
30038,L210859,u931,m61,BOZO,"You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it."
30039,L211137,u932,m61,GOLDIE,I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
30040,L211136,u935,m61,HEROINE,Let's move.
30041,L211072,u935,m61,HEROINE,Ok. Let's see what happens.
30042,L211071,u932,m61,GOLDIE,"Yeah, I'll go."
30043,L211020,u935,m61,HEROINE,Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
30044,L211019,u932,m61,GOLDIE,"Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?"
30045,L210844,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?"
30046,L210843,u932,m61,GOLDIE,Hey!
30047,L210821,u935,m61,HEROINE,"As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack."
30048,L210820,u932,m61,GOLDIE,"Well, maybe they migrate?"
30049,L211228,u935,m61,HEROINE,They'll tear this place down within the hour.
30050,L211227,u933,m61,GOOD GUY,Let's wait it out.
30051,L211149,u935,m61,HEROINE,YOU'LL HIT US!
30052,L211148,u933,m61,GOOD GUY,DON'T!
30053,L211102,u933,m61,GOOD GUY,"She's not very nice, is she?"
30054,L211101,u935,m61,HEROINE,Let's go.
30055,L211088,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Nothing, just lookin'."
30056,L211087,u933,m61,GOOD GUY,What's wrong?
30057,L210803,u935,m61,HEROINE,Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
30058,L210802,u933,m61,GOOD GUY,Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
30059,L211340,u937,m61,ROADIE,GO-GO-GO!!
30060,L211339,u935,m61,HEROINE,Get to your cars!
30061,L211324,u935,m61,HEROINE,Go!!!
30062,L211323,u937,m61,ROADIE,Not without you!!!
30063,L211322,u935,m61,HEROINE,Go! Go!
30064,L211237,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?"
30065,L211236,u937,m61,ROADIE,"If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them."
30066,L211154,u935,m61,HEROINE,Wait God-dammit!
30067,L211153,u937,m61,ROADIE,Let's go!
30068,L211118,u937,m61,ROADIE,Whoa!
30069,L211117,u935,m61,HEROINE,Hold it!
30070,L210869,u935,m61,HEROINE,That's fine.
30071,L210868,u937,m61,ROADIE,There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
30072,L210807,u937,m61,ROADIE,"So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks."
30073,L210806,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Okay, well that's something."
30074,L210672,u935,m61,HEROINE,"Father. The biggest, the strongest..."
30075,L210671,u937,m61,ROADIE,And the last one is the...
30076,L210670,u935,m61,HEROINE,"If you are face to face with her, dive left."
30077,L211374,u935,m61,HEROINE,I think --
30078,L211373,u941,m61,TUFFY,Did we make it?
30079,L211307,u941,m61,TUFFY,I'd love to.
30080,L211306,u935,m61,HEROINE,We should stick together out there.
30081,L210925,u941,m61,TUFFY,Deal.
30082,L210924,u935,m61,HEROINE,I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
30083,L210923,u941,m61,TUFFY,I'll do anything to help.
30084,L210922,u935,m61,HEROINE,"She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her."
30085,L210921,u941,m61,TUFFY,Oh...
30086,L210920,u935,m61,HEROINE,Her name is Charlie.
30087,L210919,u935,m61,HEROINE,Right.
30088,L210918,u941,m61,TUFFY,"We all have to be strong, right?"
30089,L210917,u935,m61,HEROINE,I admire your strength.
30090,L210916,u941,m61,TUFFY,"I'm fine, I really am."
30091,L210915,u935,m61,HEROINE,You know you don't have to do this.
30092,L210849,u935,m61,HEROINE,All right.
30093,L210848,u941,m61,TUFFY,Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
30094,L210684,u935,m61,HEROINE,Let's lock off this room.
30095,L210683,u941,m61,TUFFY,"Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go."
30096,L210679,u935,m61,HEROINE,Stop her!
30097,L210678,u941,m61,TUFFY,"Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!"
30098,L210661,u935,m61,HEROINE,That's one piece of four problems.
30099,L210660,u941,m61,TUFFY,Oh my God... What is that?
30100,L210530,u938,m61,SICKLY BROWNIE,I just hit it like you said.
30101,L210529,u940,m61,TROOP LEADER,"What have you done now, broke the darn thing?"
30102,L210524,u938,m61,SICKLY BROWNIE,I said I'm not lying.
30103,L210523,u940,m61,TROOP LEADER,"You know that no one likes a liar, right?"
30104,L210522,u938,m61,SICKLY BROWNIE,I'm not lying.
30105,L210521,u940,m61,TROOP LEADER,What did we say about lying?
30106,L210520,u938,m61,SICKLY BROWNIE,Well...
30107,L210519,u940,m61,TROOP LEADER,Are you lying to me?
30108,L210518,u938,m61,SICKLY BROWNIE,"Um, well..."
30109,L210517,u940,m61,TROOP LEADER,Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
30110,L210516,u938,m61,SICKLY BROWNIE,"Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir."
30111,L210515,u940,m61,TROOP LEADER,"Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?"
30112,L221504,u942,m62,BARNES,I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
30113,L221503,u955,m62,FRANCES,'Forgive'...? For What?
30114,L221502,u942,m62,BARNES,"Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you."
30115,L221501,u955,m62,FRANCES,Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
30116,L221500,u942,m62,BARNES,"Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out."
30117,L221499,u955,m62,FRANCES,Putting on my armor.
30118,L221498,u942,m62,BARNES,What're you doing?
30119,L221497,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Refill my drink, will you, Bob?"
30120,L221496,u942,m62,BARNES,Frances?  Oh no.
30121,L221479,u942,m62,BARNES,Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
30122,L221478,u955,m62,FRANCES,"So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?"
30123,L221477,u942,m62,BARNES,"Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off."
30124,L221476,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em."
30125,L221475,u942,m62,BARNES,"Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?"
30126,L221474,u955,m62,FRANCES,But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
30127,L221473,u942,m62,BARNES,"Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!"
30128,L221472,u955,m62,FRANCES,This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
30129,L221471,u942,m62,BARNES,Well... come on.
30130,L221389,u943,m62,BEBE,I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
30131,L221388,u961,m62,LAWYER,"Oh. I mean, good."
30132,L221387,u943,m62,BEBE,"That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it."
30133,L221386,u961,m62,LAWYER,"Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics."
30134,L221385,u943,m62,BEBE,"I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me."
30135,L221384,u961,m62,LAWYER,"Excuse me, sir?"
30136,L221383,u943,m62,BEBE,"I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me..."
30137,L221382,u961,m62,LAWYER,"And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures."
30138,L221161,u943,m62,BEBE,Very fine bone structure.
30139,L221160,u944,m62,CLAIRE,"I guess so, sir."
30140,L221159,u943,m62,BEBE,Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
30141,L221158,u944,m62,CLAIRE,"Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option."
30142,L221157,u943,m62,BEBE,Who's this?
30143,L221156,u944,m62,CLAIRE,"Good morning, Mr. Bebe!"
30144,L221470,u943,m62,BEBE,I'd like nothing better.
30145,L221469,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it."
30146,L221230,u943,m62,BEBE,"That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act."
30147,L221229,u955,m62,FRANCES,But I'm the one up there on the screen.
30148,L221228,u943,m62,BEBE,"No, I'm concerned with everything."
30149,L221227,u955,m62,FRANCES,"But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe."
30150,L221226,u943,m62,BEBE,"Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?"
30151,L221225,u943,m62,BEBE,Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
30152,L221224,u955,m62,FRANCES,Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
30153,L221223,u943,m62,BEBE,"Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called ""Come and Get It."""
30154,L221222,u943,m62,BEBE,I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
30155,L221221,u955,m62,FRANCES,Thank you --
30156,L221220,u943,m62,BEBE,"I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --"
30157,L221219,u943,m62,BEBE,You see: We've got to change that name.
30158,L221218,u955,m62,FRANCES,That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
30159,L221310,u944,m62,CLAIRE,...acts. I'll relay your message.
30160,L221309,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'"
30161,L221308,u944,m62,CLAIRE,"I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?"
30162,L221307,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies."
30163,L221306,u944,m62,CLAIRE,"That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies."
30164,L221304,u955,m62,FRANCES,Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
30165,L221303,u944,m62,CLAIRE,You know what I mean.
30166,L221302,u955,m62,FRANCES,I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
30167,L221301,u944,m62,CLAIRE,"Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously."
30168,L221300,u955,m62,FRANCES,It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
30169,L221299,u944,m62,CLAIRE,"Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --"
30170,L221298,u955,m62,FRANCES,My clothes?
30171,L221297,u944,m62,CLAIRE,"Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes."
30172,L221296,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way."
30173,L221295,u944,m62,CLAIRE,"Hi Frances, got a minute?"
30174,L221381,u945,m62,CLIFFORD,Come here. I want to show you something.
30175,L221380,u955,m62,FRANCES,Huh.
30176,L221379,u945,m62,CLIFFORD,"Okay, but come here first."
30177,L221378,u955,m62,FRANCES,Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
30178,L221377,u945,m62,CLIFFORD,"Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to..."
30179,L221376,u955,m62,FRANCES,Thank you.
30180,L221375,u945,m62,CLIFFORD,Madam...?
30181,L221374,u955,m62,FRANCES,What?
30182,L221373,u945,m62,CLIFFORD,"Good, good. Give them that."
30183,L221372,u955,m62,FRANCES,"God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!"
30184,L221371,u945,m62,CLIFFORD,"You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --"
30185,L221370,u955,m62,FRANCES,I'm not!
30186,L221369,u945,m62,CLIFFORD,You're afraid!
30187,L221368,u955,m62,FRANCES,I'm not!
30188,L221367,u945,m62,CLIFFORD,Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
30189,L221450,u946,m62,CLURMAN,"He knows, Frances."
30190,L221449,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?"
30191,L221448,u946,m62,CLURMAN,Right now we have to be practical.
30192,L221447,u955,m62,FRANCES,What does Clifford say?
30193,L221446,u946,m62,CLURMAN,"I know, but --"
30194,L221445,u955,m62,FRANCES,"But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!"
30195,L221444,u946,m62,CLURMAN,Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
30196,L221443,u955,m62,FRANCES,A rich actress.
30197,L221442,u946,m62,CLURMAN,An actress.
30198,L221441,u955,m62,FRANCES,Who?
30199,L221440,u946,m62,CLURMAN,"What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it."
30200,L221439,u955,m62,FRANCES,You don't think I'm good enough?
30201,L221438,u946,m62,CLURMAN,"Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London."
30202,L221437,u955,m62,FRANCES,That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
30203,L221436,u946,m62,CLURMAN,I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
30204,L221435,u955,m62,FRANCES,What's up?
30205,L221433,u955,m62,FRANCES,Oh.
30206,L221432,u946,m62,CLURMAN,He's not here.
30207,L221431,u955,m62,FRANCES,Where's Clifford?
30208,L221430,u946,m62,CLURMAN,Frances.
30209,L221429,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Hello, Harold."
30210,L221365,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford."
30211,L221364,u946,m62,CLURMAN,"...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too."
30212,L221345,u955,m62,FRANCES,Who is she?
30213,L221344,u946,m62,CLURMAN,"Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead..."
30214,L221343,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me."
30215,L221342,u946,m62,CLURMAN,"The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --"
30216,L221588,u947,m62,COP,You're under arrest.
30217,L221587,u955,m62,FRANCES,GET OUT!
30218,L221586,u947,m62,COP,"Get your clothes on, lady --"
30219,L221585,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --"
30220,L221584,u947,m62,COP,Get your clothes on.
30221,L221517,u947,m62,COP,"I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it."
30222,L221516,u955,m62,FRANCES,Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
30223,L221515,u947,m62,COP,"Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says ""Dimout Zone?""  There's a war on, you know?"
30224,L221514,u955,m62,FRANCES,"In my eyes, officer."
30225,L221513,u947,m62,COP,"Hey, where's the fire, sister?"
30226,L221338,u955,m62,FRANCES,You want his name?
30227,L221337,u948,m62,DICK,"The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!"
30228,L221336,u955,m62,FRANCES,What night?
30229,L221335,u948,m62,DICK,"No. It's all about that night, isn't it?"
30230,L221334,u955,m62,FRANCES,No?
30231,L221333,u948,m62,DICK,"I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock."
30232,L221332,u955,m62,FRANCES,Dick...
30233,L221331,u948,m62,DICK,Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
30234,L221330,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Dick, I can't even breathe here..."
30235,L221329,u948,m62,DICK,"Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing."
30236,L221328,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Dick, we need some time apart --"
30237,L221327,u948,m62,DICK,"You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?"
30238,L221326,u955,m62,FRANCES,Showdown.
30239,L221325,u948,m62,DICK,Without me.
30240,L221324,u955,m62,FRANCES,...Yes.
30241,L221323,u948,m62,DICK,"There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?"
30242,L221322,u948,m62,DICK,Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
30243,L221321,u955,m62,FRANCES,Fired?
30244,L221320,u948,m62,DICK,"Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?"
30245,L221319,u955,m62,FRANCES,Claire?
30246,L221318,u948,m62,DICK,"Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?"
30247,L221317,u955,m62,FRANCES,Who?
30248,L221316,u948,m62,DICK,There've been some calls.
30249,L221315,u955,m62,FRANCES,Sort of.
30250,L221314,u948,m62,DICK,You learn your lines?
30251,L221936,u949,m62,DOCTOR,Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
30252,L221935,u956,m62,HARRY,"All square, Doc."
30253,L221934,u949,m62,DOCTOR,"We're all square now, Harry. Right?"
30254,L221932,u956,m62,HARRY,I gotta go now.
30255,L221931,u949,m62,DOCTOR,Harry!
30256,L221928,u956,m62,HARRY,"Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?"
30257,L221927,u949,m62,DOCTOR,Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
30258,L221922,u949,m62,DOCTOR,"I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing."
30259,L221921,u956,m62,HARRY,Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
30260,L221920,u949,m62,DOCTOR,"The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her."
30261,L221919,u956,m62,HARRY,"Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!"
30262,L222024,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Thank you, Harry."
30263,L222023,u950,m62,DOYLE,"We'll get you home, Frances."
30264,L222022,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry."
30265,L221908,u955,m62,FRANCES,"One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?"
30266,L221907,u950,m62,DOYLE,We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
30267,L221906,u955,m62,FRANCES,...I see.
30268,L221905,u950,m62,DOYLE,"Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you."
30269,L221904,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?"
30270,L221903,u950,m62,DOYLE,"Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice."
30271,L221902,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better."
30272,L221901,u950,m62,DOYLE,"I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?"
30273,L221900,u955,m62,FRANCES,...Don't you?
30274,L221899,u950,m62,DOYLE,I know you believe that.
30275,L221898,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it."
30276,L221081,u955,m62,FRANCES,Thank you.
30277,L221080,u951,m62,DRAMA TEACHER,"New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!"
30278,L221079,u955,m62,FRANCES,Really?
30279,L221078,u951,m62,DRAMA TEACHER,"Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York."
30280,L221077,u955,m62,FRANCES,But I'll never win that.
30281,L221076,u951,m62,DRAMA TEACHER,"This is the answer: a subscription drive to ""Voice of Action!"" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!"
30282,L222051,u952,m62,EDWARDS,"Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!"
30283,L222050,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Thank you, Ralph."
30284,L222047,u955,m62,FRANCES,No. Never.
30285,L222046,u952,m62,EDWARDS,Were you a drug addict?
30286,L222045,u955,m62,FRANCES,No.
30287,L222044,u952,m62,EDWARDS,Were you an alcoholic?
30288,L222043,u955,m62,FRANCES,"...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one..."
30289,L222042,u952,m62,EDWARDS,"...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?"
30290,L222002,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I pity us, Dad. I pity us both."
30291,L222001,u953,m62,ERNEST,Are you... are you hungry?
30292,L221999,u955,m62,FRANCES,Daddy!
30293,L221998,u953,m62,ERNEST,"Please, Francie..."
30294,L221997,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?"
30295,L221996,u953,m62,ERNEST,"But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied."
30296,L221995,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you."
30297,L221994,u953,m62,ERNEST,"They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know."
30298,L221993,u955,m62,FRANCES,Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
30299,L221992,u953,m62,ERNEST,"Francie, you know I can't do that."
30300,L221844,u953,m62,ERNEST,"I love you too, Francie."
30301,L221843,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I don't care, Dad. I love you."
30302,L221842,u953,m62,ERNEST,"I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and..."
30303,L221841,u953,m62,ERNEST,Always. Always.
30304,L221840,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?"
30305,L221839,u953,m62,ERNEST,"Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that."
30306,L221838,u955,m62,FRANCES,"But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?"
30307,L221837,u953,m62,ERNEST,"What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know."
30308,L221836,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I know that, Dad, but --"
30309,L221835,u953,m62,ERNEST,"I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you."
30310,L221834,u955,m62,FRANCES,...So what do you think?
30311,L221145,u953,m62,ERNEST,"Be careful, Francie."
30312,L221144,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad."
30313,L221130,u953,m62,ERNEST,...Then go.
30314,L221129,u955,m62,FRANCES,"If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it."
30315,L221128,u953,m62,ERNEST,And you think it's worth all this?
30316,L221127,u955,m62,FRANCES,Of course.
30317,L221126,u953,m62,ERNEST,You really want to go?
30318,L221125,u955,m62,FRANCES,"What do I do, Dad?"
30319,L221068,u953,m62,ERNEST,"Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away."
30320,L221067,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --"
30321,L221047,u955,m62,FRANCES,"And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --"
30322,L221046,u953,m62,ERNEST,I know.
30323,L221045,u955,m62,FRANCES,"It's already started, Dad... with me."
30324,L221043,u955,m62,FRANCES,"He's a socialist, then?"
30325,L221042,u953,m62,ERNEST,"No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation."
30326,L221041,u955,m62,FRANCES,Is Kaminski a Communist?
30327,L221040,u953,m62,ERNEST,"Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous."
30328,L221039,u955,m62,FRANCES,He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
30329,L221038,u953,m62,ERNEST,"Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?"
30330,L221037,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?"
30331,L221036,u953,m62,ERNEST,"You wrote it, didn't you?"
30332,L221035,u955,m62,FRANCES,I didn't have much to do with it.
30333,L221034,u953,m62,ERNEST,An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
30334,L221033,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Thanks, Dad."
30335,L221032,u953,m62,ERNEST,"I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances."
30336,L220966,u955,m62,FRANCES,"See you next weekend, Dad."
30337,L220965,u953,m62,ERNEST,"Bye, baby."
30338,L221064,u953,m62,ERNEST,"That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought."
30339,L221063,u962,m62,LILLIAN,Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
30340,L221062,u953,m62,ERNEST,Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
30341,L221061,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due."
30342,L221060,u953,m62,ERNEST,See you next weekend?
30343,L221059,u962,m62,LILLIAN,Good.
30344,L221058,u953,m62,ERNEST,I'm going back to the hotel.
30345,L221057,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure."
30346,L221056,u953,m62,ERNEST,"No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism."
30347,L221055,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!"
30348,L221054,u953,m62,ERNEST,"They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways."
30349,L221053,u962,m62,LILLIAN,You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
30350,L221052,u953,m62,ERNEST,"I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve..."
30351,L221051,u962,m62,LILLIAN,You're poisoning that child's mind.
30352,L221029,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?"
30353,L221028,u953,m62,ERNEST,Thank you.
30354,L221027,u962,m62,LILLIAN,Bread?
30355,L221026,u962,m62,LILLIAN,I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
30356,L221025,u953,m62,ERNEST,"It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air."
30357,L221178,u954,m62,FIRE CHIEF,"Oh Angela, my own... Angela!"
30358,L221177,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Oh, Kurt!"
30359,L221176,u954,m62,FIRE CHIEF,"No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!"
30360,L221175,u955,m62,FRANCES,"But, Kurt, I..."
30361,L221174,u954,m62,FIRE CHIEF,"Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain..."
30362,L221173,u955,m62,FRANCES,Kurt!
30363,L221595,u966,m62,SERGEANT,Occupation?
30364,L221594,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!"
30365,L221593,u966,m62,SERGEANT,Address?
30366,L221592,u955,m62,FRANCES,Fifteen.
30367,L221591,u966,m62,SERGEANT,Age?
30368,L221590,u955,m62,FRANCES,I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
30369,L221589,u966,m62,SERGEANT,Name?
30370,L221418,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,"You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me."
30371,L221417,u955,m62,FRANCES,Just one minute...
30372,L221415,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Why, you... you little bastard!"
30373,L221414,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
30374,L221413,u955,m62,FRANCES,What is this?
30375,L221412,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,"Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean."
30376,L221411,u955,m62,FRANCES,What?
30377,L221410,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,What about your husband?
30378,L221409,u955,m62,FRANCES,They'll mend.
30379,L221408,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
30380,L221407,u955,m62,FRANCES,...Not if I can help it.
30381,L221406,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,Aren't you ever going back?
30382,L221405,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No, I don't hate it."
30383,L221404,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,You sound as if you hate it.
30384,L221403,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you."
30385,L221402,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,Why?
30386,L221401,u955,m62,FRANCES,Then don't go to Hollywood.
30387,L221400,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,Why... yes.
30388,L221399,u955,m62,FRANCES,Are you really serious? About acting?
30389,L221398,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,"Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!"
30390,L221397,u955,m62,FRANCES,Are you an actor?
30391,L221396,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,"Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood."
30392,L221395,u955,m62,FRANCES,I wouldn't miss it.
30393,L221394,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,Only if you were in it. Are you?
30394,L221393,u955,m62,FRANCES,You can always come see it in London.
30395,L221392,u969,m62,YOUNG MAN,I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
30396,L222079,u956,m62,HARRY,Just a little way.
30397,L222078,u955,m62,FRANCES,That would be okay.
30398,L222077,u956,m62,HARRY,Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
30399,L222076,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again."
30400,L222075,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No, we're not."
30401,L222074,u956,m62,HARRY,No.
30402,L222073,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?"
30403,L222072,u956,m62,HARRY,I'm not sure.
30404,L222071,u955,m62,FRANCES,"It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?"
30405,L222068,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but..."
30406,L222067,u956,m62,HARRY,Why do you say that?
30407,L222066,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry..."
30408,L222065,u956,m62,HARRY,"Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that."
30409,L222064,u955,m62,FRANCES,I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
30410,L222063,u955,m62,FRANCES,Well... you're looking well.
30411,L222062,u956,m62,HARRY,"Oh, you...  ...ennh."
30412,L222061,u955,m62,FRANCES,How did I look?
30413,L222060,u956,m62,HARRY,"Sure I did, that's why I'm here."
30414,L222059,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?"
30415,L222058,u956,m62,HARRY,"How... how ya doin', Farmer?"
30416,L222057,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you."
30417,L222056,u956,m62,HARRY,C'mere. I want to talk to you.
30418,L221970,u956,m62,HARRY,"I hope so, Frances."
30419,L221969,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will."
30420,L221968,u956,m62,HARRY,Right. Except... time has a way of --
30421,L221967,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes."
30422,L221966,u956,m62,HARRY,I don't know.
30423,L221965,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?"
30424,L221964,u956,m62,HARRY,"Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap."
30425,L221962,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl."
30426,L221961,u956,m62,HARRY,You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
30427,L221960,u955,m62,FRANCES,Yeah. I don't know.
30428,L221959,u956,m62,HARRY,"This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it."
30429,L221958,u955,m62,FRANCES,Oh Harry...
30430,L221957,u956,m62,HARRY,Where to?
30431,L221938,u956,m62,HARRY,"I love you too, Frances."
30432,L221937,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I love you, Harry. I love you."
30433,L221917,u955,m62,FRANCES,"...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig."
30434,L221916,u956,m62,HARRY,"Frances, it's me, Harry?"
30435,L221915,u955,m62,FRANCES,Who?
30436,L221914,u956,m62,HARRY,Frances! Frances!
30437,L221794,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I got your number, Mister Man."
30438,L221793,u956,m62,HARRY,Anyway... if you need me...
30439,L221792,u955,m62,FRANCES,I know. Don't tell anyone.
30440,L221791,u956,m62,HARRY,"Frances, You're crazy."
30441,L221790,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess."
30442,L221789,u956,m62,HARRY,You give up on her?
30443,L221788,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy."
30444,L221787,u956,m62,HARRY,"It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing."
30445,L221786,u956,m62,HARRY,Will you marry me?
30446,L221785,u955,m62,FRANCES,What's that?
30447,L221784,u956,m62,HARRY,There's just one more thing.
30448,L221783,u956,m62,HARRY,Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
30449,L221782,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?"
30450,L221781,u956,m62,HARRY,"Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?"
30451,L221780,u955,m62,FRANCES,You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
30452,L221779,u956,m62,HARRY,Huh?
30453,L221778,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Why are you always leaving me, Harry?"
30454,L221775,u956,m62,HARRY,No. To thoroughbreds.
30455,L221774,u955,m62,FRANCES,To quarter-horses.
30456,L221773,u956,m62,HARRY,"Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground."
30457,L221772,u955,m62,FRANCES,What a man!
30458,L221771,u956,m62,HARRY,Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
30459,L221770,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!"
30460,L221769,u955,m62,FRANCES,You can't drink.
30461,L221768,u956,m62,HARRY,What's that?
30462,L221767,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you."
30463,L221766,u956,m62,HARRY,I guess.
30464,L221765,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You know something, Harry?"
30465,L221764,u956,m62,HARRY,"Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!"
30466,L221763,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all."
30467,L221762,u956,m62,HARRY,"Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her."
30468,L221761,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama."
30469,L221759,u955,m62,FRANCES,"A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers."
30470,L221758,u956,m62,HARRY,Huh?
30471,L221757,u955,m62,FRANCES,I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
30472,L221756,u956,m62,HARRY,Whattaya think you're in now?
30473,L221755,u955,m62,FRANCES,I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
30474,L221754,u955,m62,FRANCES,...Take advantage of me.
30475,L221753,u956,m62,HARRY,That's right.
30476,L221752,u955,m62,FRANCES,This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
30477,L221751,u956,m62,HARRY,What?
30478,L221750,u955,m62,FRANCES,I should've known...
30479,L221749,u956,m62,HARRY,Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
30480,L221748,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Where are we, mean man?"
30481,L221747,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?"
30482,L221746,u956,m62,HARRY,"Forget it, Frances. You're not driving."
30483,L221745,u955,m62,FRANCES,That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
30484,L221744,u956,m62,HARRY,"Evening, gorgeous."
30485,L221731,u956,m62,HARRY,You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
30486,L221730,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Oh my God, I look awful."
30487,L221556,u955,m62,FRANCES,Who said I was a lady?
30488,L221555,u956,m62,HARRY,"Take a walk, pal."
30489,L221549,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze."
30490,L221548,u956,m62,HARRY,And?
30491,L221547,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good."
30492,L221545,u956,m62,HARRY,You're coming.
30493,L221544,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No, Harry, I can't --"
30494,L221543,u956,m62,HARRY,"Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?"
30495,L221541,u956,m62,HARRY,Beats me.
30496,L221540,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?"
30497,L221539,u956,m62,HARRY,"So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?"
30498,L221538,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt."
30499,L221537,u956,m62,HARRY,I'll bet.
30500,L221536,u955,m62,FRANCES,I took the early rounds.
30501,L221535,u956,m62,HARRY,"Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops."
30502,L221534,u956,m62,HARRY,"Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it."
30503,L221533,u955,m62,FRANCES,For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
30504,L221532,u956,m62,HARRY,What for?
30505,L221531,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry."
30506,L221530,u956,m62,HARRY,Nice joint. Can you afford it?
30507,L221528,u955,m62,FRANCES,Help yourself. Everyone else has.
30508,L221527,u956,m62,HARRY,Think I'll have a glass.
30509,L221526,u955,m62,FRANCES,What's left of my blood.
30510,L221525,u956,m62,HARRY,Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
30511,L221524,u955,m62,FRANCES,How the hell do you find me anyway?
30512,L221463,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!"
30513,L221462,u956,m62,HARRY,Frances...
30514,L221461,u955,m62,FRANCES,Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
30515,L221460,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!"
30516,L221459,u956,m62,HARRY,"Calm down, Frances."
30517,L221458,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard."
30518,L221457,u956,m62,HARRY,"Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?"
30519,L221456,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Harry? Harry, where are you?!"
30520,L221291,u955,m62,FRANCES,I know.
30521,L221290,u956,m62,HARRY,"I'm serious, Frances. This is important."
30522,L221289,u955,m62,FRANCES,He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
30523,L221288,u956,m62,HARRY,The chauffeur. He's watching.
30524,L221287,u955,m62,FRANCES,"It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving."
30525,L221286,u956,m62,HARRY,"Don't start, Farmer."
30526,L221284,u956,m62,HARRY,"Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits."
30527,L221283,u955,m62,FRANCES,"The hell you will, Harry York."
30528,L221282,u956,m62,HARRY,Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
30529,L221281,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself."
30530,L221280,u956,m62,HARRY,"What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?"
30531,L221279,u955,m62,FRANCES,But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
30532,L221278,u956,m62,HARRY,"Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better."
30533,L221277,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?"
30534,L221276,u956,m62,HARRY,"Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything."
30535,L221275,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No, they don't, do they?"
30536,L221274,u956,m62,HARRY,"If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?"
30537,L221273,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it."
30538,L221272,u955,m62,FRANCES,Forget it.
30539,L221271,u956,m62,HARRY,"Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid."
30540,L221270,u955,m62,FRANCES,Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
30541,L221269,u956,m62,HARRY,You're telling me.
30542,L221268,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --"
30543,L221267,u956,m62,HARRY,Is that why you did it?
30544,L221266,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Well, the studio told me not to."
30545,L221265,u956,m62,HARRY,Shit. I meant the other way around.
30546,L221210,u956,m62,HARRY,"Hey that's great, Farmer, just great."
30547,L221209,u955,m62,FRANCES,Yeah.
30548,L221208,u956,m62,HARRY,"Serious, huh?"
30549,L221205,u956,m62,HARRY,Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
30550,L221204,u955,m62,FRANCES,Harry... I met someone.
30551,L221203,u956,m62,HARRY,"Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake."
30552,L221202,u955,m62,FRANCES,I know what ability you're interested in.
30553,L221201,u956,m62,HARRY,"I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability."
30554,L221200,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now."
30555,L221199,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here."
30556,L221198,u956,m62,HARRY,"He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?"
30557,L221197,u955,m62,FRANCES,"But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?"
30558,L221196,u956,m62,HARRY,Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
30559,L221195,u955,m62,FRANCES,Jesus.
30560,L221194,u956,m62,HARRY,Eight stories.
30561,L221193,u955,m62,FRANCES,Oh no...
30562,L221192,u956,m62,HARRY,They killed him. They threw him out that window.
30563,L221191,u955,m62,FRANCES,What?
30564,L221190,u956,m62,HARRY,"Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid."
30565,L221189,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide."
30566,L221188,u956,m62,HARRY,Kaminski.
30567,L221187,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?"
30568,L221186,u956,m62,HARRY,Came to get a tan.
30569,L221185,u955,m62,FRANCES,Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
30570,L221184,u956,m62,HARRY,"How ya doin', Farmer?"
30571,L221111,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters."
30572,L221110,u956,m62,HARRY,Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
30573,L221109,u955,m62,FRANCES,What?
30574,L221108,u956,m62,HARRY,Frances...
30575,L221106,u955,m62,FRANCES,Yeah.
30576,L221105,u956,m62,HARRY,You don't know what you want.
30577,L221104,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many..."
30578,L221103,u956,m62,HARRY,Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
30579,L221102,u955,m62,FRANCES,...So you think I should go.
30580,L221101,u956,m62,HARRY,"I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life."
30581,L221100,u956,m62,HARRY,He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
30582,L221099,u955,m62,FRANCES,What happened to him?
30583,L221098,u956,m62,HARRY,"You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there."
30584,L221097,u956,m62,HARRY,"You're not the quiet type, Frances."
30585,L221096,u955,m62,FRANCES,Quietly.
30586,L221095,u956,m62,HARRY,What?
30587,L221094,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it..."
30588,L221093,u956,m62,HARRY,"Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it."
30589,L221092,u955,m62,FRANCES,I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
30590,L221091,u956,m62,HARRY,"Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid."
30591,L221089,u956,m62,HARRY,You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
30592,L221088,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Don't be a rat, Harry."
30593,L221087,u956,m62,HARRY,Enh.
30594,L221086,u955,m62,FRANCES,How'd I look?
30595,L221085,u956,m62,HARRY,I just wanted to see how you looked.
30596,L221084,u955,m62,FRANCES,Well? What'd you think?
30597,L221083,u956,m62,HARRY,You think I'd miss it?
30598,L221082,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?"
30599,L221014,u955,m62,FRANCES,Harry.
30600,L221013,u956,m62,HARRY,Harry.
30601,L221012,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York."
30602,L221011,u956,m62,HARRY,"I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut."
30603,L221010,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose."
30604,L221009,u956,m62,HARRY,Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
30605,L221008,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess."
30606,L221007,u956,m62,HARRY,"Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy."
30607,L221006,u955,m62,FRANCES,But I'm not. The newspapers're --
30608,L221005,u956,m62,HARRY,"Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --"
30609,L221004,u955,m62,FRANCES,Whattaya mean?
30610,L221003,u956,m62,HARRY,"Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?"
30611,L221002,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski..."
30612,L221001,u956,m62,HARRY,"Yeah, well --"
30613,L221000,u955,m62,FRANCES,Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
30614,L220999,u956,m62,HARRY,"Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here."
30615,L220998,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?"
30616,L220996,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No... Actually, you look more like a cop."
30617,L220995,u956,m62,HARRY,"Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?"
30618,L220994,u955,m62,FRANCES,Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
30619,L220993,u956,m62,HARRY,Not me. But other people seem to.
30620,L220992,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?"
30621,L220991,u956,m62,HARRY,"Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?"
30622,L220990,u955,m62,FRANCES,Okay then...
30623,L220989,u956,m62,HARRY,I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
30624,L220988,u955,m62,FRANCES,Don't touch me.
30625,L220987,u956,m62,HARRY,"Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!"
30626,L221990,u957,m62,HITCHHIKER,Run!
30627,L221989,u955,m62,FRANCES,Shit!
30628,L221985,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You know, I've never been able to figure that out."
30629,L221984,u957,m62,HITCHHIKER,What'd you do?
30630,L221983,u955,m62,FRANCES,Yeah.
30631,L221980,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until..."
30632,L221979,u957,m62,HITCHHIKER,"Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?"
30633,L221978,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Wherever they're going, I'm going."
30634,L221977,u957,m62,HITCHHIKER,Where you goin'?
30635,L221976,u955,m62,FRANCES,Yes.
30636,L221975,u957,m62,HITCHHIKER,And no people.
30637,L221974,u955,m62,FRANCES,It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
30638,L221973,u957,m62,HITCHHIKER,Pretty morning.
30639,L221618,u958,m62,JUDGE,You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
30640,L221617,u955,m62,FRANCES,Fine!
30641,L221616,u958,m62,JUDGE,"Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail."
30642,L221612,u958,m62,JUDGE,"Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --"
30643,L221611,u955,m62,FRANCES,Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
30644,L221610,u958,m62,JUDGE,"Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?"
30645,L221609,u955,m62,FRANCES,"That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?"
30646,L221608,u958,m62,JUDGE,"You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady."
30647,L221607,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face..."
30648,L221606,u958,m62,JUDGE,Did you expect him to look you up?
30649,L221605,u955,m62,FRANCES,I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
30650,L221604,u958,m62,JUDGE,Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
30651,L221603,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No, I couldn't get my hands on one."
30652,L221602,u958,m62,JUDGE,Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
30653,L221601,u955,m62,FRANCES,Who's writing this guy's lines?
30654,L221600,u958,m62,JUDGE,...Is that not true?
30655,L221565,u963,m62,MAN,"I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow."
30656,L221564,u955,m62,FRANCES,What?
30657,L221563,u963,m62,MAN,"You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think."
30658,L221562,u955,m62,FRANCES,I live here.
30659,L221561,u963,m62,MAN,Who're you?
30660,L221560,u955,m62,FRANCES,What happened? Who're you?
30661,L221428,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it."
30662,L221427,u964,m62,ODETS,You got it.
30663,L221426,u955,m62,FRANCES,You think I got it?
30664,L221425,u964,m62,ODETS,The speech? Real good.
30665,L221424,u955,m62,FRANCES,How's it sound?
30666,L221423,u964,m62,ODETS,I already have.
30667,L221422,u955,m62,FRANCES,"'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, ""This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!"" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'"
30668,L221421,u964,m62,ODETS,Your big speech?
30669,L221420,u955,m62,FRANCES,'But how do I know you love me?'
30670,L221362,u964,m62,ODETS,"Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you."
30671,L221361,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!"
30672,L221360,u964,m62,ODETS,I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
30673,L221359,u955,m62,FRANCES,But I want to. I'm trying!
30674,L221358,u964,m62,ODETS,"Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!"
30675,L221357,u955,m62,FRANCES,I'm not!
30676,L221356,u964,m62,ODETS,"I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --"
30677,L221355,u955,m62,FRANCES,"That's me, Clifford."
30678,L221350,u964,m62,ODETS,'Golden Boy.'
30679,L221349,u955,m62,FRANCES,And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
30680,L222009,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready."
30681,L222008,u962,m62,LILLIAN,But what --
30682,L222007,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!"
30683,L222006,u962,m62,LILLIAN,I have!
30684,L222005,u955,m62,FRANCES,You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
30685,L222004,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"I was hoping for a kind word, little sister."
30686,L222003,u955,m62,FRANCES,Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
30687,L221955,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I will, I promise."
30688,L221954,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway."
30689,L221953,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Thank you for understanding, Mama."
30690,L221952,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back."
30691,L221951,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning."
30692,L221950,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"Oh, just leave those things for now."
30693,L221945,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No. No, it all depends on what offers I get."
30694,L221944,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind."
30695,L221864,u962,m62,LILLIAN,Frances!
30696,L221863,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life."
30697,L221862,u962,m62,LILLIAN,You're not going anywhere!
30698,L221861,u955,m62,FRANCES,I'm going out!
30699,L221860,u962,m62,LILLIAN,Where are you going?
30700,L221859,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would."
30701,L221858,u962,m62,LILLIAN,And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
30702,L221857,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Mama, shut up!"
30703,L221856,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!"
30704,L221855,u955,m62,FRANCES,No!
30705,L221854,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say."
30706,L221853,u955,m62,FRANCES,I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
30707,L221852,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!"
30708,L221851,u955,m62,FRANCES,Haven't you heard what I said?
30709,L221850,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!"
30710,L221849,u955,m62,FRANCES,Mama...?
30711,L221848,u962,m62,LILLIAN,Don't... talk crazy.
30712,L221847,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you."
30713,L221846,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --"
30714,L221845,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I'm back, Mama."
30715,L221833,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yes, Mama."
30716,L221832,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"I don't want you drinking, Frances."
30717,L221831,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yes, Mama."
30718,L221830,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister."
30719,L221829,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I promise I'll... I promise, Mama."
30720,L221828,u962,m62,LILLIAN,Say you promise.
30721,L221827,u955,m62,FRANCES,Sure.
30722,L221826,u962,m62,LILLIAN,At one. Promise?
30723,L221825,u955,m62,FRANCES,I'll be back.
30724,L221824,u962,m62,LILLIAN,I'll have lunch ready by one.
30725,L221823,u955,m62,FRANCES,Not long.
30726,L221822,u962,m62,LILLIAN,How long will you be?
30727,L221821,u955,m62,FRANCES,"For a walk, Mama. Just a walk."
30728,L221820,u962,m62,LILLIAN,Where are you going?
30729,L221819,u955,m62,FRANCES,Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
30730,L221818,u962,m62,LILLIAN,What's wrong?
30731,L221817,u955,m62,FRANCES,I think I need a little air.
30732,L221815,u962,m62,LILLIAN,Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
30733,L221814,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song."
30734,L221797,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?"
30735,L221796,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Well, who have we here...?"
30736,L221700,u955,m62,FRANCES,Go on...
30737,L221699,u962,m62,LILLIAN,What?
30738,L221698,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You kill me, Mama."
30739,L221697,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"It's your fan mail, little sister."
30740,L221696,u955,m62,FRANCES,Then why did you bring them?
30741,L221695,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now."
30742,L221694,u955,m62,FRANCES,Why are these all opened?
30743,L221693,u962,m62,LILLIAN,And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
30744,L221686,u955,m62,FRANCES,Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
30745,L221685,u962,m62,LILLIAN,Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
30746,L221638,u955,m62,FRANCES,You're taking me home!
30747,L221637,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need."
30748,L221636,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Mama, what's..."
30749,L221635,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine."
30750,L221249,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"Smile, little sister, smile."
30751,L221248,u955,m62,FRANCES,It's okay.
30752,L221124,u962,m62,LILLIAN,...You will.
30753,L221123,u955,m62,FRANCES,I don't care.
30754,L221122,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --"
30755,L221121,u955,m62,FRANCES,"It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life."
30756,L221117,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Oh, Mama, don't you understand?"
30757,L221116,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --"
30758,L221115,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York."
30759,L221114,u962,m62,LILLIAN,But they're using you!
30760,L221050,u962,m62,LILLIAN,And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
30761,L221049,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Yes, Ma."
30762,L221048,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?"
30763,L221031,u962,m62,LILLIAN,"I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration."
30764,L221030,u955,m62,FRANCES,Mama...
30765,L221261,u955,m62,FRANCES,Oh bullshit.
30766,L221260,u959,m62,JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE,"No, my dear. You must be mistaken."
30767,L221259,u955,m62,FRANCES,Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
30768,L221258,u959,m62,JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE,I don't believe so.
30769,L221257,u955,m62,FRANCES,Don't I know you?
30770,L221256,u959,m62,JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE,Yes...?
30771,L221255,u955,m62,FRANCES,Excuse me.
30772,L221254,u959,m62,JUDGE HILLIER'S WIFE,"On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --"
30773,L221728,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,Sedate her.
30774,L221727,u955,m62,FRANCES,Symington says...
30775,L221725,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!"
30776,L221724,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,"Frances, I'm warning you..."
30777,L221723,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!"
30778,L221722,u955,m62,FRANCES,"'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!"
30779,L221721,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,Huh?
30780,L221720,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?"
30781,L221719,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
30782,L221718,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,"Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?"
30783,L221717,u955,m62,FRANCES,You what?
30784,L221716,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,"Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review."
30785,L221715,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty."
30786,L221714,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
30787,L221713,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all."
30788,L221712,u955,m62,FRANCES,Oh for Christ's...
30789,L221711,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
30790,L221710,u955,m62,FRANCES,"I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said..."
30791,L221709,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,"She told me you said, ""Mama, you want to kill me."""
30792,L221708,u955,m62,FRANCES,What?
30793,L221707,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
30794,L221706,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all."
30795,L221705,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,You're telling me you feel guilty.
30796,L221704,u955,m62,FRANCES,Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
30797,L221703,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,Really? Any problems?
30798,L221702,u955,m62,FRANCES,Yes. It was very good to see her.
30799,L221701,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,"...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?"
30800,L221678,u955,m62,FRANCES,You didn't say 'Symington says'.
30801,L221677,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,Is there something else?
30802,L221675,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away."
30803,L221674,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,I'll have someone show you to your room.
30804,L221673,u955,m62,FRANCES,"No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, ""Doctor?"""
30805,L221672,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,"Stay calm, please."
30806,L221671,u955,m62,FRANCES,This whole thing is a joke!
30807,L221670,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,"Just a little joke, Miss Farmer."
30808,L221669,u955,m62,FRANCES,...Did you really say that?
30809,L221668,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
30810,L221667,u955,m62,FRANCES,Normal. Average.
30811,L221666,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,And what's that?
30812,L221665,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me."
30813,L221664,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,I see.
30814,L221663,u955,m62,FRANCES,"You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian."
30815,L221662,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,Please sit down...
30816,L221661,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?"
30817,L221660,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,"Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which..."
30818,L221659,u955,m62,FRANCES,Oh! Are you really?
30819,L221657,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Why, Doctor! We've only just met!"
30820,L221656,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
30821,L221655,u955,m62,FRANCES,It ain't for lack of trying.
30822,L221654,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
30823,L221653,u955,m62,FRANCES,"Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'."
30824,L221652,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,Thanks are hardly necessary.
30825,L221651,u955,m62,FRANCES,Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
30826,L221650,u967,m62,SYMINGTON,I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
30827,L220977,u960,m62,KAMINSKI,"Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!"
30828,L220976,u968,m62,YORK & CROWD,No! No!
30829,L220975,u960,m62,KAMINSKI,Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
30830,L220974,u968,m62,YORK & CROWD,No!
30831,L220973,u960,m62,KAMINSKI,"Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?"
30832,L220972,u968,m62,YORK & CROWD,No!
30833,L220971,u960,m62,KAMINSKI,And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
30834,L222021,u965,m62,OLDER NURSE,'Incurable.'
30835,L222020,u970,m62,YOUNG NURSE,What?
30836,L222019,u965,m62,OLDER NURSE,"Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word."
30837,L222018,u970,m62,YOUNG NURSE,You're kidding.
30838,L222017,u965,m62,OLDER NURSE,I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
30839,L222016,u970,m62,YOUNG NURSE,Yeah?
30840,L222015,u965,m62,OLDER NURSE,I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
30841,L222770,u971,m63,CREATURE,Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
30842,L222769,u982,m63,WALTON,What kindness?

30844,L222766,u971,m63,CREATURE,Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
30845,L222765,u982,m63,WALTON,Then why weep for him?
30846,L222764,u971,m63,CREATURE,And he drove me to mine.
30847,L222763,u982,m63,WALTON,You drove him to his torment.
30848,L222762,u971,m63,CREATURE,I am as he made me. In his own image.
30849,L222761,u982,m63,WALTON,What is that to you? Evil as you are.
30850,L222760,u971,m63,CREATURE,I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
30851,L222759,u971,m63,CREATURE,I was watching.
30852,L222758,u982,m63,WALTON,Yes.

30854,L222502,u971,m63,CREATURE,I am afraid.

30867,L222488,u974,m63,GRANDFATHER,I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
30868,L222487,u974,m63,GRANDFATHER,The music? Or the fire?

30890,L222637,u971,m63,CREATURE,"I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine.

30900,L222627,u971,m63,CREATURE,In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.

30953,L222710,u980,m63,VICTOR,I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
30954,L222709,u980,m63,VICTOR,Now husband and wife.
30955,L222708,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Brother and sister no more.
30956,L222686,u980,m63,VICTOR,I do. But you must trust me for now.
30957,L222685,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,"Victor, tell me why! Trust me!"
30958,L222684,u980,m63,VICTOR,Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
30959,L222683,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
30960,L222682,u980,m63,VICTOR,"We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need."
30961,L222681,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,It is
30962,L222680,u980,m63,VICTOR,It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
30963,L222679,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Why the change? What about your work?
30964,L222678,u980,m63,VICTOR,"No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today."
30965,L222655,u980,m63,VICTOR,"A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done."
30966,L222654,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,"We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude."
30967,L222653,u980,m63,VICTOR,So do I.
30968,L222652,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,"What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again."
30969,L222651,u980,m63,VICTOR,It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
30970,L222650,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,What sort of task?
30971,L222644,u980,m63,VICTOR,"I'm all right. I'm safe,"
30972,L222643,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,I thought I'd never see you again!
30973,L222599,u980,m63,VICTOR,I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
30974,L222598,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
30975,L222597,u980,m63,VICTOR,They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
30976,L222596,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,"If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!"
30977,L222595,u980,m63,VICTOR,I've no choice
30978,L222594,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
30979,L222593,u980,m63,VICTOR,My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
30980,L222223,u980,m63,VICTOR,Elizabeth. My more than sister.
30981,L222222,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,"Victor. I love you,"
30982,L222221,u980,m63,VICTOR,...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
30983,L222220,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,I give you my soul...
30984,L222219,u980,m63,VICTOR,Your decision. For us.
30985,L222218,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Our decision. Together.
30986,L222217,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Not as weak as I.
30987,L222216,u980,m63,VICTOR,You make me weak.
30988,L222213,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,I will be here when you return.
30989,L222212,u980,m63,VICTOR,Only you.
30990,L222211,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
30991,L222210,u980,m63,VICTOR,Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
30992,L222209,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,I wish to be your wife.
30993,L222208,u980,m63,VICTOR,I wish to be your husband.
30994,L222207,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Brother and sister still?
30995,L222206,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Is that what makes it so delicious?
30996,L222205,u980,m63,VICTOR,This feels... incestuous.
30997,L222204,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,All my life I've known.
30998,L222203,u980,m63,VICTOR,I've loved you all my life
30999,L222200,u980,m63,VICTOR,To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
31000,L222199,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,"You will.  What do you want, Victor?"
31001,L222198,u980,m63,VICTOR,I'll have to do better than that.
31002,L222197,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
31003,L222196,u980,m63,VICTOR,And you?
31004,L222195,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Father's so proud.
31005,L222194,u980,m63,VICTOR,"Quite a send-off, isn't it?"
31006,L222193,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Smell the air. Wonderful.
31007,L222178,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
31008,L222177,u980,m63,VICTOR,"Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!"
31009,L222174,u980,m63,VICTOR,"He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?"
31010,L222173,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,"Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!"
31011,L222172,u980,m63,VICTOR,The world is a dizzying place.
31012,L222171,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,"Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!"
31013,L222167,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
31014,L222166,u980,m63,VICTOR,God took her from us.
31015,L222165,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
31016,L222164,u980,m63,VICTOR,What kind of God is He to will this?
31017,L222163,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
31018,L222162,u980,m63,VICTOR,How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
31019,L222145,u980,m63,VICTOR,Nothing can. Not ever.
31020,L222144,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Are you sure it can't hurt us?
31021,L222142,u972,m63,ELIZABETH,Aren't you?
31022,L222141,u980,m63,VICTOR,"Don't cry, Elizabeth."
31023,L222754,u975,m63,GRIGORI,"Aye, Captain."
31024,L222753,u982,m63,WALTON,"He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin."
31025,L222752,u975,m63,GRIGORI,This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
31026,L222751,u982,m63,WALTON,A warming wind.
31027,L222109,u975,m63,GRIGORI,Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
31028,L222108,u982,m63,WALTON,They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
31029,L222107,u975,m63,GRIGORI,"Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance."
31030,L222085,u982,m63,WALTON,It wouldn't dare.
31031,L222084,u975,m63,GRIGORI,It's going to ram us.
31032,L222354,u981,m63,WALDMAN,Oh God.
31033,L222353,u976,m63,HENRY,Professor?
31034,L222337,u976,m63,HENRY,Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
31035,L222336,u981,m63,WALDMAN,No. But someday.
31036,L222335,u976,m63,HENRY,Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
31037,L222334,u981,m63,WALDMAN,"I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets."
31038,L222333,u976,m63,HENRY,You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
31039,L222332,u981,m63,WALDMAN,"I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of."
31040,L222745,u976,m63,HENRY,Let it go.
31041,L222744,u980,m63,VICTOR,All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
31042,L222697,u980,m63,VICTOR,I owe you that. Done.
31043,L222696,u976,m63,HENRY,Only if you'll tell me who he is.
31044,L222695,u980,m63,VICTOR,I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
31045,L222694,u976,m63,HENRY,"Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her."
31046,L222693,u980,m63,VICTOR,Are you sure you'll be all right?
31047,L222646,u980,m63,VICTOR,I didn't find what I was looking for.
31048,L222645,u976,m63,HENRY,What happened up there?
31049,L222553,u980,m63,VICTOR,"This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere."
31050,L222552,u976,m63,HENRY,For what?
31051,L222551,u980,m63,VICTOR,"Thank you, Henry."
31052,L222550,u976,m63,HENRY,Quite a place.
31053,L222435,u976,m63,HENRY,Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
31054,L222434,u980,m63,VICTOR,No. They don't.
31055,L222433,u976,m63,HENRY,It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
31056,L222432,u976,m63,HENRY,"Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein."
31057,L222431,u980,m63,VICTOR,"Everything in moderation, Clerval."
31058,L222430,u976,m63,HENRY,We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
31059,L222429,u980,m63,VICTOR,You've been going round-the-clock?
31060,L222428,u976,m63,HENRY,Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
31061,L222427,u980,m63,VICTOR,Is that your diagnosis?
31062,L222426,u976,m63,HENRY,"We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm."
31063,L222425,u980,m63,VICTOR,A... week?
31064,L222424,u976,m63,HENRY,"Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week."
31065,L222401,u980,m63,VICTOR,"You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye."
31066,L222400,u976,m63,HENRY,Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
31067,L222399,u980,m63,VICTOR,Yes? And?
31068,L222398,u976,m63,HENRY,Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
31069,L222397,u980,m63,VICTOR,"This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?"
31070,L222379,u980,m63,VICTOR,Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
31071,L222378,u976,m63,HENRY,How much longer?
31072,L222377,u980,m63,VICTOR,That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
31073,L222376,u976,m63,HENRY,We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
31074,L222375,u980,m63,VICTOR,I've been preoccupied.
31075,L222374,u976,m63,HENRY,Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
31076,L222369,u976,m63,HENRY,There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
31077,L222368,u980,m63,VICTOR,No. He had more important work.
31078,L222367,u976,m63,HENRY,All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
31079,L222366,u980,m63,VICTOR,Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
31080,L222365,u976,m63,HENRY,That's blasphemy!
31081,L222364,u980,m63,VICTOR,I resent God's monopoly.
31082,L222363,u976,m63,HENRY,You can't. Death is God's will!
31083,L222362,u980,m63,VICTOR,Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
31084,L222361,u976,m63,HENRY,You're making a scene!
31085,L222360,u980,m63,VICTOR,"It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die."
31086,L222359,u976,m63,HENRY,Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
31087,L222358,u980,m63,VICTOR,Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
31088,L222357,u976,m63,HENRY,They'll hang him all the same.
31089,L222356,u980,m63,VICTOR,He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
31090,L222355,u976,m63,HENRY,They just caught the man who did it.
31091,L222343,u980,m63,VICTOR,"Nothing in moderation, Clerval."
31092,L222342,u976,m63,HENRY,"And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein."
31093,L222339,u976,m63,HENRY,Somebody has to!
31094,L222338,u980,m63,VICTOR,Only you would think of that!
31095,L222289,u980,m63,VICTOR,"But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions."
31096,L222288,u976,m63,HENRY,"...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before."
31097,L222287,u980,m63,VICTOR,"These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought"
31098,L222286,u976,m63,HENRY,Now you've got him started.
31099,L222278,u980,m63,VICTOR,It's a letter to my father.
31100,L222277,u976,m63,HENRY,What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
31101,L222276,u980,m63,VICTOR,"You're a comfort to me, Henry."
31102,L222275,u976,m63,HENRY,The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
31103,L222263,u976,m63,HENRY,Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
31104,L222262,u980,m63,VICTOR,Quite a few.
31105,L222261,u976,m63,HENRY,Can you think of a better reason?
31106,L222260,u980,m63,VICTOR,Rich old ladies and their daughters?
31107,L222253,u976,m63,HENRY,"Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak."
31108,L222252,u980,m63,VICTOR,Do you really think I'm mad?
31109,L222251,u976,m63,HENRY,I know. You have a way of making an impression.
31110,L222250,u980,m63,VICTOR,"Victor, Victor Frankenstein."
31111,L222249,u976,m63,HENRY,Henry Clerval.
31112,L222248,u976,m63,HENRY,Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
31113,L222247,u980,m63,VICTOR,Are you having me on?
31114,L222246,u976,m63,HENRY,As a march hare.
31115,L222245,u980,m63,VICTOR,I am not mad.
31116,L222243,u980,m63,VICTOR,Very well then.
31117,L222242,u976,m63,HENRY,I was just clearing my throat.
31118,L222589,u977,m63,JUSTINE,I have no knowledge of that.
31119,L222588,u979,m63,PROSECUTOR,So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
31120,L222587,u977,m63,JUSTINE,"Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind."
31121,L222586,u979,m63,PROSECUTOR,Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
31122,L222585,u977,m63,JUSTINE,I have always loved him.
31123,L222584,u979,m63,PROSECUTOR,"And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?"
31124,L222583,u977,m63,JUSTINE,Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
31125,L222324,u980,m63,VICTOR,Despite the lack of challenge.
31126,L222323,u978,m63,KREMPE,You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
31127,L222239,u978,m63,KREMPE,"Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?"
31128,L222238,u980,m63,VICTOR,"Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva."
31129,L222237,u978,m63,KREMPE,What is your name?
31130,L222236,u980,m63,VICTOR,Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
31131,L222235,u978,m63,KREMPE,Paracelsus?
31132,L222234,u980,m63,VICTOR,"Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one."
31133,L222233,u978,m63,KREMPE,Philosophical?
31134,L222232,u980,m63,VICTOR,"But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works."
31135,L222231,u978,m63,KREMPE,"In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?"
31136,L222341,u981,m63,WALDMAN,"Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor."
31137,L222340,u980,m63,VICTOR,"I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself."
31138,L222326,u980,m63,VICTOR,The strain was evident.
31139,L222325,u981,m63,WALDMAN,Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
31140,L222320,u980,m63,VICTOR,Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
31141,L222319,u981,m63,WALDMAN,Re-configure the leads?
31142,L222306,u981,m63,WALDMAN,Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
31143,L222305,u980,m63,VICTOR,Why?
31144,L222304,u981,m63,WALDMAN,"""...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty."
31145,L222303,u981,m63,WALDMAN,Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
31146,L222302,u980,m63,VICTOR,I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
31147,L222301,u981,m63,WALDMAN,"It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies."
31148,L222300,u980,m63,VICTOR,But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
31149,L222299,u981,m63,WALDMAN,"Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom."
31150,L222298,u980,m63,VICTOR,It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
31151,L222297,u981,m63,WALDMAN,Electricity.
31152,L222294,u981,m63,WALDMAN,"I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since."
31153,L222293,u980,m63,VICTOR,Preposterous.
31154,L222285,u980,m63,VICTOR,"No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known."
31155,L222284,u981,m63,WALDMAN,You disdain accepted wisdom?
31156,L222283,u980,m63,VICTOR,"To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new."
31157,L222282,u981,m63,WALDMAN,You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
31158,L222281,u980,m63,VICTOR,Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
31159,L222280,u981,m63,WALDMAN,"Victor, explain yourself."
31160,L222279,u980,m63,VICTOR,Professor Waldman.
31161,L222131,u980,m63,VICTOR,My name is Frankenstein...
31162,L222130,u982,m63,WALTON,Who are you?
31163,L222129,u980,m63,VICTOR,"We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man."
31164,L222128,u982,m63,WALTON,Madness?
31165,L222127,u980,m63,VICTOR,Do you share my madness?
31166,L222126,u982,m63,WALTON,"Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on."
31167,L222125,u980,m63,VICTOR,You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
31168,L222124,u982,m63,WALTON,"Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune."
31169,L222123,u980,m63,VICTOR,Your men are right to be afraid.
31170,L222122,u982,m63,WALTON,You know of it?
31171,L222121,u980,m63,VICTOR,Creature? A... human like creature?
31172,L222120,u982,m63,WALTON,I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
31173,L222119,u980,m63,VICTOR,I heard.
31174,L222118,u982,m63,WALTON,Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
31175,L222117,u980,m63,VICTOR,Ah. An explorer.
31176,L222116,u982,m63,WALTON,"There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole."
31177,L222115,u980,m63,VICTOR,How is it you come to be here?
31178,L222114,u982,m63,WALTON,Are you a physician?
31179,L222113,u980,m63,VICTOR,Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
31180,L222112,u980,m63,VICTOR,I'm... dying.
31181,L222111,u982,m63,WALTON,You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
31182,L225234,u983,m64,ALICE,Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
31183,L225233,u990,m64,MRS. VOORHEES,We should go now.
31184,L225229,u990,m64,MRS. VOORHEES,I will protect you.
31185,L225228,u983,m64,ALICE,The killer is still out there.
31186,L225226,u983,m64,ALICE,Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
31187,L225225,u990,m64,MRS. VOORHEES,"So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?"
31188,L225219,u983,m64,ALICE,"No, no, they're all dead..."
31189,L225218,u990,m64,MRS. VOORHEES,It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
31190,L225217,u983,m64,ALICE,Jack? Marcie? Ned?
31191,L225216,u990,m64,MRS. VOORHEES,It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
31192,L225215,u983,m64,ALICE,"He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God..."
31193,L225146,u983,m64,ALICE,"Good night, Brenda."
31194,L225145,u986,m64,BRENDA,"Good night, Alice."
31195,L225143,u983,m64,ALICE,I guess...
31196,L225142,u986,m64,BRENDA,"Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway."
31197,L225141,u983,m64,ALICE,I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
31198,L225043,u983,m64,ALICE,I was careless.
31199,L225042,u986,m64,BRENDA,Melvin Belli.
31200,L225034,u986,m64,BRENDA,Right! Right!
31201,L225033,u983,m64,ALICE,Tomorrow is another day.
31202,L225032,u986,m64,BRENDA,Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
31203,L224949,u986,m64,BRENDA,I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
31204,L224948,u983,m64,ALICE,What'd you see?
31205,L224906,u983,m64,ALICE,Sure.
31206,L224905,u993,m64,STEVE,"I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?"
31207,L224904,u993,m64,STEVE,"Thanks, Alice."
31208,L224903,u983,m64,ALICE,Next Friday.
31209,L224902,u993,m64,STEVE,"You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful."
31210,L224901,u983,m64,ALICE,I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
31211,L224900,u993,m64,STEVE,You want to leave?
31212,L224899,u983,m64,ALICE,Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
31213,L224898,u993,m64,STEVE,Any particular reason?
31214,L224896,u983,m64,ALICE,"Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it."
31215,L224895,u993,m64,STEVE,You draw very well.
31216,L224873,u983,m64,ALICE,You told her to sweep the courts.
31217,L224872,u993,m64,STEVE,"That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?"
31218,L224871,u993,m64,STEVE,"Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push."
31219,L224870,u983,m64,ALICE,Cabin B is ready.
31220,L225202,u985,m64,BILL,It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
31221,L225201,u983,m64,ALICE,Why don't we run? Just run now?
31222,L225200,u985,m64,BILL,Wet. I don't know.
31223,L225199,u983,m64,ALICE,What's the matter with it?
31224,L225197,u985,m64,BILL,No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
31225,L225196,u983,m64,ALICE,Do you have a dime? A quarter?
31226,L225195,u985,m64,BILL,It's dead. Try the pay phone.
31227,L225190,u985,m64,BILL,"Hey, guys!"
31228,L225189,u983,m64,ALICE,Marcie?
31229,L225188,u985,m64,BILL,Jack?
31230,L225167,u983,m64,ALICE,Okay.
31231,L225166,u985,m64,BILL,I'll go check on Brenda.
31232,L225165,u983,m64,ALICE,They're off now.
31233,L225164,u985,m64,BILL,Where?
31234,L225163,u983,m64,ALICE,Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
31235,L225162,u985,m64,BILL,I'll go take a look.
31236,L225161,u983,m64,ALICE,It sounded like Brenda.
31237,L225160,u985,m64,BILL,Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
31238,L225159,u983,m64,ALICE,I don't hear it anymore.
31239,L225148,u983,m64,ALICE,Absolutely.
31240,L225147,u985,m64,BILL,Help you clean up?
31241,L225139,u983,m64,ALICE,"Well, it hasn't been that long."
31242,L225138,u985,m64,BILL,Good point.
31243,L225137,u983,m64,ALICE,It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
31244,L225102,u985,m64,BILL,Not if they're where I think they are.
31245,L225101,u983,m64,ALICE,Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
31246,L225007,u983,m64,ALICE,Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
31247,L225006,u985,m64,BILL,Trouble?
31248,L224974,u985,m64,BILL,Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
31249,L224973,u983,m64,ALICE,How the... did he get in there?
31250,L224965,u983,m64,ALICE,And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
31251,L224964,u985,m64,BILL,You can only do what you can do.
31252,L224962,u985,m64,BILL,Almost five.
31253,L224961,u983,m64,ALICE,I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
31254,L224953,u983,m64,ALICE,I don't know.
31255,L224952,u985,m64,BILL,What'll you do when you leave here?
31256,L224951,u983,m64,ALICE,"I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife."
31257,L224950,u985,m64,BILL,It still hurts?
31258,L224942,u983,m64,ALICE,Artist.
31259,L224941,u985,m64,BILL,Filmmaker.
31260,L224932,u985,m64,BILL,You're right. It makes no sense.
31261,L224931,u983,m64,ALICE,"And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me."
31262,L224930,u985,m64,BILL,Maybe I can help?
31263,L224929,u983,m64,ALICE,It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
31264,L224928,u985,m64,BILL,How come you're leaving?
31265,L224926,u985,m64,BILL,You okay?
31266,L224925,u983,m64,ALICE,"Oh, my God..."
31267,L224924,u983,m64,ALICE,Un-hunh.
31268,L224923,u985,m64,BILL,Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
31269,L224883,u983,m64,ALICE,I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
31270,L224882,u985,m64,BILL,You think you're gonna last all summer?
31271,L224881,u983,m64,ALICE,Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
31272,L224880,u985,m64,BILL,Alice? The others show up?
31273,L224878,u985,m64,BILL,I finished the boats.
31274,L224877,u983,m64,ALICE,Steve said for you to start on the boats.
31275,L225068,u983,m64,ALICE,You're welcome.
31276,L225067,u991,m64,NED,"I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice."
31277,L225066,u983,m64,ALICE,Sure.
31278,L225064,u983,m64,ALICE,"Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?"
31279,L225063,u991,m64,NED,I'm sorry.
31280,L224957,u991,m64,NED,"Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out..."
31281,L224956,u983,m64,ALICE,I'll be along.
31282,L224911,u991,m64,NED,Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
31283,L224910,u983,m64,ALICE,How come?
31284,L224813,u984,m64,BARRY,"I need you so much, Claudette."
31285,L224812,u987,m64,CLAUDETTE,"Let's go back, Barry..."
31286,L224811,u984,m64,BARRY,"Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone."
31287,L224810,u987,m64,CLAUDETTE,"Somebody's there, Barry."
31288,L224809,u984,m64,BARRY,"No, they won't..."
31289,L224808,u987,m64,CLAUDETTE,Somebody'll see.
31290,L224807,u984,m64,BARRY,Claudette...
31291,L224806,u987,m64,CLAUDETTE,"Oh, you..."
31292,L224805,u984,m64,BARRY,I wouldn't know.
31293,L224802,u987,m64,CLAUDETTE,"I can't, Barry..."
31294,L224801,u984,m64,BARRY,"You know what I said, though."
31295,L224800,u984,m64,BARRY,I meant everything.
31296,L224799,u987,m64,CLAUDETTE,You said we were special.
31297,L225072,u985,m64,BILL,Where's Ned?
31298,L225071,u988,m64,JACK,You just had some lucky shots.
31299,L225061,u988,m64,JACK,I'll spot you five points.
31300,L225060,u985,m64,BILL,Chance to get even?
31301,L225055,u988,m64,JACK,Get behind him more.
31302,L225054,u985,m64,BILL,Roll him over!
31303,L225051,u985,m64,BILL,Is it stuck?
31304,L225050,u988,m64,JACK,What is it?
31305,L225024,u985,m64,BILL,A short somewhere.
31306,L225023,u988,m64,JACK,Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
31307,L225020,u985,m64,BILL,I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
31308,L225019,u988,m64,JACK,Thanks.
31309,L225018,u985,m64,BILL,I had to.
31310,L225017,u988,m64,JACK,You saved my life.
31311,L225016,u985,m64,BILL,Don't get up. Take a second...
31312,L225015,u988,m64,JACK,I'll be okay. Holy shit...
31313,L225013,u988,m64,JACK,Here we go.
31314,L225012,u985,m64,BILL,This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
31315,L225011,u985,m64,BILL,For sure.
31316,L225010,u988,m64,JACK,Give me a hand?
31317,L224990,u985,m64,BILL,Where'd you get that stuff?
31318,L224989,u988,m64,JACK,What the hell?
31319,L225029,u991,m64,NED,"Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was ""Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you."" ""What hath God wrought"" was the telegraph."
31320,L225028,u986,m64,BRENDA,That was the telephone.
31321,L225027,u991,m64,NED,What hath God wrought?
31322,L224998,u986,m64,BRENDA,Whatever you make yourself.
31323,L224997,u991,m64,NED,No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
31324,L224960,u986,m64,BRENDA,"We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?"
31325,L224959,u991,m64,NED,Holy shit...
31326,L224935,u986,m64,BRENDA,Dancer.
31327,L224934,u991,m64,NED,What do you want to be when you grow up?
31328,L224920,u991,m64,NED,"God, but I love that sexy talk."
31329,L224919,u986,m64,BRENDA,"You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry."
31330,L224918,u991,m64,NED,Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
31331,L224917,u986,m64,BRENDA,I don't believe you...
31332,L224916,u991,m64,NED,Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
31333,L225009,u991,m64,NED,"God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires."
31334,L225008,u988,m64,JACK,Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
31335,L224994,u991,m64,NED,"Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen."
31336,L224993,u988,m64,JACK,It's gonna be a long summer.
31337,L224940,u988,m64,JACK,"Coach, athletic director somewhere."
31338,L224939,u991,m64,NED,Jack?
31339,L224863,u988,m64,JACK,Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
31340,L224862,u991,m64,NED,What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
31341,L224858,u991,m64,NED,I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
31342,L224857,u988,m64,JACK,Ow!
31343,L224856,u991,m64,NED,Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
31344,L224855,u988,m64,JACK,Ha!
31345,L225110,u989,m64,MARCIE,Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
31346,L225109,u988,m64,JACK,Whassamatta?
31347,L225108,u989,m64,MARCIE,Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
31348,L225107,u988,m64,JACK,Umhummmmph.
31349,L225106,u989,m64,MARCIE,Best over...
31350,L225105,u988,m64,JACK,Mmmmmmmph.
31351,L225104,u989,m64,MARCIE,Mmmmmmmph?
31352,L225100,u988,m64,JACK,"Just a little. Wait a minute, woman."
31353,L225099,u989,m64,MARCIE,Are you wet?
31354,L225098,u989,m64,MARCIE,Lead the way!
31355,L225097,u988,m64,JACK,This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
31356,L225096,u989,m64,MARCIE,I call it my shower dream.
31357,L225095,u988,m64,JACK,It's just a dream.
31358,L225093,u988,m64,JACK,You? The brick?
31359,L225092,u989,m64,MARCIE,I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
31360,L225091,u988,m64,JACK,Looks like a storm.
31361,L225090,u989,m64,MARCIE,I guess...
31362,L225089,u988,m64,JACK,"I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know."
31363,L225088,u989,m64,MARCIE,Don't call him.
31364,L225087,u988,m64,JACK,Ned!
31365,L225086,u989,m64,MARCIE,He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
31366,L225085,u988,m64,JACK,I don't love Neddy.
31367,L225084,u989,m64,MARCIE,What about Neddy?
31368,L225083,u989,m64,MARCIE,I love you.
31369,L225082,u988,m64,JACK,I love you.
31370,L225081,u989,m64,MARCIE,Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
31371,L225080,u988,m64,JACK,Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
31372,L225079,u989,m64,MARCIE,"Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you."
31373,L225078,u988,m64,JACK,"Just a walk, for Chrissakes."
31374,L224861,u988,m64,JACK,Good call.
31375,L224860,u989,m64,MARCIE,How about our last jay?
31376,L225059,u991,m64,NED,"But it's in the brochure! ""Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program."" You just saw it."
31377,L225058,u989,m64,MARCIE,Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
31378,L225037,u991,m64,NED,Those things can be nasty.
31379,L225036,u989,m64,MARCIE,You okay?
31380,L225031,u991,m64,NED,"Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!"
31381,L225030,u989,m64,MARCIE,Last line of Gone With the Wind?
31382,L224944,u989,m64,MARCIE,Rocky Road.
31383,L224943,u991,m64,NED,"Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?"
31384,L224938,u989,m64,MARCIE,"Okay, Fireman."
31385,L224937,u991,m64,NED,Girls can't be cowboys.
31386,L224936,u989,m64,MARCIE,Cowboy.
31387,L224866,u991,m64,NED,"Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years."
31388,L224865,u989,m64,MARCIE,It's beautiful...
31389,L224854,u991,m64,NED,There you are dead wrong.
31390,L224853,u989,m64,MARCIE,"Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy."
31391,L225132,u993,m64,STEVE,For two lonely nights.
31392,L225131,u992,m64,SANDY,That's thirty percent.
31393,L225130,u993,m64,STEVE,Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
31394,L225128,u992,m64,SANDY,...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
31395,L225127,u993,m64,STEVE,I mean...
31396,L225126,u992,m64,SANDY,One night on the town.
31397,L225125,u993,m64,STEVE,How much do I owe you?
31398,L225124,u992,m64,SANDY,They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
31399,L225123,u993,m64,STEVE,I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
31400,L225122,u992,m64,SANDY,Aw.
31401,L225121,u993,m64,STEVE,I got to.
31402,L225120,u992,m64,SANDY,You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
31403,L225119,u993,m64,STEVE,"No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy."
31404,L225118,u992,m64,SANDY,Anything else you want?
31405,L225184,u993,m64,STEVE,Yeah.
31406,L225183,u994,m64,TIERNEY,Another coincidence.
31407,L225182,u993,m64,STEVE,Good luck.
31408,L225181,u993,m64,STEVE,Sure.
31409,L225180,u994,m64,TIERNEY,"Have to drop you here, Steve."
31410,L225171,u993,m64,STEVE,You've made a science out of coincidence.
31411,L225170,u994,m64,TIERNEY,"Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts."
31412,L225151,u994,m64,TIERNEY,Why not?
31413,L225150,u993,m64,STEVE,I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
31414,L225149,u994,m64,TIERNEY,I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
31415,L227821,u995,m65,BORDER GUARD,Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
31416,L227820,u997,m65,JACOB,"I meant me, my son and my daughter."
31417,L227819,u995,m65,BORDER GUARD,You said it was just you and your son.
31418,L227818,u997,m65,JACOB,"Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom."
31419,L227817,u995,m65,BORDER GUARD,What was that?
31420,L227813,u997,m65,JACOB,Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
31421,L227812,u995,m65,BORDER GUARD,What is your purpose in Mexico?
31422,L227811,u997,m65,JACOB,Just my son and I.
31423,L227810,u995,m65,BORDER GUARD,How many with you?
31424,L228156,u996,m65,CARLOS,Vamanos!
31425,L228155,u1005,m65,SETH,So let's do it.
31426,L228154,u996,m65,CARLOS,"Yeah, follow us."
31427,L228153,u1005,m65,SETH,So do I just follow you?
31428,L228152,u996,m65,CARLOS,It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
31429,L228151,u1005,m65,SETH,"I said new, this is an '90."
31430,L228150,u996,m65,CARLOS,You like the car?
31431,L228148,u1005,m65,SETH,"Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty."
31432,L228147,u996,m65,CARLOS,Twenty-eight.
31433,L228146,u1005,m65,SETH,"You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start."
31434,L228145,u996,m65,CARLOS,"Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?"
31435,L228144,u1005,m65,SETH,"Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are."
31436,L228143,u996,m65,CARLOS,"I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?"
31437,L228142,u1005,m65,SETH,"Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead."
31438,L228141,u996,m65,CARLOS,"No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning."
31439,L228140,u1005,m65,SETH,Have you ever been there before?
31440,L228139,u996,m65,CARLOS,"I don't know, one place's as good as another."
31441,L228138,u1005,m65,SETH,"Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?"
31442,L228137,u996,m65,CARLOS,Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
31443,L228113,u997,m65,JACOB,To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
31444,L228112,u1004,m65,SCOTT,Why did they block the door again?
31445,L228109,u997,m65,JACOB,"Thank you, son."
31446,L228108,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name."
31447,L228107,u997,m65,JACOB,It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
31448,L228106,u1004,m65,SCOTT,You don't believe in suicide.
31449,L227809,u997,m65,JACOB,"I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to ""go for it."" I need your cover. Cover my ass."
31450,L227808,u1004,m65,SCOTT,He's running the show.
31451,L227807,u997,m65,JACOB,"Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions."
31452,L227806,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will."
31453,L227805,u997,m65,JACOB,"Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this."
31454,L227804,u1004,m65,SCOTT,They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
31455,L227803,u997,m65,JACOB,What about Kate?
31456,L227802,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance."
31457,L227801,u997,m65,JACOB,"If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go."
31458,L227800,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us."
31459,L227799,u997,m65,JACOB,Have you forgotten about your sister?
31460,L227781,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there."
31461,L227780,u997,m65,JACOB,I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
31462,L227779,u1004,m65,SCOTT,What are you gonna do?
31463,L227646,u997,m65,JACOB,I have no idea.
31464,L227645,u1004,m65,SCOTT,What's this guy's problem?
31465,L227508,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico."
31466,L227507,u997,m65,JACOB,I'm exhausted.
31467,L227506,u1004,m65,SCOTT,Why do you want to stop?
31468,L227502,u1004,m65,SCOTT,The truth hurts.
31469,L227501,u997,m65,JACOB,"Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?"
31470,L227492,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?"
31471,L227491,u997,m65,JACOB,"We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --"
31472,L228096,u997,m65,JACOB,"Kate, Scott?"
31473,L228095,u1005,m65,SETH,I promise.
31474,L228093,u997,m65,JACOB,Amen.
31475,L228092,u1005,m65,SETH,I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
31476,L228091,u997,m65,JACOB,"Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did."
31477,L228090,u1005,m65,SETH,My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
31478,L228089,u997,m65,JACOB,What's this stuff?
31479,L228085,u997,m65,JACOB,"You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time."
31480,L228084,u1005,m65,SETH,You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
31481,L228082,u997,m65,JACOB,Yep.
31482,L228081,u1005,m65,SETH,Did he...?
31483,L228029,u1005,m65,SETH,"Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?"
31484,L228028,u997,m65,JACOB,"What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness."
31485,L228027,u1005,m65,SETH,"I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix."
31486,L228024,u1005,m65,SETH,"In other words, no."
31487,L228023,u997,m65,JACOB,In the Winnebago.
31488,L228022,u1005,m65,SETH,"Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?"
31489,L228021,u997,m65,JACOB,"I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw."
31490,L228020,u1005,m65,SETH,"You too, preacher?"
31491,L228019,u1005,m65,SETH,"Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about ""I don't believe in vampires"" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires."
31492,L228018,u997,m65,JACOB,"Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?"
31493,L227947,u1005,m65,SETH,Forever together.
31494,L227946,u997,m65,JACOB,"Now, is your shit together?"
31495,L227945,u997,m65,JACOB,To yours.
31496,L227944,u1005,m65,SETH,To your family.
31497,L227942,u997,m65,JACOB,"Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it."
31498,L227941,u1005,m65,SETH,What did you call me?
31499,L227940,u997,m65,JACOB,"Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?"
31500,L227939,u1005,m65,SETH,"I never said do what I do, I said do what I say."
31501,L227938,u997,m65,JACOB,"Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too."
31502,L227937,u1005,m65,SETH,"I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head."
31503,L227936,u997,m65,JACOB,What are you going to do?
31504,L227935,u1005,m65,SETH,"He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', ""Fuck you Jack."" I hear that loud and clear."
31505,L227934,u997,m65,JACOB,He backed down.
31506,L227933,u1005,m65,SETH,"I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too."
31507,L227932,u997,m65,JACOB,Why are you so agitated?
31508,L227924,u1005,m65,SETH,"Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?"
31509,L227923,u997,m65,JACOB,"No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now."
31510,L227922,u1005,m65,SETH,"Why not, against your religion?"
31511,L227921,u997,m65,JACOB,Pass.
31512,L227920,u1005,m65,SETH,Who else?
31513,L227868,u1005,m65,SETH,"Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club."
31514,L227867,u997,m65,JACOB,Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
31515,L227839,u1005,m65,SETH,"Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going."
31516,L227838,u997,m65,JACOB,Then?
31517,L227835,u1005,m65,SETH,"Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right."
31518,L227834,u997,m65,JACOB,"We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go."
31519,L227778,u1005,m65,SETH,"Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple."
31520,L227777,u997,m65,JACOB,I don't have the slightest idea.
31521,L227776,u1005,m65,SETH,"As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?"
31522,L227775,u997,m65,JACOB,"I'm telling you, don't hurt her."
31523,L227760,u1005,m65,SETH,"You best better get it done, Pops."
31524,L227759,u997,m65,JACOB,I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
31525,L227758,u1005,m65,SETH,"Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border."
31526,L227752,u1005,m65,SETH,"Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!"
31527,L227751,u997,m65,JACOB,"If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him."
31528,L227748,u1005,m65,SETH,"I can handle Richie, don't worry."
31529,L227747,u997,m65,JACOB,You won't let him touch her?
31530,L227746,u1005,m65,SETH,"Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning."
31531,L227745,u997,m65,JACOB,"No, I didn't."
31532,L227744,u1005,m65,SETH,"Didn't like it, did ya?"
31533,L227743,u997,m65,JACOB,Yes.
31534,L227742,u1005,m65,SETH,"Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?"
31535,L227741,u997,m65,JACOB,You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
31536,L227740,u1005,m65,SETH,"Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit."
31537,L227739,u997,m65,JACOB,How do I know you'll keep your word?
31538,L227738,u1005,m65,SETH,"I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy."
31539,L227737,u997,m65,JACOB,Yes.
31540,L227736,u1005,m65,SETH,"I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?"
31541,L227735,u997,m65,JACOB,"I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business."
31542,L227734,u1005,m65,SETH,Why'd ya quit?
31543,L227733,u997,m65,JACOB,Yes.
31544,L227732,u1005,m65,SETH,Was? As in not anymore?
31545,L227731,u997,m65,JACOB,I was a minister.
31546,L227730,u1005,m65,SETH,You're a preacher?
31547,L227729,u997,m65,JACOB,Real McCoy.
31548,L227728,u1005,m65,SETH,"I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?"
31549,L227727,u997,m65,JACOB,Yes.
31550,L227726,u1005,m65,SETH,Is this real?
31551,L227725,u997,m65,JACOB,"Yes, they do."
31552,L227724,u1005,m65,SETH,"Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?"
31553,L227723,u997,m65,JACOB,Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
31554,L227722,u1005,m65,SETH,Died instantly?
31555,L227721,u997,m65,JACOB,"No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died."
31556,L227720,u1005,m65,SETH,"Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?"
31557,L227719,u997,m65,JACOB,Auto wreck.
31558,L227718,u1005,m65,SETH,How'd she die?
31559,L227717,u997,m65,JACOB,"Yes, she is."
31560,L227716,u1005,m65,SETH,She's dead?
31561,L227715,u997,m65,JACOB,In heaven.
31562,L227714,u1005,m65,SETH,Where is the little lady?
31563,L227713,u997,m65,JACOB,My wife.
31564,L227712,u1005,m65,SETH,Who's this?
31565,L227710,u997,m65,JACOB,Scott and Kate.
31566,L227709,u1005,m65,SETH,"Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?"
31567,L227700,u1005,m65,SETH,"Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life."
31568,L227699,u997,m65,JACOB,Yes.
31569,L227697,u1005,m65,SETH,That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
31570,L227696,u997,m65,JACOB,"My children are not going with you, and that's that."
31571,L227695,u1005,m65,SETH,"Sorry, I need everybody."
31572,L227694,u997,m65,JACOB,"If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you."
31573,L227693,u1005,m65,SETH,Come again?
31574,L227692,u997,m65,JACOB,Not a chance.
31575,L227678,u1005,m65,SETH,"Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front."
31576,L227677,u997,m65,JACOB,On the dresser.
31577,L227676,u1005,m65,SETH,Where are the keys to the motor home?
31578,L227675,u1005,m65,SETH,"Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!"
31579,L227674,u997,m65,JACOB,"It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right."
31580,L227670,u1005,m65,SETH,"It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance."
31581,L227669,u997,m65,JACOB,"What's this about, money?"
31582,L227668,u1005,m65,SETH,"Oh, well, excuse me all to hell."
31583,L227667,u997,m65,JACOB,Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
31584,L227666,u1005,m65,SETH,How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
31585,L227665,u997,m65,JACOB,He's my son.
31586,L227664,u1005,m65,SETH,What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
31587,L227661,u1005,m65,SETH,"Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face."
31588,L227660,u997,m65,JACOB,Jacob.
31589,L227659,u1005,m65,SETH,What's your name?
31590,L228118,u998,m65,KATE,Everybody goes home!
31591,L228117,u997,m65,JACOB,No!
31592,L228116,u998,m65,KATE,I'm going for 'em!
31593,L228105,u997,m65,JACOB,"Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One..."
31594,L228104,u998,m65,KATE,"I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you."
31595,L228103,u997,m65,JACOB,"Not good enough, swear to God."
31596,L228102,u998,m65,KATE,"Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!"
31597,L228101,u997,m65,JACOB,"Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four..."
31598,L228098,u997,m65,JACOB,Scott?
31599,L228097,u998,m65,KATE,I promise.
31600,L228087,u997,m65,JACOB,"No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead."
31601,L228086,u998,m65,KATE,"You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?"
31602,L228039,u998,m65,KATE,So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
31603,L228038,u997,m65,JACOB,About two hours from now.
31604,L227642,u998,m65,KATE,"Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service..."
31605,L227641,u997,m65,JACOB,It has a bed. That's all I care about.
31606,L227640,u998,m65,KATE,"If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place."
31607,L227639,u997,m65,JACOB,It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
31608,L227638,u998,m65,KATE,It's a flop house.
31609,L227637,u997,m65,JACOB,There's nothing wrong with this place.
31610,L227521,u997,m65,JACOB,"Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead."
31611,L227520,u998,m65,KATE,What do you think Mom would say?
31612,L227519,u997,m65,JACOB,"Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore."
31613,L227518,u998,m65,KATE,"That happens, you'll get it back."
31614,L227517,u997,m65,JACOB,I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
31615,L227516,u998,m65,KATE,"It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?"
31616,L227515,u997,m65,JACOB,"Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?"
31617,L227514,u998,m65,KATE,I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
31618,L227513,u997,m65,JACOB,"That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting."
31619,L227512,u998,m65,KATE,"Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --"
31620,L227510,u998,m65,KATE,"Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim."
31621,L227509,u997,m65,JACOB,"I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed."
31622,L227505,u998,m65,KATE,Ain't it the truth.
31623,L227504,u997,m65,JACOB,"You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me."
31624,L227503,u998,m65,KATE,It's the bitterest of pills.
31625,L227768,u1003,m65,RICHARD,You asked me if I would --
31626,L227767,u998,m65,KATE,What did I say?
31627,L227766,u1003,m65,RICHARD,What you said to me in the room.
31628,L227765,u998,m65,KATE,Do what?
31629,L227764,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will."
31630,L227763,u998,m65,KATE,What?
31631,L227708,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Mexicans.
31632,L227707,u998,m65,KATE,What's in Mexico?
31633,L227706,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Mexico.
31634,L227705,u998,m65,KATE,Where are you taking us?
31635,L227704,u1003,m65,RICHARD,What?
31636,L227680,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Sure.
31637,L227679,u998,m65,KATE,"Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?"
31638,L227673,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won."
31639,L227672,u998,m65,KATE,What's going on?
31640,L228160,u998,m65,KATE,Later.
31641,L228159,u1005,m65,SETH,See ya.
31642,L228158,u998,m65,KATE,Me too.
31643,L228157,u1005,m65,SETH,I'm sorry.
31644,L228131,u1005,m65,SETH,You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
31645,L228130,u998,m65,KATE,Should I use the last bullets on us?
31646,L228129,u1005,m65,SETH,"Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper."
31647,L228128,u998,m65,KATE,Not many.
31648,L228127,u1005,m65,SETH,"How many bullets left, kid?"
31649,L228121,u1005,m65,SETH,Anytime.
31650,L228120,u998,m65,KATE,Watch my back!
31651,L228076,u998,m65,KATE,Noooo!
31652,L228075,u1005,m65,SETH,Daddy's dead.
31653,L228074,u998,m65,KATE,We have to go back for Daddy!
31654,L228000,u1005,m65,SETH,Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
31655,L227999,u998,m65,KATE,I'm really sorry.
31656,L227998,u1005,m65,SETH,"Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory."
31657,L227997,u998,m65,KATE,Are you okay?
31658,L227930,u998,m65,KATE,Okay.
31659,L227929,u1005,m65,SETH,"How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?"
31660,L227837,u1005,m65,SETH,"In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, ""Digayo."" When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called ""The Titty Twister."" From what I hear, you can't miss it."
31661,L227836,u998,m65,KATE,You're gonna let us go?
31662,L227756,u1005,m65,SETH,"Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?"
31663,L227755,u998,m65,KATE,"Yeah, we got a bible."
31664,L227754,u1005,m65,SETH,"You must have a bible in here, don't cha?"
31665,L227753,u998,m65,KATE,Yeah.
31666,L227688,u1005,m65,SETH,You damn well better. Go.
31667,L227687,u998,m65,KATE,Yes.
31668,L227686,u1005,m65,SETH,Do you believe me?
31669,L227685,u998,m65,KATE,Yes.
31670,L227684,u1005,m65,SETH,"You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?"
31671,L227649,u1005,m65,SETH,"The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9."
31672,L227648,u998,m65,KATE,Creepy guy.
31673,L227500,u998,m65,KATE,"Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff."
31674,L227499,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"-- see this, television!"
31675,L227498,u998,m65,KATE,-- you got your shower --
31676,L227497,u1004,m65,SCOTT,-- you got your sink --
31677,L227496,u998,m65,KATE,-- you got your microwave --
31678,L227495,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --"
31679,L227596,u1006,m65,STANLEY CHASE,I would say that's a very safe assumption.
31680,L227595,u999,m65,KELLY HOUGE,"Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?"
31681,L227594,u1006,m65,STANLEY CHASE,"This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk."
31682,L227593,u999,m65,KELLY HOUGE,What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
31683,L227592,u1006,m65,STANLEY CHASE,We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
31684,L227591,u999,m65,KELLY HOUGE,"Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?"
31685,L227590,u1006,m65,STANLEY CHASE,"Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice."
31686,L227589,u999,m65,KELLY HOUGE,"Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico."
31687,L227588,u1006,m65,STANLEY CHASE,"For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko."
31688,L227466,u1001,m65,PETE,Six-fifty.
31689,L227465,u1000,m65,MCGRAW,"Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?"
31690,L227449,u1001,m65,PETE,Knock yourself out.
31691,L227448,u1000,m65,MCGRAW,"They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode."
31692,L227447,u1000,m65,MCGRAW,"Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage."
31693,L227446,u1001,m65,PETE,That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
31694,L227445,u1000,m65,MCGRAW,"What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?"
31695,L227444,u1001,m65,PETE,"You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place."
31696,L227443,u1000,m65,MCGRAW,"Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?"
31697,L227442,u1001,m65,PETE,Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
31698,L227441,u1000,m65,MCGRAW,"Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty."
31699,L227440,u1001,m65,PETE,Whatsamatter?
31700,L227439,u1000,m65,MCGRAW,"Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight."
31701,L227438,u1001,m65,PETE,"I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave."
31702,L227437,u1000,m65,MCGRAW,Not even for lunch?
31703,L227436,u1001,m65,PETE,Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
31704,L227435,u1000,m65,MCGRAW,Hot goddamn day!
31705,L227480,u1005,m65,SETH,"Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!"
31706,L227479,u1001,m65,PETE,I never said help us!
31707,L227459,u1005,m65,SETH,You callin' him a liar?
31708,L227458,u1001,m65,PETE,I wasn't scratching!
31709,L227457,u1005,m65,SETH,He says you were scratching.
31710,L227456,u1001,m65,PETE,What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
31711,L227455,u1005,m65,SETH,Were you giving that pig signals?
31712,L227454,u1005,m65,SETH,"I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to ""Benny's World of Blood."""
31713,L227453,u1001,m65,PETE,"He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up."
31714,L227452,u1005,m65,SETH,Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
31715,L227451,u1001,m65,PETE,What do you want from me? I did what you said.
31716,L227917,u1005,m65,SETH,"I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order."
31717,L227916,u1002,m65,RAZOR CHARLIE,Best in Mexico.
31718,L227900,u1002,m65,RAZOR CHARLIE,"This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!"
31719,L227899,u1005,m65,SETH,Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
31720,L227898,u1002,m65,RAZOR CHARLIE,This is a private club. You're not welcome.

31726,L227957,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?"

31729,L227954,u1005,m65,SETH,Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
31730,L227886,u1005,m65,SETH,"Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together."
31731,L227885,u1003,m65,RICHARD,It don't look together.
31732,L227884,u1005,m65,SETH,My shit is together.
31733,L227883,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother."
31734,L227882,u1005,m65,SETH,I'm here with you.
31735,L227881,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Where are you?
31736,L227880,u1005,m65,SETH,What do you mean?
31737,L227879,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Where are you right now?

31739,L227877,u1003,m65,RICHARD,You're lookin' green.
31740,L227876,u1005,m65,SETH,"No, Richie, what do I look like?"
31741,L227875,u1003,m65,RICHARD,You know what you look like?
31742,L227874,u1005,m65,SETH,That's what you look like.
31743,L227873,u1003,m65,RICHARD,I'm lookin' scared?
31744,L227872,u1005,m65,SETH,"That's how you're lookin', Richie."
31745,L227871,u1003,m65,RICHARD,That's what you think?
31746,L227861,u1005,m65,SETH,"It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit."
31747,L227860,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription."
31748,L227859,u1005,m65,SETH,"When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it."
31749,L227858,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see."
31750,L227857,u1005,m65,SETH,"Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses."
31751,L227856,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!"
31752,L227855,u1005,m65,SETH,They broke when you fell.
31753,L227854,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Far out.  Where are my glasses?
31754,L227853,u1005,m65,SETH,"Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?"
31755,L227852,u1003,m65,RICHARD,We are?
31756,L227851,u1005,m65,SETH,"We are...  ""South of the border down Mexico way."""
31757,L227850,u1003,m65,RICHARD,What?
31758,L227849,u1005,m65,SETH,"Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans."
31759,L227848,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up."
31760,L227847,u1005,m65,SETH,"Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?"
31761,L227846,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Really?
31762,L227845,u1005,m65,SETH,"Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes."
31763,L227844,u1003,m65,RICHARD,I did?
31764,L227843,u1005,m65,SETH,"I don't know, you just passed out."
31765,L227842,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Yeah, I think so. What happened?"
31766,L227841,u1005,m65,SETH,You okay?
31767,L227816,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now."
31768,L227815,u1005,m65,SETH,This ain't the time.
31769,L227814,u1003,m65,RICHARD,I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
31770,L227798,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Or what?
31771,L227797,u1005,m65,SETH,Keep your voice down.
31772,L227796,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks."
31773,L227795,u1005,m65,SETH,"This ain't the time, Richard."
31774,L227794,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"You meant that, but you meant the other, too."
31775,L227793,u1005,m65,SETH,"Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool."
31776,L227792,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut."
31777,L227791,u1005,m65,SETH,"No, I didn't."
31778,L227790,u1003,m65,RICHARD,You just called me a fuckin' nut.
31779,L227789,u1005,m65,SETH,What?
31780,L227788,u1003,m65,RICHARD,What does that mean?
31781,L227787,u1005,m65,SETH,"As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine."
31782,L227786,u1003,m65,RICHARD,They're gonna search the van.
31783,L227785,u1005,m65,SETH,"Duly noted. Now, shut up."
31784,L227784,u1003,m65,RICHARD,I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
31785,L227783,u1005,m65,SETH,"Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,"
31786,L227782,u1003,m65,RICHARD,This isn't gonna work.
31787,L227770,u1003,m65,RICHARD,What?
31788,L227769,u1005,m65,SETH,Richard!
31789,L227633,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Yes, Seth, I understand."
31790,L227632,u1005,m65,SETH,"Yes, Seth, I understand."
31791,L227631,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Yes.
31792,L227630,u1005,m65,SETH,"Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes."
31793,L227629,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Seth, if you were me --"
31794,L227628,u1005,m65,SETH,"This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?"
31795,L227627,u1003,m65,RICHARD,What?
31796,L227626,u1005,m65,SETH,Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
31797,L227625,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"It's not your fault, it's her fault!"
31798,L227624,u1005,m65,SETH,Is it me? Is it my fault?
31799,L227623,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person."
31800,L227622,u1005,m65,SETH,No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
31801,L227621,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do."
31802,L227620,u1005,m65,SETH,"Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?"
31803,L227616,u1005,m65,SETH,What the fuck is she doin' there?!
31804,L227615,u1003,m65,RICHARD,She's in the other room.
31805,L227614,u1005,m65,SETH,"What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?"
31806,L227613,u1003,m65,RICHARD,What?
31807,L227612,u1005,m65,SETH,Where's the woman?
31808,L227611,u1005,m65,SETH,"I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --"
31809,L227610,u1003,m65,RICHARD,How do you know?
31810,L227609,u1005,m65,SETH,"Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us."
31811,L227608,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down."
31812,L227607,u1005,m65,SETH,I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
31813,L227606,u1003,m65,RICHARD,They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
31814,L227605,u1005,m65,SETH,"Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?"
31815,L227604,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Didya look at the border?
31816,L227603,u1005,m65,SETH,Cops.
31817,L227602,u1003,m65,RICHARD,What'd ya see?
31818,L227601,u1005,m65,SETH,Sight seein'.
31819,L227600,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?"
31820,L227550,u1005,m65,SETH,-- This conversation is over.
31821,L227549,u1003,m65,RICHARD,All I'm saying --
31822,L227548,u1005,m65,SETH,"These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word ""barter"".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent."
31823,L227547,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Did you even to try to negotiate?
31824,L227546,u1005,m65,SETH,"That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us."
31825,L227545,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent."
31826,L227541,u1005,m65,SETH,I'm gonna go get the money.
31827,L227540,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Feels good.
31828,L227539,u1005,m65,SETH,"I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?"
31829,L227538,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch."
31830,L227537,u1005,m65,SETH,How's it feel?
31831,L227530,u1005,m65,SETH,"They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need."
31832,L227529,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Do they have a waterbed?
31833,L227528,u1005,m65,SETH,No.
31834,L227527,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Do they have an X-rated channel?
31835,L227526,u1005,m65,SETH,No.
31836,L227525,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Do they have cable?
31837,L227487,u1005,m65,SETH,He didn't recognize shit.
31838,L227486,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us."
31839,L227485,u1005,m65,SETH,What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
31840,L227484,u1005,m65,SETH,One... Two... Three.
31841,L227483,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Gotcha!
31842,L227482,u1005,m65,SETH,"When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!"
31843,L227481,u1003,m65,RICHARD,Yeah?
31844,L227478,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, ""Help us!"""
31845,L227477,u1005,m65,SETH,Richie? You okay?
31846,L227476,u1005,m65,SETH,Shut up and start the car.
31847,L227475,u1003,m65,RICHARD,You believe me don't cha?
31848,L227474,u1005,m65,SETH,Start the car.
31849,L227473,u1003,m65,RICHARD,"Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:"
31850,L227472,u1005,m65,SETH,What the fuck is wrong with you --
31851,L227468,u1003,m65,RICHARD,He signaled the Ranger.
31852,L227467,u1005,m65,SETH,What the fuck was that about?
31853,L228079,u1004,m65,SCOTT,He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
31854,L228078,u1005,m65,SETH,He needs our help!
31855,L228077,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them."
31856,L228050,u1005,m65,SETH,"Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher."
31857,L228049,u1004,m65,SCOTT,You could take their head off.
31858,L227950,u1005,m65,SETH,Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
31859,L227949,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"Yeah, it's mine."
31860,L227948,u1005,m65,SETH,In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
31861,L227926,u1004,m65,SCOTT,"Okay, I'll have one."
31862,L227925,u1005,m65,SETH,"How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?"
31863,L242251,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"What'd you find, Kathy?"
31864,L242250,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,Wow...
31865,L242249,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,"Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to ""See Addendum.""  Checking..."
31866,L242248,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Who signed as his ""sponsoring officer""?"
31867,L242247,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,Got it.
31868,L242246,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"""Wickwire, Thomas Dane.""  See what you can find."
31869,L242245,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,"Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me."
31870,L242244,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
31871,L242243,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,Who's...  Lieuten --
31872,L242242,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Don't say my name.
31873,L242241,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,"Administration, Ensign Blondell."
31874,L241984,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,"More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising."
31875,L241983,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"But are there... I mean, how many..."
31876,L241982,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,"Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know."
31877,L241981,u1017,m66,JORDAN,The woman I saw you with...
31878,L241980,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,I've been accused of that wish.
31879,L241979,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, ""Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!""  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  ""Gee, I wish I were a man."""
31880,L241978,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,Just some of the women.
31881,L241977,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Who's ""we""?"
31882,L241976,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,"Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious."
31883,L241975,u1017,m66,JORDAN,That's what I hear.
31884,L241974,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
31885,L241669,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,"No problem, lieutenant."
31886,L241668,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Thank you, ensign."
31887,L241667,u1007,m66,BLONDELL,"B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door."
31888,L241889,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now..."
31889,L241888,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Of course, but there's more --"
31890,L241887,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"""Security""?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?"
31891,L241886,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator."
31892,L241881,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?"
31893,L241880,u1008,m66,C.O.,Standing right here in my office.
31894,L241879,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?"
31895,L241878,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Your prerogative, Senator."
31896,L241877,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  ""Midnight Mahogany""? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here."
31897,L241874,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts."
31898,L241873,u1008,m66,C.O.,-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
31899,L241872,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this ""G.I. Jane"" thing."
31900,L241871,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --"
31901,L241870,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --"
31902,L242310,u1008,m66,C.O.,Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
31903,L242309,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Sir?  What did he say?
31904,L242308,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'."
31905,L242207,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
31906,L242206,u1008,m66,C.O.,I'm not sure what --
31907,L242205,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
31908,L242204,u1008,m66,C.O.,"I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed."
31909,L242203,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud..."
31910,L242202,u1008,m66,C.O.,"I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself."
31911,L242201,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I'm saying, we're just friends."
31912,L242188,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong."
31913,L242187,u1008,m66,C.O.,"I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  ""... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."""
31914,L241894,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Permission to evaporate, O'Neil."
31915,L241893,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Permission to leave, sir?"
31916,L241891,u1008,m66,C.O.,"""We'll all have lunch.""  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!"
31917,L241890,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --"
31918,L241876,u1008,m66,C.O.,"You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?"
31919,L241875,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"See me, sir?"
31920,L241800,u1008,m66,C.O.,"You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get."
31921,L241799,u1017,m66,JORDAN,So I'll get a fair shot?
31922,L241798,u1008,m66,C.O.,Then good night.
31923,L241797,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Wouldn't dream of it, sir."
31924,L241796,u1008,m66,C.O.,"And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular."
31925,L241795,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Across the board, sir."
31926,L241794,u1008,m66,C.O.,Straight up?
31927,L241793,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Same rules for everyone, sir."
31928,L241792,u1008,m66,C.O.,Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
31929,L241791,u1017,m66,JORDAN,The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
31930,L241790,u1008,m66,C.O.,"No, sir, WHAT?"
31931,L241789,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"No, sir."
31932,L241788,u1008,m66,C.O.,"What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?"
31933,L241787,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I think you've resented me from the start, sir."
31934,L241786,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home."
31935,L241785,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Pardon?
31936,L241784,u1008,m66,C.O.,Did you just have a brain-fart?
31937,L241783,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- ""Yeah, she made it, but...""  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?"
31938,L241782,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Because I was civil, now you're complaining."
31939,L241781,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met."
31940,L241780,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Oh, really."
31941,L241779,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here."
31942,L241778,u1008,m66,C.O.,"All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?"
31943,L241777,u1008,m66,C.O.,Didn't take long.
31944,L241776,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way."
31945,L241685,u1008,m66,C.O.,"If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave."
31946,L241684,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect."
31947,L241683,u1008,m66,C.O.,Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
31948,L241682,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"None at this time, sir."
31949,L241681,u1008,m66,C.O.,"I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?"
31950,L241680,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Really, I have no problem with --"
31951,L241679,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask."
31952,L241678,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --"
31953,L241677,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain."
31954,L241676,u1008,m66,C.O.,"So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you."
31955,L241675,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I'm fine, sir."
31956,L241674,u1008,m66,C.O.,Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
31957,L241673,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Thank you, sir."
31958,L241672,u1008,m66,C.O.,"Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant..."
31959,L242017,u1017,m66,JORDAN,West?
31960,L242016,u1009,m66,CORTEZ,Entering my scan now...
31961,L242015,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Newberry, get a photo.  South?"
31962,L241905,u1009,m66,CORTEZ,"No problem, sir!"
31963,L241904,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Fine by me, sir!"
31964,L241901,u1009,m66,CORTEZ,Motherachrist...
31965,L241900,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Ah, c'mon..."
31966,L241757,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Sir...
31967,L241756,u1009,m66,CORTEZ,"Aw, what is this..."
31968,L242370,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,"O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?"
31969,L242369,u1009,m66,CORTEZ,"What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?"
31970,L242042,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,Fuck me.
31971,L242041,u1009,m66,CORTEZ,"Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!"
31972,L242035,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,"Hey.  Ain't your call, man."
31973,L242034,u1009,m66,CORTEZ,Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
31974,L242033,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,I ain't gonna shoot her.
31975,L242032,u1009,m66,CORTEZ,Smoke her.
31976,L242031,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,Shit.  Think we're had.
31977,L242160,u1011,m66,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,"Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws."
31978,L242159,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
31979,L242158,u1011,m66,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,Did you hear?
31980,L242157,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,Yes?
31981,L241896,u1011,m66,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
31982,L241895,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,Think I overplayed it?
31983,L241578,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,I'll act surprised.
31984,L241577,u1011,m66,DEHAVEN'S AIDE,White House boys want a private meeting.
31985,L241573,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well."
31986,L241572,u1014,m66,HAYES,The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
31987,L241571,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes."
31988,L241570,u1014,m66,HAYES,I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
31989,L241569,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was ""pilot error,"" hmm?"
31990,L241568,u1014,m66,HAYES,I was one member of the investigating commission.
31991,L241567,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?"
31992,L241566,u1014,m66,HAYES,Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
31993,L241565,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"""The Lark Report."""
31994,L241564,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point..."
31995,L241563,u1014,m66,HAYES,"Hardly the case, Senator."
31996,L241561,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  ""Land-based maritime specialties."" Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that..."
31997,L241560,u1014,m66,HAYES,"... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --"
31998,L242303,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime."
31999,L242302,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him."
32000,L242301,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,You'll think about my offer?
32001,L242300,u1017,m66,JORDAN,I'm sure it is.
32002,L242299,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
32003,L242298,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?"
32004,L242297,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team."
32005,L242294,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been."
32006,L242293,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
32007,L242292,u1017,m66,JORDAN,So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
32008,L242291,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
32009,L242290,u1017,m66,JORDAN,You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
32010,L242289,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags."
32011,L242288,u1017,m66,JORDAN,What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
32012,L242287,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same."
32013,L242286,u1017,m66,JORDAN,You don't know that.
32014,L242285,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
32015,L242284,u1017,m66,JORDAN,So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
32016,L242281,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras."
32017,L242280,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,Should probably ask him that.
32018,L242279,u1017,m66,JORDAN,What changed?
32019,L242278,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent."
32020,L242277,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,Absolutely not.
32021,L242276,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
32022,L242275,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --"
32023,L242274,u1017,m66,JORDAN,It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
32024,L242273,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,Sounds familiar.
32025,L242272,u1017,m66,JORDAN,You know him.
32026,L242271,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
32027,L242270,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
32028,L241885,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base."
32029,L241884,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Uh, ma'am."
32030,L241883,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
32031,L241882,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Can't complain, ma'am."
32032,L241636,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now..."
32033,L241635,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
32034,L241634,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"Yes, dear."
32035,L241633,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Uh, question, ma'am."
32036,L241632,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
32037,L241631,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
32038,L241630,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?"
32039,L241629,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?"
32040,L241628,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,California.
32041,L241627,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"""Coronado."""
32042,L241625,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,"High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote."
32043,L241624,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?"
32044,L241623,u1010,m66,DEHAVEN,So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
32045,L242167,u1014,m66,HAYES,"""G.I. Jane.""  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?"
32046,L242166,u1012,m66,FLAG OFFICER #1,"I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly."
32047,L242165,u1014,m66,HAYES,What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
32048,L241593,u1012,m66,FLAG OFFICER #1,Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
32049,L241592,u1014,m66,HAYES,Then I suggest we start there.
32050,L241591,u1012,m66,FLAG OFFICER #1,I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
32051,L241590,u1014,m66,HAYES,"So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?"
32052,L242360,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over."
32053,L242359,u1013,m66,FLEA,"Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!"
32054,L242337,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!"
32055,L242336,u1013,m66,FLEA,"Close as I can get, el-tee!"
32056,L242051,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix..."
32057,L242050,u1013,m66,FLEA,"Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things."
32058,L241832,u1013,m66,FLEA,'Snot me.  It's him.
32059,L241831,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Hey.  You okay, Flea?"
32060,L241828,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Do that.
32061,L241827,u1013,m66,FLEA,"I'll work on it, ma'am."
32062,L241826,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?"
32063,L241825,u1013,m66,FLEA,"No, ma'am."
32064,L241824,u1017,m66,JORDAN,So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
32065,L241823,u1013,m66,FLEA,"It's really ""F. Lee Montgomery"" -- but that gets whittled down to just ""Flea.""  For short, ma'am."
32066,L241822,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Montgomery, why do they call you ""Flea""?"
32067,L242184,u1015,m66,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
32068,L242183,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Sir?
32069,L242182,u1015,m66,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,O'Neil?
32070,L241821,u1015,m66,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
32071,L241820,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Come on, Montgomery..."
32072,L241819,u1015,m66,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,"If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!"
32073,L241818,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Just do it, okay?"
32074,L241760,u1015,m66,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,... two... one... MARK!
32075,L241759,u1017,m66,JORDAN,I can make this wall without --
32076,L241758,u1015,m66,INSTRUCTOR JOHNS,"Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three..."
32077,L242156,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
32078,L242155,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,I oughtta report you.
32079,L242154,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours."
32080,L242153,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,"She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback."
32081,L242152,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
32082,L242151,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,"She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?"
32083,L242150,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
32084,L242149,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
32085,L242148,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
32086,L241898,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,Get it up!
32087,L241897,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death."
32088,L241858,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different."
32089,L241857,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
32090,L241830,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast."
32091,L241829,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,Time.
32092,L242394,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
32093,L242393,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Just a coincidence?
32094,L242392,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
32095,L242391,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I was looking for him earlier, but..."
32096,L242390,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
32097,L242389,u1017,m66,JORDAN,The Navy Cross...
32098,L241771,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"What ""all females""?  If I'm the only --"
32099,L241770,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,"Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called ""gender-norming,"" O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?"
32100,L241724,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,"You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation."
32101,L241723,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I'll try anyway, sir."
32102,L241722,u1016,m66,INSTRUCTOR PYRO,"Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil."
32103,L241721,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine."
32104,L242401,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"""Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."""
32105,L242400,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Which is guy-speak for...
32106,L242399,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined."
32107,L242398,u1017,m66,JORDAN,So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
32108,L242240,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Yeah.  Me too.
32109,L242239,u1019,m66,ROYCE,I'd sure like to know who.
32110,L242238,u1017,m66,JORDAN,You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
32111,L242237,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"""Wickwire, Thomas Dane""... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the ""Appropriation Liaison Office,"" whatever that is."
32112,L242236,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
32113,L242235,u1019,m66,ROYCE,What?
32114,L242234,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"""In Washington..."""
32115,L242232,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game."
32116,L242231,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I don't know, I don't care."
32117,L242230,u1019,m66,ROYCE,Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
32118,L242229,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
32119,L242228,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
32120,L242227,u1017,m66,JORDAN,What about him.
32121,L242226,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"""John James Urgayle.""  The Chief."
32122,L242225,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork."
32123,L242224,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?"
32124,L242223,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?"
32125,L242222,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"It's done with, Royce.  Let it go."
32126,L242221,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me."
32127,L242218,u1019,m66,ROYCE,The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
32128,L242217,u1017,m66,JORDAN,No shortage of suspects.
32129,L242216,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?"
32130,L242215,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
32131,L242214,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"And this class officer... ""Wickwire.""  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for..."
32132,L242213,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay."
32133,L242005,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
32134,L242004,u1019,m66,ROYCE,Jordan.  You watch your ass.
32135,L242003,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce."
32136,L242002,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't..."
32137,L242001,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?"
32138,L242000,u1019,m66,ROYCE,I'm only trying to warn you in case --
32139,L241999,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too."
32140,L241998,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you."
32141,L241997,u1017,m66,JORDAN,So why are you telling me this?
32142,L241996,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about ""G.I. Jane.""  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster."
32143,L241995,u1017,m66,JORDAN,I saw an article...
32144,L241994,u1019,m66,ROYCE,Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
32145,L241993,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Me?  Why me?
32146,L241992,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn."
32147,L241991,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?"
32148,L241990,u1019,m66,ROYCE,That bad?
32149,L241989,u1019,m66,ROYCE,How hard they making it on you?
32150,L241988,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life."
32151,L241987,u1019,m66,ROYCE,I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
32152,L241660,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much."
32153,L241659,u1019,m66,ROYCE,Jordan...
32154,L241658,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know."
32155,L241657,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you."
32156,L241656,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Which is guy-speak for...
32157,L241655,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen."
32158,L241654,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?"
32159,L241653,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --"
32160,L241652,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
32161,L241651,u1019,m66,ROYCE,You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
32162,L241650,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
32163,L241649,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Well, guess I don't even need to be here..."
32164,L241648,u1017,m66,JORDAN,This has nothing to do with you.
32165,L241647,u1019,m66,ROYCE,So dump on me.
32166,L241646,u1017,m66,JORDAN,You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
32167,L241645,u1019,m66,ROYCE,She's haze grey and underway...
32168,L241644,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?"
32169,L241643,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel."
32170,L241642,u1017,m66,JORDAN,I take it you don't either.  Feet.
32171,L241641,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan."
32172,L241640,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Just like you would be.
32173,L241639,u1019,m66,ROYCE,So why're you even considering it? Are you?
32174,L241619,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Is this my glory, sir?"
32175,L241618,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?"
32176,L241617,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle."
32177,L241616,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
32178,L241615,u1019,m66,ROYCE,Probably hear back from CNN first.
32179,L241614,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?"
32180,L241613,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"That was good headwork, lieutenant."
32181,L241610,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?"
32182,L241609,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?"
32183,L241608,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters."
32184,L241607,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Blank faces here, O'Neil."
32185,L241606,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Unless you Whiskey Run.
32186,L241605,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out."
32187,L241604,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?"
32188,L241603,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze."
32189,L241602,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Chances of recovery?
32190,L241601,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries."
32191,L241600,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
32192,L241596,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?"
32193,L241595,u1019,m66,ROYCE,Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
32194,L241594,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Lieutenant O'Neil.
32195,L242191,u1017,m66,JORDAN,This is insane.  You've got no proof.
32196,L242190,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,"I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations."
32197,L242180,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
32198,L242179,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special."
32199,L242178,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,"Sure, sure."
32200,L242177,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Do you, uh, know..."
32201,L242175,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides..."
32202,L242174,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,I think you look beautiful.
32203,L242173,u1017,m66,JORDAN,I can't go out.  Not like this.
32204,L242172,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,"Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?"
32205,L242171,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire."
32206,L242170,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
32207,L242169,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Sorry, didn't mean to --"
32208,L242078,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me..."
32209,L242077,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,Last time I didn't.
32210,L242076,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?"
32211,L242075,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,O'Neil?
32212,L242074,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,Not me.  You?
32213,L242073,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"You got anybody, Wick?"
32214,L242072,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,At first.
32215,L242071,u1017,m66,JORDAN,He was married?
32216,L242070,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
32217,L242069,u1017,m66,JORDAN,That's a good story.
32218,L242068,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,"Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted."
32219,L242067,u1017,m66,JORDAN,They had to kill 'em?
32220,L242066,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,"One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts."
32221,L242065,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"If you got a good one, Wick..."
32222,L242064,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,"When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell..."
32223,L242063,u1017,m66,JORDAN,You really came back for more?  Of this?
32224,L242062,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,"Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit."
32225,L242061,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Wick.  They got your crew, too?"
32226,L242060,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,"You know, I had an apartment about this size once."
32227,L242059,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Who is it?
32228,L241856,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Thanks, Wick."
32229,L241855,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,Hey.  Way to gut it out.
32230,L241751,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,You're kind of a surprise yourself.
32231,L241750,u1017,m66,JORDAN,I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
32232,L241749,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,Made it to Week 10 last time.
32233,L241748,u1017,m66,JORDAN,And how do you know that?
32234,L241747,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,"It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half."
32235,L241746,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Whose orders were those?
32236,L241745,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,"It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway."
32237,L241744,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Well, now I feel so much better."
32238,L241743,u1023,m66,WICKWIRE,They're more afraid of you.
32239,L242368,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead."
32240,L242367,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,Maybe half.  Not even.
32241,L242366,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?"
32242,L242055,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,Smoke it!
32243,L242054,u1017,m66,JORDAN,'Cool?
32244,L242053,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!"
32245,L242052,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,"32 feet, six inches!"
32246,L242039,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,Mighta been civilian.
32247,L242038,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?"
32248,L242029,u1017,m66,JORDAN,I don't know...
32249,L242028,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,She part of the training?
32250,L241848,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --"
32251,L241847,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,Just askin'
32252,L241846,u1017,m66,JORDAN,What're you guys doing?  Huh?
32253,L242378,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating."
32254,L242377,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,O'Neil...
32255,L242358,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Show us where you are, Chief."
32256,L242357,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,Got it.
32257,L242352,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"15, sir."
32258,L242351,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,Say again?  How many micks?
32259,L242350,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over."
32260,L242349,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over."
32261,L242319,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me."
32262,L242318,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Good to see you again, too, sir."
32263,L242317,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three."
32264,L242134,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect."
32265,L242133,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Sure.  Just like your men do.
32266,L242132,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
32267,L242131,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,I'm so glad we agree.
32268,L242130,u1017,m66,JORDAN,No.
32269,L242129,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,Do you?
32270,L242128,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?"
32271,L242127,u1017,m66,JORDAN,We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
32272,L242126,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --"
32273,L242125,u1017,m66,JORDAN,I think you're the liar.
32274,L242124,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
32275,L242123,u1017,m66,JORDAN,That's not right.
32276,L242122,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --"
32277,L242121,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --"
32278,L242120,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,Would you have shot if it was a man?
32279,L242119,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
32280,L242118,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Wasn't deemed a threat.
32281,L242117,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?"
32282,L242116,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?"
32283,L242115,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Should I be afraid?
32284,L242114,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now."
32285,L242113,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
32286,L242112,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
32287,L242111,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Dick, Jane, and Spot."
32288,L242110,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,Any brothers?  Sisters?
32289,L242109,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"""Dad."""
32290,L242108,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?"
32291,L241968,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders."
32292,L241967,u1017,m66,JORDAN,McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
32293,L241966,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant."
32294,L241965,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead."
32295,L241964,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
32296,L241963,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?"
32297,L241962,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft."
32298,L241961,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
32299,L241960,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?"
32300,L241959,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore."
32301,L241958,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Permission to get dressed, sir?"
32302,L241769,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,"Educate her, Pyro."
32303,L241768,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Chief, sir, I don't understand why --"
32304,L241766,u1021,m66,THE CHIEF,You heard me.  Move on.
32305,L241765,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Say again, sir?"
32306,L242343,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Shut your hole, Slutnik."
32307,L242342,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
32308,L242333,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?"
32309,L242332,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,You don't suppose this is just part of...
32310,L242327,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing."
32311,L242326,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,I just wonder how that happened.
32312,L242046,u1017,m66,JORDAN,MOVE!
32313,L242045,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
32314,L242044,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?"
32315,L242019,u1017,m66,JORDAN,North?
32316,L242018,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,Clear.
32317,L241810,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file."
32318,L241809,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
32319,L241808,u1017,m66,JORDAN,That your desk?  I'll take this one.
32320,L241807,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,"Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there."
32321,L241806,u1017,m66,JORDAN,"Funny, the C.O. says I can."
32322,L241805,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,"Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me."
32323,L241804,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Anybody usin' these drawers here?
32324,L241803,u1017,m66,JORDAN,Your new roommate.
32325,L241802,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,"Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?"
32326,L242049,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,This ain't even workin' wrong!
32327,L242048,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,"What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?"
32328,L242047,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,This ain't workin' right!
32329,L242023,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,So am I.
32330,L242022,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
32331,L241774,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
32332,L241773,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,"Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?"
32333,L241695,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,We are so fucked.
32334,L241694,u1020,m66,SLUTNIK,Darth Vader reads poetry...
32335,L241693,u1018,m66,MCCOOL,We're fucked.
32336,L242106,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,"This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes everything very controllable."
32337,L242105,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"I don't...  What, someone on base?  A ""mole""?"
32338,L242104,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,"Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there."
32339,L242103,u1019,m66,ROYCE,Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
32340,L242102,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,I take it this file is still open.
32341,L242101,u1019,m66,ROYCE,"Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but..."
32342,L242100,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
32343,L242099,u1019,m66,ROYCE,I don't know.  Seems...
32344,L242098,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,"If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?"
32345,L242097,u1019,m66,ROYCE,Women.
32346,L242096,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,"Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  ""G.I. Jane"" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all."
32347,L242095,u1019,m66,ROYCE,The first female President?
32348,L242094,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,"The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man."
32349,L242093,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
32350,L242092,u1019,m66,ROYCE,Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
32351,L242091,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
32352,L242090,u1019,m66,ROYCE,The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
32353,L242089,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,"Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights."
32354,L242088,u1019,m66,ROYCE,The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
32355,L242087,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
32356,L242085,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
32357,L242084,u1019,m66,ROYCE,You knew about us?
32358,L242083,u1022,m66,THE SPOOK,Thought you two were file-closed.

32362,L247504,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Me!? You where the one...
32363,L247503,u1031,m67,LUCY,"All that ""you gotta be vicious"" stuff you filled her head with."
32364,L247502,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,What?
32365,L247501,u1031,m67,LUCY,In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
32366,L247500,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Where's Audrey?
32367,L247499,u1031,m67,LUCY,What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
32368,L247498,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Who the hell are all these people?
32369,L247227,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Great. See ya then.
32370,L247226,u1031,m67,LUCY,Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
32371,L247167,u1031,m67,LUCY,"Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in this town. You gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes."
32372,L247166,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,"Hey, hey! I'm eating here!"
32373,L247165,u1031,m67,LUCY,"I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks..."
32374,L247160,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Big bites.
32375,L247159,u1031,m67,LUCY,Shut up. How can you eat like that?
32376,L247158,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,That's cuz I'm married to you.
32377,L247709,u1025,m67,AUDREY,No.
32378,L247708,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,"Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?"
32379,L247687,u1025,m67,AUDREY,But we can get to the west side faster.
32380,L247686,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
32381,L247685,u1025,m67,AUDREY,The JFK? In the rain!?
32382,L247684,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,"You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK."
32383,L247683,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway."
32384,L247650,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Oh yes he will.
32385,L247649,u1025,m67,AUDREY,He's not going to do it.
32386,L247616,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Only one way to find out.
32387,L247615,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Think we can fit up in there?
32388,L247587,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
32389,L247586,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Don't you think we have enough?
32390,L247529,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
32391,L247528,u1025,m67,AUDREY,What are you doing?
32392,L247524,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
32393,L247523,u1025,m67,AUDREY,What are you doing?
32394,L247520,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,"Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance."
32395,L247519,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Animal, I can't."
32396,L247518,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,"Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one."
32397,L247517,u1025,m67,AUDREY,My God. He's going after the nest.
32398,L247516,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
32399,L247515,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Yeah. Why are you asking?
32400,L247514,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
32401,L247513,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me."
32402,L247512,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,You made a mistake.
32403,L247511,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this."
32404,L247510,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,You okay?
32405,L247439,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,"We know, Audrey."
32406,L247438,u1025,m67,AUDREY,He stole my report! That's my report!
32407,L247222,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
32408,L247221,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?"
32409,L247194,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Nearly four years...
32410,L247193,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
32411,L247191,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun..."
32412,L247190,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,That why you dumped him?
32413,L247170,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Well, I can be tough if I want."
32414,L247169,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
32415,L247168,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?"
32416,L247164,u1025,m67,AUDREY,You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
32417,L247163,u1024,m67,ANIMAL,I like that image.
32418,L247720,u1034,m67,NICK,"Oh, just some insurance guy."
32419,L247719,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Who was that French guy, anyway."
32420,L247677,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Really? I'd like to find out.
32421,L247676,u1034,m67,NICK,You'd be surprised.
32422,L247675,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
32423,L247674,u1034,m67,NICK,Are you okay?
32424,L247659,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Oh my God! They're coming!
32425,L247658,u1034,m67,NICK,"If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape."
32426,L247641,u1034,m67,NICK,Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
32427,L247640,u1025,m67,AUDREY,The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
32428,L247639,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Our network covers the Ranger games.
32429,L247638,u1034,m67,NICK,How do you know?
32430,L247637,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here."
32431,L247635,u1025,m67,AUDREY,I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
32432,L247634,u1034,m67,NICK,Circuits are overloaded.
32433,L247631,u1034,m67,NICK,I was wrong.
32434,L247630,u1025,m67,AUDREY,I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
32435,L247629,u1034,m67,NICK,What are you doing here?
32436,L247457,u1034,m67,NICK,So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
32437,L247456,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure."
32438,L247455,u1034,m67,NICK,"I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you."
32439,L247454,u1025,m67,AUDREY,You never said it was off the record.
32440,L247453,u1034,m67,NICK,Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
32441,L247452,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
32442,L247387,u1034,m67,NICK,Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
32443,L247386,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Nesting?
32444,L247385,u1034,m67,NICK,"The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!"
32445,L247384,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?"
32446,L247383,u1034,m67,NICK,"Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy."
32447,L247382,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Are you sure?
32448,L247381,u1034,m67,NICK,...he's pregnant.
32449,L247379,u1025,m67,AUDREY,What else do you know about it?
32450,L247378,u1034,m67,NICK,I got pretty close.
32451,L247377,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
32452,L247376,u1034,m67,NICK,Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
32453,L247375,u1025,m67,AUDREY,And you think this creature is one of them?
32454,L247374,u1034,m67,NICK,I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
32455,L247373,u1025,m67,AUDREY,And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
32456,L247372,u1034,m67,NICK,"When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism."
32457,L247371,u1025,m67,AUDREY,I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
32458,L247369,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Sure. I'd like that.
32459,L247368,u1034,m67,NICK,Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
32460,L247367,u1025,m67,AUDREY,I'm sorry you feel that way.
32461,L247366,u1034,m67,NICK,Most people don't.
32462,L247365,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know."
32463,L247364,u1034,m67,NICK,"You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad."
32464,L247363,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"You're still mad at me, aren't you?"
32465,L247362,u1034,m67,NICK,"No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real ""boring"" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises..."
32466,L247361,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"So, you still picking apart cockroaches?"
32467,L247360,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Yeah, well..."
32468,L247359,u1034,m67,NICK,"You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am."
32469,L247358,u1025,m67,AUDREY,What?
32470,L247357,u1034,m67,NICK,So you made it.
32471,L247356,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"It's good to see you, Nick."
32472,L247355,u1034,m67,NICK,"Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?"
32473,L247354,u1025,m67,AUDREY,You must have quite some harem.
32474,L247353,u1034,m67,NICK,I'll take them all.
32475,L247277,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it."
32476,L247276,u1031,m67,LUCY,"Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job."
32477,L247275,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Wish me luck!
32478,L247266,u1031,m67,LUCY,I left my forgery kit back at the office.
32479,L247265,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?"
32480,L247264,u1031,m67,LUCY,Your old sweetheart?
32481,L247263,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
32482,L247262,u1031,m67,LUCY,What the hell are you doing?
32483,L247196,u1025,m67,AUDREY,That's the problem. He did.
32484,L247195,u1031,m67,LUCY,"Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him."
32485,L247189,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Nick Tatopoulos.
32486,L247188,u1031,m67,LUCY,Did Romeo have a name?
32487,L247176,u1025,m67,AUDREY,He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
32488,L247175,u1031,m67,LUCY,Who is he?
32489,L247174,u1025,m67,AUDREY,It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
32490,L247162,u1031,m67,LUCY,He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
32491,L247161,u1025,m67,AUDREY,I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
32492,L247157,u1031,m67,LUCY,"Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks."
32493,L247156,u1025,m67,AUDREY,My life sucks.
32494,L247090,u1031,m67,LUCY,Speak of the devil.
32495,L247089,u1025,m67,AUDREY,And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
32496,L247273,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"You're kidding, right?"
32497,L247272,u1029,m67,KID,Five bucks.
32498,L247271,u1025,m67,AUDREY,The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
32499,L247270,u1029,m67,KID,What do I get?
32500,L247269,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Can I use some?
32501,L247268,u1029,m67,KID,What's it to you?
32502,L247267,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?"
32503,L247707,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit."
32504,L247706,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,"I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me."
32505,L247705,u1025,m67,AUDREY,We? I don't think so.
32506,L247704,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,"We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!"
32507,L247234,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,"Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?"
32508,L247233,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"You don't understand, I can get us information..."
32509,L247232,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,Not now. You got my bag?
32510,L247231,u1025,m67,AUDREY,I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
32511,L247230,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,What?
32512,L247229,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Caiman, wait. Take me with you."
32513,L247106,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,It's your choice.
32514,L247105,u1025,m67,AUDREY,I can't.
32515,L247104,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,So have dinner with me tonight.
32516,L247103,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace."
32517,L247102,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,Call me Charlie.
32518,L247101,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Mr. Caiman...
32519,L247100,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,And you're beautiful...
32520,L247099,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Mr. Caiman, you're married."
32521,L247097,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
32522,L247096,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
32523,L247095,u1025,m67,AUDREY,"Just tell me, did you talk with him?"
32524,L247094,u1026,m67,CAIMAN,This is not the place...
32525,L247093,u1025,m67,AUDREY,Did you talk with Humphries?
32526,L247446,u1027,m67,ELSIE,I'll try.
32527,L247445,u1034,m67,NICK,Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
32528,L247444,u1034,m67,NICK,Me too.
32529,L247443,u1027,m67,ELSIE,I'm sorry about all this.
32530,L247206,u1034,m67,NICK,I don't think so.
32531,L247205,u1027,m67,ELSIE,Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
32532,L247153,u1034,m67,NICK,"More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region."
32533,L247152,u1027,m67,ELSIE,Hence the radiation.
32534,L247114,u1034,m67,NICK,"Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?"
32535,L247113,u1027,m67,ELSIE,"Well, I think you're cute."
32536,L247112,u1034,m67,NICK,"Not for a long time, now."
32537,L247111,u1027,m67,ELSIE,You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
32538,L247110,u1034,m67,NICK,No. Perhaps I work too much.
32539,L247109,u1027,m67,ELSIE,Really? A girlfriend then?
32540,L247108,u1034,m67,NICK,"Oh, I'm not married."
32541,L247107,u1027,m67,ELSIE,Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
32542,L247081,u1027,m67,ELSIE,"Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist."
32543,L247080,u1034,m67,NICK,Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
32544,L247613,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,"Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!"
32545,L247612,u1028,m67,JEAN-CLAUDE,They didn't make it.
32546,L247611,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,Where's Luc and Pierre?
32547,L247610,u1028,m67,JEAN-CLAUDE,We've secured the doors on both levels.
32548,L247493,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,That is when we will go in.
32549,L247492,u1028,m67,JEAN-CLAUDE,They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
32550,L247428,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,"Allez, allez!"
32551,L247427,u1028,m67,JEAN-CLAUDE,Merde!
32552,L247298,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,"Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!"
32553,L247297,u1030,m67,LT. ANDERSON,"And how should we do that, Sir?"
32554,L247296,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,Have them sealed off.
32555,L247295,u1030,m67,LT. ANDERSON,"Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them."
32556,L247294,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
32557,L247293,u1030,m67,LT. ANDERSON,When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
32558,L247124,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,Get your people out of there or I will.
32559,L247123,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,"Major, what do you think could have done this?"
32560,L247122,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
32561,L247121,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,That is our job.
32562,L247120,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,You're fast.
32563,L247119,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,"CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report."
32564,L247117,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,They are with me!
32565,L247116,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,"Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there."
32566,L247436,u1034,m67,NICK,"No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it."
32567,L247435,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,You gave them the tape?
32568,L247414,u1034,m67,NICK,It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
32569,L247413,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
32570,L247412,u1034,m67,NICK,"No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population."
32571,L247408,u1034,m67,NICK,"Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has."
32572,L247407,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,"You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking..."
32573,L247406,u1034,m67,NICK,"Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled."
32574,L247301,u1034,m67,NICK,"When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out."
32575,L247300,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,What are you suggesting?
32576,L247299,u1034,m67,NICK,"You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal."
32577,L247151,u1034,m67,NICK,What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
32578,L247150,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,"Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is."
32579,L247149,u1034,m67,NICK,"The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur."
32580,L247076,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
32581,L247075,u1034,m67,NICK,Somebody must have seen it.
32582,L247074,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
32583,L247073,u1034,m67,NICK,But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
32584,L247072,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,That's right.
32585,L247071,u1034,m67,NICK,That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
32586,L247068,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,You're standing on it.
32587,L247067,u1034,m67,NICK,What sample?
32588,L247066,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
32589,L247065,u1034,m67,NICK,"They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them."
32590,L247064,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,"Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big."
32591,L247063,u1034,m67,NICK,It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
32592,L247062,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,"No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out."
32593,L247061,u1034,m67,NICK,The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
32594,L247060,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,"Yeah, you're the worm guy."
32595,L247059,u1034,m67,NICK,Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
32596,L247058,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,We know.
32597,L247057,u1034,m67,NICK,"Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field."
32598,L247056,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
32599,L247055,u1034,m67,NICK,"You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions."
32600,L247054,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,Follow me.
32601,L247053,u1034,m67,NICK,"Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?"
32602,L247052,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
32603,L247051,u1034,m67,NICK,It's Tatopoulos.
32604,L247050,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
32605,L247604,u1033,m67,MAYOR,You don't have the authority to do that.
32606,L247603,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
32607,L247601,u1033,m67,MAYOR,That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
32608,L247600,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
32609,L247599,u1033,m67,MAYOR,Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
32610,L247405,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,"That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood."
32611,L247404,u1033,m67,MAYOR,Last time you didn't even scratch it!
32612,L247403,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,"General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down."
32613,L247286,u1033,m67,MAYOR,But you don't know for sure!
32614,L247285,u1032,m67,MAJOR HICKS,We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
32615,L247718,u1034,m67,NICK,Wait.  Au revoir.
32616,L247717,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,"I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend."
32617,L247716,u1034,m67,NICK,I understand.
32618,L247714,u1034,m67,NICK,Where are you?
32619,L247713,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,It's Raymond.
32620,L247712,u1034,m67,NICK,Hello?
32621,L247626,u1034,m67,NICK,It's okay. I know her.
32622,L247625,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,Who the hell are you?
32623,L247608,u1034,m67,NICK,I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
32624,L247607,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,What'd they say?
32625,L247596,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
32626,L247595,u1034,m67,NICK,How do I do that?
32627,L247594,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
32628,L247584,u1034,m67,NICK,Good idea.
32629,L247583,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,I think we should leave now.
32630,L247561,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,You were right.
32631,L247560,u1034,m67,NICK,Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
32632,L247541,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
32633,L247540,u1034,m67,NICK,They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
32634,L247526,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,Makes us look more American.
32635,L247525,u1034,m67,NICK,What's with the chewing gum?
32636,L247497,u1034,m67,NICK,Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.
32637,L247496,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,So you're in?
32638,L247495,u1034,m67,NICK,"Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it."
32639,L247491,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
32640,L247490,u1034,m67,NICK,Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
32641,L247489,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
32642,L247488,u1034,m67,NICK,Sure.
32643,L247487,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
32644,L247485,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,I am not permitted to speak of such things.
32645,L247484,u1034,m67,NICK,So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
32646,L247483,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
32647,L247482,u1034,m67,NICK,How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
32648,L247478,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,"We, have already taken care of them."
32649,L247477,u1034,m67,NICK,"Oh, my bags. I've checked them in."
32650,L247476,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
32651,L247475,u1034,m67,NICK,Why do you need that?
32652,L247474,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,I need you to trust me.
32653,L247473,u1034,m67,NICK,Why are you telling this to me?

32655,L247471,u1034,m67,NICK,Are you sure? How do you know?
32656,L247470,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
32657,L247469,u1034,m67,NICK,Oh.
32658,L247468,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,It's the French Secret Service.
32659,L247467,u1034,m67,NICK,Sounds like a big company.
32660,L247466,u1035,m67,RAYMOND,"SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond."

32666,L229753,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,"You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me."
32667,L229752,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"Don't speak, Quellek."
32668,L229751,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,"... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I..."

32670,L229749,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
32671,L229748,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
32672,L229746,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,I'm... I'm shot.
32673,L229745,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified."
32674,L229740,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Open.
32675,L229739,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
32676,L229647,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
32677,L229646,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
32678,L229645,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Quellek. What are you doing in there?
32679,L229644,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,"Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!"
32680,L229345,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,"Right... Sorry, sir."
32681,L229344,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Uh uh! What did we talk about?

32683,L229342,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Thanks.
32684,L229341,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,"Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density."
32685,L229133,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,"Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy."
32686,L229132,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Is that the bathroom?
32687,L229131,u1047,m68,QUELLEK,"Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible..."

32734,L229101,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
32735,L229100,u1042,m68,JASON,At ease men.
32736,L229093,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"""Just!?"""
32737,L229092,u1042,m68,JASON,Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
32738,L229044,u1042,m68,JASON,COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
32739,L229043,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"God, what an ass."
32740,L228944,u1042,m68,JASON,Leadership....

32742,L228942,u1042,m68,JASON,I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
32743,L228907,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,...Damn you!  Damn you!

32745,L228905,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,I won't and nothing you say-
32746,L228904,u1042,m68,JASON,You WILL go out there.
32747,L228899,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
32748,L228898,u1042,m68,JASON,"Come on, old friend..."
32749,L229423,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'"
32750,L229422,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"You have a better plan, Alex?"
32751,L229421,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense."
32752,L229385,u1049,m68,TOMMY,...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
32753,L229384,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,And note the sucked in gut.

32755,L229367,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"You think you could do better ""Laredo?"""
32756,L229366,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second."
32757,L229365,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Shut up.
32758,L229364,u1049,m68,TOMMY,You were holding it upside down weren't you?
32759,L229294,u1049,m68,TOMMY,The engines are dead. We're drifting.
32760,L229293,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,What's happened?
32761,L229283,u1049,m68,TOMMY,They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
32762,L229282,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
32763,L229214,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!"
32764,L229213,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,He wants to THINK!?
32765,L229089,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"Jason, what have you gotten us into?"
32766,L229088,u1049,m68,TOMMY,What the hell is going on?!!?
32767,L228877,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
32768,L228876,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"Settle down, Alex..."
32769,L228873,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,I played Richard III...
32770,L228872,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Not again...
32771,L228861,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?"
32772,L228860,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,He's a twit!
32773,L229891,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159"
32774,L229890,u1041,m68,GWEN,He always has to make the big entrance.
32775,L229487,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Yes you did.
32776,L229486,u1041,m68,GWEN,No I didn't.
32777,L229485,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"Back there. You said ""the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."""
32778,L229484,u1041,m68,GWEN,What?
32779,L229483,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"You said ""the Commander."
32780,L229470,u1041,m68,GWEN,Down there.
32781,L229469,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
32782,L229448,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
32783,L229447,u1041,m68,GWEN,Those blue things ate everybody here?
32784,L229432,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Nobody was WATCHING?
32785,L229431,u1041,m68,GWEN,I don't know.
32786,L229395,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Could they be the miners?
32787,L229394,u1041,m68,GWEN,Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
32788,L229303,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,To see if there's a pub.
32789,L229302,u1041,m68,GWEN,Alex? Where are you going?
32790,L229301,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"""Go into the cloud! ..."

32792,L229287,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
32793,L229279,u1041,m68,GWEN,The ships are gaining...
32794,L229278,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,May I get the check?
32795,L229267,u1041,m68,GWEN,Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
32796,L229266,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,We heard it the first time!
32797,L229085,u1041,m68,GWEN,All this from watching the.. historical records?
32798,L229084,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"Oh my god, It's real."
32799,L228979,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring."
32800,L228978,u1041,m68,GWEN,I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
32801,L228977,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,A boy comes to the door.
32802,L228976,u1041,m68,GWEN,You could order something in.
32803,L228975,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
32804,L228974,u1041,m68,GWEN,Why didn't you stop at the market?
32805,L228973,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,"Oh good, there's nothing to eat."
32806,L228897,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Oh can't I? Watch me!
32807,L228896,u1041,m68,GWEN,Alex you can't -just leave.
32808,L228871,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,Dear God.... How did I come to this?
32809,L228870,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Oh Alex, get away from that thing..."
32810,L228865,u1041,m68,GWEN,The guy is terminally selfish!
32811,L228864,u1036,m68,ALEXANDER,He's a miserable twit!
32812,L229659,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable."
32813,L229658,u1043,m68,KYLE,I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
32814,L229657,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?"
32815,L229656,u1043,m68,KYLE,Oh.  Okay.
32816,L229655,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads."
32817,L229654,u1043,m68,KYLE,Hi Brandon.
32818,L229036,u1037,m68,BRANDON,He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
32819,L229035,u1043,m68,KYLE,"He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!"
32820,L229765,u1037,m68,BRANDON,Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
32821,L229764,u1042,m68,JASON,That's It?
32822,L229763,u1037,m68,BRANDON,Raise the glass and push the blue button.
32823,L229762,u1042,m68,JASON,I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
32824,L229730,u1037,m68,BRANDON,Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
32825,L229729,u1042,m68,JASON,What?  Up?
32826,L229728,u1037,m68,BRANDON,Up.
32827,L229727,u1037,m68,BRANDON,Go. They're off again.
32828,L229725,u1037,m68,BRANDON,GO Commander.
32829,L229724,u1042,m68,JASON,Shit! Go!
32830,L229723,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Lt. Madison, GO."
32831,L229722,u1042,m68,JASON,"No, wait, are you-"
32832,L229721,u1037,m68,BRANDON,Wait two seconds then go.
32833,L229720,u1042,m68,JASON,"Okay, now. But-"
32834,L229719,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom..."
32835,L229707,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit."
32836,L229706,u1042,m68,JASON,BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
32837,L229700,u1037,m68,BRANDON,My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
32838,L229699,u1042,m68,JASON,How did you come to that conclusion?
32839,L229698,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past."
32840,L229697,u1042,m68,JASON,But you don't?
32841,L229696,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds."
32842,L229695,u1042,m68,JASON,What do you mean?
32843,L229694,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Well, that's the big question, isn't it?"
32844,L229693,u1042,m68,JASON,What does the Omega 13 do?
32845,L229692,u1037,m68,BRANDON,Yes Commander?
32846,L229691,u1042,m68,JASON,"Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know..."
32847,L229670,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Okay, that's where you want to be."
32848,L229669,u1042,m68,JASON,Yes...?
32849,L229668,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Okay, so do you see a door marked ""CORE UNIT?"" Should be down at the far end to your left."
32850,L229667,u1042,m68,JASON,We'd never have the budget for this.
32851,L229666,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing."
32852,L229665,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship."
32853,L229664,u1042,m68,JASON,"Okay...  Okay, now what."
32854,L229663,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent..."
32855,L229653,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive."
32856,L229652,u1042,m68,JASON,"Okay, we got it."
32857,L229642,u1042,m68,JASON,Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
32858,L229641,u1037,m68,BRANDON,I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
32859,L229640,u1042,m68,JASON,"It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real."
32860,L229639,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-"
32861,L229638,u1042,m68,JASON,It's okay. Listen-
32862,L229637,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but..."
32863,L229636,u1042,m68,JASON,"Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you..."
32864,L229635,u1037,m68,BRANDON,Brandon.
32865,L229634,u1042,m68,JASON,"What's  your name, son?"
32866,L229633,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Oh... Oh, I see. Oh."
32867,L229632,u1042,m68,JASON,We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
32868,L229631,u1037,m68,BRANDON,... Yes?
32869,L228970,u1042,m68,JASON,There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
32870,L228969,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Yes but, we were wondering-"
32871,L228968,u1042,m68,JASON,"It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?"
32872,L228967,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Commander, as I was saying... In ""The Quasar Dilemma"", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?"
32873,L228949,u1042,m68,JASON,Excuse me guys.
32874,L228948,u1037,m68,BRANDON,"Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In ""The Quasar Dilemma"", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-"

32881,L229311,u1041,m68,GWEN,We need another one.
32882,L229310,u1038,m68,COMPUTER,Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
32883,L229307,u1041,m68,GWEN,It's fractured...
32884,L229306,u1038,m68,COMPUTER,The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
32885,L229305,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?"
32886,L229265,u1041,m68,GWEN,The enemy is matching velocity.

32889,L229256,u1038,m68,COMPUTER,The ship is sustaining structural damage.
32890,L229142,u1041,m68,GWEN,I never get tired of that joke.
32891,L229141,u1038,m68,COMPUTER,There is no weather in space.

32893,L229139,u1038,m68,COMPUTER,Yes?
32894,L229138,u1041,m68,GWEN,"I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from ""historical document"" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?"
32895,L228849,u1041,m68,GWEN,We're getting major structural damage.
32896,L228848,u1038,m68,COMPUTER,Structural damage at 68 percent.
32897,L229115,u1039,m68,FRED,OK!
32898,L229114,u1046,m68,NERVOUS TECH,So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
32899,L229113,u1039,m68,FRED,Covalent... Right. So...
32900,L229112,u1046,m68,NERVOUS TECH,"What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!..."
32901,L229111,u1039,m68,FRED,... What does that mean?
32902,L229110,u1046,m68,NERVOUS TECH,That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
32903,L229109,u1039,m68,FRED,U.... What do you think?
32904,L229554,u1042,m68,JASON,Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
32905,L229553,u1039,m68,FRED,As good as Hopkins?
32906,L229549,u1039,m68,FRED,You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
32907,L229548,u1042,m68,JASON,"Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this."
32908,L229546,u1042,m68,JASON,Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
32909,L229545,u1039,m68,FRED,"No, I'll kill you. ."
32910,L229498,u1042,m68,JASON,I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
32911,L229497,u1039,m68,FRED,Right.
32912,L229496,u1042,m68,JASON,The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
32913,L229427,u1039,m68,FRED,"No, no... I'll think on it..."
32914,L229426,u1042,m68,JASON,"Never mind, Fred...."
32915,L229425,u1039,m68,FRED,A hologram...
32916,L229339,u1042,m68,JASON,"I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely."
32917,L229338,u1039,m68,FRED,"Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?"
32918,L229678,u1039,m68,FRED,"Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?"
32919,L229677,u1040,m68,GUY,"I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward."
32920,L229676,u1039,m68,FRED,It's suicide.
32921,L229675,u1040,m68,GUY,"Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape."
32922,L229674,u1039,m68,FRED,We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
32923,L229481,u1040,m68,GUY,Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
32924,L229480,u1039,m68,FRED,...The digital conveyor.
32925,L229399,u1040,m68,GUY,I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
32926,L229398,u1039,m68,FRED,"You Okay, Alex?"
32927,L228930,u1039,m68,FRED,"Oh I make it up. Use lots of ""k""s and ""v""s."
32928,L228929,u1040,m68,GUY,How do you remember this stuff?
32929,L229416,u1040,m68,GUY,"We're doing episode 31, Jason?"
32930,L229415,u1041,m68,GWEN,How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
32931,L229408,u1041,m68,GWEN,Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
32932,L229407,u1040,m68,GUY,I am SO SICK of being right.
32933,L229401,u1040,m68,GUY,Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
32934,L229400,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Oh, they're so cute."
32935,L229392,u1040,m68,GUY,Something BAD happened here.
32936,L229391,u1041,m68,GWEN,Where are the miners?
32937,L229356,u1040,m68,GUY,"Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just ""CREWMAN #6""!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?"
32938,L229355,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it."
32939,L229191,u1041,m68,GWEN,The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
32940,L229190,u1040,m68,GUY,The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
32941,L229082,u1040,m68,GUY,It's ... incredible.
32942,L229081,u1041,m68,GWEN,THAT'S why you built this ship?
32943,L229075,u1041,m68,GWEN,You... know us?
32944,L229074,u1040,m68,GUY,"""Crewman #6""... Call me Guy."
32945,L228923,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement."
32946,L228922,u1040,m68,GUY,"Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know."
32947,L229808,u1042,m68,JASON,No. Keep all energy to the armor.
32948,L229807,u1040,m68,GUY,"We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?"
32949,L229536,u1042,m68,JASON,"A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'"
32950,L229535,u1040,m68,GUY,"I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?..."
32951,L229420,u1040,m68,GUY,BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
32952,L229419,u1042,m68,JASON,"It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!"
32953,L229418,u1040,m68,GUY,"Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?"
32954,L229417,u1042,m68,JASON,It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
32955,L229388,u1042,m68,JASON,"Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?"
32956,L229387,u1040,m68,GUY,"That's it, that's what's going to kill me."
32957,L229370,u1042,m68,JASON,"All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control."
32958,L229369,u1040,m68,GUY,We're screwed... We're so screwed...
32959,L229354,u1040,m68,GUY,"No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?"
32960,L229353,u1042,m68,JASON,It's... I don't know.
32961,L229352,u1040,m68,GUY,"Yeah, what is it?"
32962,L229351,u1042,m68,JASON,Your last name.
32963,L229350,u1040,m68,GUY,"Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?"
32964,L229349,u1042,m68,JASON,"Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?"
32965,L229261,u1042,m68,JASON,"We should have a turbo. I'm always saying ""activate turbo boosters"", right?..."
32966,L229260,u1040,m68,GUY,They're still behind us...
32967,L229240,u1042,m68,JASON,All right. Put me back on with him.
32968,L229239,u1040,m68,GUY,...Okay
32969,L229854,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"We made it. Commander, we made it.'"
32970,L229853,u1040,m68,GUY,~e're alive!

32972,L229840,u1040,m68,GUY,We're alive!
32973,L229442,u1049,m68,TOMMY,I think he just likes pointing at things.
32974,L229441,u1040,m68,GUY,Not a clue. You?
32975,L229440,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?"
32976,L229430,u1040,m68,GUY,Where'd they go? Back inside?
32977,L229429,u1049,m68,TOMMY,They're gone.
32978,L229414,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire."
32979,L229413,u1040,m68,GUY,We're doing episode 31?
32980,L229412,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"""Assault on Voltareck III.""  Episode... 31 I think."
32981,L229174,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"Hey, YOU want to drive?"
32982,L229173,u1040,m68,GUY,More to the left... Stay parallel...
32983,L228921,u1040,m68,GUY,"Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  ""Crewman #6?"""
32984,L228920,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
32985,L228919,u1040,m68,GUY,Hi everybody.
32986,L229824,u1042,m68,JASON,"TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!"
32987,L229823,u1041,m68,GWEN,never doubted you for a second.
32988,L229814,u1042,m68,JASON,Mark 12.
32989,L229813,u1041,m68,GWEN,He's accelerating to Mark 6.
32990,L229718,u1041,m68,GWEN,Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
32991,L229717,u1042,m68,JASON,Because it was on the show!
32992,L229716,u1041,m68,GWEN,We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
32993,L229715,u1042,m68,JASON,Gwen...
32994,L229714,u1041,m68,GWEN,What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
32995,L229651,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Wait... Jason, Here!..."
32996,L229650,u1042,m68,JASON,There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
32997,L229623,u1042,m68,JASON,No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
32998,L229622,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either."
32999,L229621,u1042,m68,JASON,Right.
33000,L229620,u1041,m68,GWEN,So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
33001,L229523,u1042,m68,JASON,What the hell are you talking about?
33002,L229522,u1041,m68,GWEN,Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
33003,L229520,u1041,m68,GWEN,Turn on the translation circuit.
33004,L229519,u1042,m68,JASON,"Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?"
33005,L229502,u1041,m68,GWEN,Nothing. Hold please.
33006,L229501,u1042,m68,JASON,What?  What did he say?
33007,L229495,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there."
33008,L229494,u1042,m68,JASON,Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
33009,L229493,u1041,m68,GWEN,Thank God. Are you okay?
33010,L229492,u1042,m68,JASON,"Yes. Yes, I'm here!"
33011,L229491,u1041,m68,GWEN,Jason.. Can you hear me?
33012,L229452,u1042,m68,JASON,Will you stop RIDING ME?!
33013,L229451,u1041,m68,GWEN,Clenched jaw...
33014,L229444,u1042,m68,JASON,It helps.
33015,L229443,u1041,m68,GWEN,"How does the rolling help, actually?"
33016,L229411,u1041,m68,GWEN,Why does this sound so familiar?
33017,L229410,u1042,m68,JASON,"All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter."
33018,L229383,u1042,m68,JASON,Don't be ridiculous.
33019,L229382,u1041,m68,GWEN,You're playing your good side.
33020,L229373,u1041,m68,GWEN,I could have held on to YOU! ...
33021,L229372,u1042,m68,JASON,Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
33022,L229371,u1041,m68,GWEN,Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
33023,L229315,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?"
33024,L229314,u1042,m68,JASON,Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
33025,L229309,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Computer, can it be repaired?"
33026,L229308,u1042,m68,JASON,Can it be repaired?
33027,L229296,u1041,m68,GWEN,"No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god."
33028,L229295,u1042,m68,JASON,Are they behind us?
33029,L229275,u1041,m68,GWEN,I don't think that's a cloud...
33030,L229274,u1042,m68,JASON,Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
33031,L229245,u1042,m68,JASON,"Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying..."
33032,L229244,u1041,m68,GWEN,"I thought It was the ""We're dead"" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???"
33033,L229243,u1042,m68,JASON,I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
33034,L229238,u1042,m68,JASON,"You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?"
33035,L229237,u1041,m68,GWEN,JASON...
33036,L229236,u1042,m68,JASON,"We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?"
33037,L229235,u1041,m68,GWEN,Jason..
33038,L229234,u1042,m68,JASON,"All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly."
33039,L229221,u1042,m68,JASON,"Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here."
33040,L229220,u1041,m68,GWEN,There's nobody here. Jason...
33041,L229212,u1042,m68,JASON,Let me think. I need time to think.
33042,L229211,u1041,m68,GWEN,"We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW."
33043,L229157,u1042,m68,JASON,"Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!"
33044,L229156,u1041,m68,GWEN,We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
33045,L229155,u1042,m68,JASON,Hey... Hey where are you going?
33046,L229154,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING..."
33047,L229153,u1042,m68,JASON,"It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it."
33048,L229152,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!"
33049,L229151,u1042,m68,JASON,Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
33050,L229150,u1041,m68,GWEN,Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
33051,L229149,u1042,m68,JASON,Tell them? About...
33052,L229148,u1041,m68,GWEN,Wait. When are you going to tell them?
33053,L229147,u1042,m68,JASON,"C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck."
33054,L229146,u1041,m68,GWEN,On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
33055,L229145,u1042,m68,JASON,But I'm the Commander!
33056,L229144,u1041,m68,GWEN,Only answers to me.
33057,L229143,u1042,m68,JASON,Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
33058,L229137,u1042,m68,JASON,"Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-"
33059,L229136,u1041,m68,GWEN,"One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'"
33060,L229135,u1042,m68,JASON,It's Jason...
33061,L229048,u1041,m68,GWEN,"You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?..."
33062,L229047,u1042,m68,JASON,"This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?..."
33063,L228955,u1042,m68,JASON,You smiled at me.
33064,L228954,u1041,m68,GWEN,What?
33065,L228891,u1042,m68,JASON,"What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander."
33066,L228890,u1041,m68,GWEN,How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
33067,L228889,u1042,m68,JASON,A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
33068,L229881,u1049,m68,TOMMY,I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
33069,L229880,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Tommy, look!  Those lights..."
33070,L229801,u1041,m68,GWEN,What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
33071,L229800,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Closer?  I can try.
33072,L229799,u1049,m68,TOMMY,JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
33073,L229489,u1041,m68,GWEN,Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
33074,L229488,u1049,m68,TOMMY,I heard it too.
33075,L229479,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... ""Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"""
33076,L229478,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead."
33077,L229477,u1041,m68,GWEN,"We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back."
33078,L229468,u1049,m68,TOMMY,I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
33079,L229467,u1041,m68,GWEN,Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
33080,L229320,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"Sure, no problem."
33081,L229319,u1041,m68,GWEN,"I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?"
33082,L229318,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"You know, that's really getting annoying."
33083,L229054,u1041,m68,GWEN,"I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!"
33084,L229053,u1049,m68,TOMMY,You should have let me hit him.
33085,L229046,u1041,m68,GWEN,"Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it."
33086,L229045,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"That's it, It's go time."
33087,L228941,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Almost as much as he loves himself.
33088,L228940,u1041,m68,GWEN,"You gotta admit, they do love him."
33089,L228888,u1049,m68,TOMMY,You are so full of shit
33090,L228887,u1041,m68,GWEN,Unbelievable.
33091,L228863,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"Tomorrow morning, before the store opening."
33092,L228862,u1041,m68,GWEN,You're kidding. When for?
33093,L228859,u1041,m68,GWEN,This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
33094,L228858,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
33095,L229812,u1048,m68,SARRIS,"This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home."
33096,L229811,u1042,m68,JASON,"Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy."
33097,L229584,u1048,m68,SARRIS,"Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?..."
33098,L229583,u1042,m68,JASON,We.. We lie.
33099,L229582,u1048,m68,SARRIS,Simpler.
33100,L229581,u1042,m68,JASON,We pretend...
33101,L229580,u1048,m68,SARRIS,"Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists."
33102,L229579,u1042,m68,JASON,My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
33103,L229575,u1042,m68,JASON,Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
33104,L229574,u1048,m68,SARRIS,Explain -
33105,L229573,u1042,m68,JASON,"Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything."
33106,L229572,u1048,m68,SARRIS,Wait. What did you say?
33107,L229570,u1048,m68,SARRIS,"Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?"
33108,L229569,u1042,m68,JASON,No! I swear I don't know! Please!
33109,L229568,u1048,m68,SARRIS,Prepare a tear harness for the female...
33110,L229567,u1042,m68,JASON,"Stop, please! I don't know!"
33111,L229566,u1048,m68,SARRIS,Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
33112,L229565,u1042,m68,JASON,I don't know.
33113,L229564,u1048,m68,SARRIS,"Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13."
33114,L229563,u1042,m68,JASON,Yes.
33115,L229233,u1042,m68,JASON,All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
33116,L229232,u1048,m68,SARRIS,You have ten seconds.
33117,L229231,u1042,m68,JASON,"Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even..."
33118,L229230,u1048,m68,SARRIS,Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
33119,L229229,u1042,m68,JASON,"Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that."
33120,L229228,u1048,m68,SARRIS,Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
33121,L229227,u1042,m68,JASON,Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
33122,L229011,u1042,m68,JASON,"Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer."
33123,L229010,u1048,m68,SARRIS,"First, I require the Omega 13... Second-"
33124,L229834,u1042,m68,JASON,You can oc that?
33125,L229833,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,"The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?"
33126,L229591,u1042,m68,JASON,It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
33127,L229590,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,But...Why?
33128,L229589,u1042,m68,JASON,Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
33129,L229588,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,"But... Inside, I have seen-"
33130,L229587,u1042,m68,JASON,"A model, only as big as this."
33131,L229586,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,But there it is!...
33132,L229585,u1042,m68,JASON,"I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip."
33133,L229336,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,"We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris."
33134,L229335,u1042,m68,JASON,Well... Sort of...
33135,L229334,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,"""Deception..."" ""Lies."""
33136,L229323,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,"We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship..."
33137,L229322,u1042,m68,JASON,You what?.. What are you talking about?
33138,L229321,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
33139,L229277,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
33140,L229276,u1042,m68,JASON,Mathesar? What is that?
33141,L229217,u1042,m68,JASON,"Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew."
33142,L229216,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,Commander...
33143,L229205,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
33144,L229204,u1042,m68,JASON,Former Commander?
33145,L229203,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,Our former Commander was not... Strong.
33146,L229202,u1042,m68,JASON,Then how did he find out about the device?
33147,L229201,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,"NO, Thank God he has not."
33148,L229200,u1042,m68,JASON,Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
33149,L229179,u1042,m68,JASON,"Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!"
33150,L229178,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
33151,L229096,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,... Maintenance facility...
33152,L229095,u1042,m68,JASON,It's perfectly safe. I promise.
33153,L229094,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,Weapons storage...
33154,L229027,u1042,m68,JASON,It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
33155,L229026,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,"How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people."
33156,L229025,u1042,m68,JASON,Thanks
33157,L229024,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,An interstellar vox.
33158,L229023,u1042,m68,JASON,"I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call..."
33159,L229022,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
33160,L229021,u1042,m68,JASON,"Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels."
33161,L229020,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,But what if Sarris survives?
33162,L229019,u1042,m68,JASON,Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
33163,L229018,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,Theramin.
33164,L229017,u1042,m68,JASON,Right. Long live... What's your planet?
33165,L229016,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
33166,L229015,u1042,m68,JASON,"Yeah. ""Earth."" Time to get back to ""Earth,"" kids."
33167,L229014,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,You... You mean Earth?
33168,L229013,u1042,m68,JASON,Home.
33169,L229012,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,Commander?... Where are you... going?
33170,L229000,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,As you wish.
33171,L228999,u1042,m68,JASON,Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
33172,L228998,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
33173,L228983,u1042,m68,JASON,"Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on."
33174,L228982,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,"Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine."
33175,L228959,u1042,m68,JASON,"Catch me later, okay?"
33176,L228958,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,"I... certainly, but-"
33177,L228957,u1042,m68,JASON,"Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these"
33178,L228956,u1045,m68,MATHESAR,"Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance..."
33179,L229879,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal..."
33180,L229878,u1042,m68,JASON,"Hold course, Laredo!"
33181,L229839,u1042,m68,JASON,"Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao."
33182,L229838,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Commander?... Call me Laredo?
33183,L229837,u1042,m68,JASON,"Let's do it, Tommy."
33184,L229794,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Pedal to the metal...
33185,L229793,u1042,m68,JASON,Pedal to the metal Tommy...
33186,L229618,u1042,m68,JASON,"Practice driving, Tommy."
33187,L229617,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Jason? What about me? What do I do?
33188,L229616,u1042,m68,JASON,"All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time."
33189,L229558,u1042,m68,JASON,"We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry"
33190,L229557,u1049,m68,TOMMY,NO NO NO.
33191,L229534,u1042,m68,JASON,It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
33192,L229533,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots."
33193,L229532,u1042,m68,JASON,It doesn't have eyes.
33194,L229531,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
33195,L229508,u1042,m68,JASON,Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
33196,L229507,u1049,m68,TOMMY,How about the pig-lizard?
33197,L229506,u1042,m68,JASON,Okay... On what?
33198,L229461,u1042,m68,JASON,"Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!"
33199,L229460,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Sorry Guys... It just went off.
33200,L229439,u1042,m68,JASON,"Okay, let's go."
33201,L229438,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"Oh, right, sorry."
33202,L229437,u1042,m68,JASON,"Tommy, we have these..."
33203,L229436,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"Okay, I'll do this...  ""Caw Caw!"""
33204,L229435,u1042,m68,JASON,Anything.
33205,L229434,u1049,m68,TOMMY,What kind of signal?
33206,L229433,u1042,m68,JASON,"All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back."
33207,L229281,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Oh god...
33208,L229280,u1042,m68,JASON,"Do your best, Tommy..."
33209,L229263,u1042,m68,JASON,Push It. Hold it down.
33210,L229262,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Could be this.
33211,L229259,u1049,m68,TOMMY,It's as far as it goes!
33212,L229258,u1042,m68,JASON,Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
33213,L229254,u1042,m68,JASON,Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
33214,L229253,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Where?
33215,L229197,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Why don't you just turn it on and see?
33216,L229196,u1042,m68,JASON,"Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either."
33217,L229170,u1042,m68,JASON,"They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant..."
33218,L229169,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Excuse me?
33219,L229161,u1042,m68,JASON,I think we're going to exit the space port.
33220,L229160,u1049,m68,TOMMY,What's going on?
33221,L229071,u1042,m68,JASON,Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
33222,L229070,u1049,m68,TOMMY,Wh... Where are we?
33223,L229069,u1042,m68,JASON,"That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps."
33224,L228946,u1042,m68,JASON,And determination.
33225,L228945,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-"
33226,L228886,u1042,m68,JASON,"I didn't say that.  I said ""wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together."" That's what I said."
33227,L228885,u1049,m68,TOMMY,"You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'"

33229,L229805,u1044,m68,LATHE,Because they're coming right at us.
33230,L229804,u1048,m68,SARRIS,WHAT? WH
33231,L229803,u1048,m68,SARRIS,Get oacK on their tail.
33232,L229802,u1044,m68,LATHE,"enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are"
33233,L229686,u1048,m68,SARRIS,Find them.

33235,L229684,u1048,m68,SARRIS,Find them.
33236,L229595,u1044,m68,LATHE,The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
33237,L229594,u1048,m68,SARRIS,"Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain."
33238,L229285,u1048,m68,SARRIS,"Patience, Lt. . Patience."
33239,L229284,u1044,m68,LATHE,"Continue forward, sir?"
33240,L232767,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
33241,L232766,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
33242,L232582,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,What does she see in them?
33243,L232581,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins."
33244,L232580,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,I wish she was beneath me.
33245,L232579,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid."
33246,L232578,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?"
33247,L232575,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,They always say that.
33248,L232574,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,Some say that Hessians are invincible.
33249,L232860,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this."
33250,L232859,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see."
33251,L232858,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"You go too far, Benedict."
33252,L232857,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
33253,L232856,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
33254,L232855,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved."
33255,L232787,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me."
33256,L232786,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
33257,L232785,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
33258,L232784,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"There, then, you can have sort of a normal life."
33259,L232783,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
33260,L232782,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt."
33261,L232781,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
33262,L232780,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,That can't be.
33263,L232779,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!"
33264,L232777,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,Same old story.
33265,L232776,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food."
33266,L232773,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
33267,L232772,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,While they're strung out?
33268,L232771,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
33269,L232590,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I?  You all know my history.
33270,L232589,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Well, George, who were you?"
33271,L232586,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?"
33272,L232585,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?"
33273,L232584,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table..."
33274,L232550,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!"
33275,L232549,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I hope I never have to believe that.
33276,L232548,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'."
33277,L232547,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all."
33278,L232546,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,The army can survive without me.
33279,L232545,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,The army needs you.
33280,L232542,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict."
33281,L232541,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want."
33282,L232538,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,It is.
33283,L232537,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Is that a fact.
33284,L232536,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
33285,L232535,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Go on... I want to hear everything.
33286,L232531,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
33287,L232530,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate."
33288,L232529,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?"
33289,L232528,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did."
33290,L232527,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days."
33291,L232526,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!"
33292,L232525,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it..."
33293,L232524,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada."
33294,L232520,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
33295,L232519,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Arnold!
33296,L232273,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation."
33297,L232272,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?"
33298,L232271,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,And a French alliance?
33299,L232270,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies."
33300,L232269,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?"
33301,L232268,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,What's your frank estimation of the British?
33302,L232267,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!"
33303,L232266,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,You seem pleased by the prospect.
33304,L232265,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,Over three hundred miles.
33305,L232264,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
33306,L232263,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,"I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring."
33307,L232260,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga..."
33308,L232259,u1050,m69,ARNOLD,We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
33309,L232958,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,"Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free."
33310,L232957,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Well, what have you thought?"
33311,L232956,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,I ain't forgot about the freedom.
33312,L232955,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth..."
33313,L232850,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want..."
33314,L232849,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,No.  I guess.
33315,L232848,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?"
33316,L232847,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,"Yes, general."
33317,L232846,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought."
33318,L232845,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,"Yes, general?"
33319,L232844,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Wil...
33320,L232714,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Yes, William.  I am apologizing."
33321,L232713,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,Me?  You apologizing to me?
33322,L232711,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,That you would have known you can trust me.
33323,L232710,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,What?  What are you talking about?
33324,L232709,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,A lot of years have gone by.
33325,L232708,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Misunderstood what!?
33326,L232707,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,"Well... I misunderstood, then."
33327,L232706,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
33328,L232705,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,"Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't."
33329,L232704,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?"
33330,L232703,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,"You, you just need a new flint, General."
33331,L232232,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
33332,L232231,u1051,m69,BILLY LEE,"Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?"
33333,L232671,u1060,m69,MAWHOOD,"I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord..."
33334,L232670,u1052,m69,CORNWALLIS,"By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?"
33335,L232669,u1060,m69,MAWHOOD,"Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord."
33336,L232668,u1052,m69,CORNWALLIS,"Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?"
33337,L232667,u1060,m69,MAWHOOD,"Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord."
33338,L232666,u1052,m69,CORNWALLIS,"And, is that a pitchfork beside him?"
33339,L232665,u1060,m69,MAWHOOD,"Yes, my lord."
33340,L232664,u1052,m69,CORNWALLIS,"What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?"
33341,L232663,u1060,m69,MAWHOOD,"No, my lord."
33342,L232662,u1052,m69,CORNWALLIS,"No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?"
33343,L232826,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left..."
33344,L232825,u1053,m69,GENERAL LEE,That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
33345,L232824,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Who is that!?
33346,L232821,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!"
33347,L232820,u1053,m69,GENERAL LEE,The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
33348,L232819,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
33349,L232802,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Lafayette will not be happy...
33350,L232801,u1053,m69,GENERAL LEE,I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
33351,L232800,u1053,m69,GENERAL LEE,"More than that, sir... my orders from Congress."
33352,L232799,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us."
33353,L232968,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?"
33354,L232967,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?"
33355,L232964,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"But it's more than just that, am I right?"
33356,L232963,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them."
33357,L232962,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I'm not sure.
33358,L232961,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
33359,L232936,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then."
33360,L232935,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"Yes, I believe so."
33361,L232934,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?"
33362,L232933,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!"
33363,L232932,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"What's your advice, Alexander?"
33364,L232931,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?"
33365,L232930,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us."
33366,L232929,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,To hell with Arnold...
33367,L232928,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?"
33368,L232926,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,No one knows...
33369,L232925,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
33370,L232924,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
33371,L232923,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,What is this?
33372,L232909,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!"
33373,L232908,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
33374,L232907,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"Sir, Arnold is a traitor."
33375,L232906,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold..."
33376,L232905,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"Sir, I think no such thing."
33377,L232903,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
33378,L232902,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,Yessir.
33379,L232901,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold."
33380,L232900,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
33381,L232807,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
33382,L232806,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,What are we going to do?
33383,L232756,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us."
33384,L232755,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating."
33385,L232746,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"We better, Congress invented him."
33386,L232745,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"Are you going to keep him, sir?"
33387,L232588,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,To learn to shoot cannon?
33388,L232587,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College."
33389,L232577,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
33390,L232576,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers."
33391,L232400,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  ""I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."""
33392,L232399,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
33393,L232398,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
33394,L232397,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on."
33395,L232396,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
33396,L232395,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?"
33397,L232383,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear."
33398,L232382,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I'm so inclined.
33399,L232381,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"Therefore, retreat."
33400,L232380,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact."
33401,L232379,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?"
33402,L232366,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"Delighted, sir."
33403,L232365,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath."
33404,L232364,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"I'll be twenty next year, sir."
33405,L232363,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"How old are you, Captain?"
33406,L232176,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Then use rocks!
33407,L232175,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,We've got powder but no ball!
33408,L232174,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross."
33409,L232173,u1054,m69,HAMILTON,"Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!"
33410,L232194,u1055,m69,HORATIO GATES,"George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army."
33411,L232193,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
33412,L232192,u1055,m69,HORATIO GATES,Who's in command out there?
33413,L232191,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it."
33414,L232190,u1055,m69,HORATIO GATES,"Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?"
33415,L232189,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation."
33416,L232888,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
33417,L232887,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,They are... friends of Congress.
33418,L232886,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?"
33419,L232885,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,"George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold..."
33420,L232868,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down."
33421,L232867,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,Lafayette is a child!
33422,L232866,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
33423,L232223,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
33424,L232222,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
33425,L232215,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men..."
33426,L232214,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,"You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment."
33427,L232196,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient."
33428,L232195,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,"With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts."
33429,L232188,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,"Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds."
33430,L232187,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift."
33431,L232890,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,"It's the political 'cost of doing business', George."
33432,L232889,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,Partially...
33433,L232646,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,"Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?"
33434,L232645,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,"Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!"
33435,L232644,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,"No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington."
33436,L232641,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
33437,L232640,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,You think that?
33438,L232638,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,"You invented this, this..."
33439,L232637,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,"Oh, come now..."
33440,L232636,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,"Gag on your own invention, then."
33441,L232635,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,Makes you gag.
33442,L232634,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,"I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  ""General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!""  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!"
33443,L232633,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,Let's not over do it...
33444,L232235,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,"Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!"
33445,L232234,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,"He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him."
33446,L232233,u1056,m69,JOHN ADAMS,"Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!"
33447,L232345,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,What's the difference?
33448,L232344,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"Unofficially, General Greene."
33449,L232343,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,We already have black soldiers in our army...
33450,L232342,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
33451,L232339,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee."
33452,L232338,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"The British army, sir!"
33453,L232337,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,Detained by what?
33454,L232336,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,General Lee is detained captain...
33455,L232335,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
33456,L232334,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress."
33457,L232333,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
33458,L232332,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
33459,L232331,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"If he isn't, then he's stupid."
33460,L232330,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
33461,L232883,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!"
33462,L232882,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!"
33463,L232881,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!"
33464,L232863,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,How can you say that?
33465,L232862,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,The man is a traitor!
33466,L232861,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold."
33467,L232611,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia..."
33468,L232610,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!"
33469,L232609,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,They help me understand why we fight.
33470,L232608,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"And, Hamilton?  Greene?"
33471,L232607,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!"
33472,L232606,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold..."
33473,L232605,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader..."
33474,L232604,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
33475,L232572,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?"
33476,L232571,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that."
33477,L232570,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians..."
33478,L232562,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
33479,L232561,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
33480,L232560,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?"
33481,L232559,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,A grand scheme?
33482,L232557,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man."
33483,L232556,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army."
33484,L232555,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable."
33485,L232554,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,George!  So good to be back!
33486,L232553,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Colonel Reed...
33487,L232349,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,"I understand, George."
33488,L232348,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them."
33489,L232329,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
33490,L232328,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
33491,L232325,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,A fleet?
33492,L232324,u1057,m69,JOSEPH REED,Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
33493,L232323,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Any word from Canada?
33494,L232914,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York."
33495,L232913,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"I feel the same, sir."
33496,L232817,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Get these men back in line!
33497,L232816,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"General Lee, sir!"
33498,L232815,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
33499,L232791,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
33500,L232790,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"What is it, Marquis?"
33501,L232758,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers."
33502,L232757,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,Like flowers after the snow melts.
33503,L232752,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court."
33504,L232751,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad."
33505,L232744,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
33506,L232743,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"I rode here, on my horse."
33507,L232742,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse."
33508,L232741,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!"
33509,L232740,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,And how rusty are these muskets?
33510,L232739,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
33511,L232738,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,These supplies...?
33512,L232737,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,I only meant...
33513,L232736,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur."
33514,L232735,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies..."
33515,L232734,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,You must be very rich.
33516,L232733,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary."
33517,L232732,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"No, please; an advance on your salary."
33518,L232731,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
33519,L232730,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,I... they look both the same.
33520,L232729,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?"
33521,L232723,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"Uh... none just now, but..."
33522,L232722,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?"
33523,L232720,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
33524,L232719,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette..."
33525,L232718,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere."
33526,L232717,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
33527,L232716,u1058,m69,LAFAYETTE,"However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!"
33528,L232700,u1059,m69,MARTHA,I don't want to see your hospital.
33529,L232699,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I want you to see our hospital.
33530,L232698,u1059,m69,MARTHA,Not today.
33531,L232697,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
33532,L232696,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"Leave me, now sir, I am tired."
33533,L232695,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Martha!  For God's sake!
33534,L232694,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them."
33535,L232693,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too!
33536,L232692,u1059,m69,MARTHA,Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
33537,L232691,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
33538,L232690,u1059,m69,MARTHA,Some things must never change.
33539,L232689,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
33540,L232688,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?"
33541,L232687,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,To win this war I need an army.
33542,L232686,u1059,m69,MARTHA,Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
33543,L232685,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Martha... what?
33544,L232684,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now."
33545,L232683,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,What else?  From Virginia?
33546,L232682,u1059,m69,MARTHA,It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
33547,L232681,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I think I heard that.
33548,L232680,u1059,m69,MARTHA,Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
33549,L232304,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us."
33550,L232303,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,That's right...
33551,L232302,u1059,m69,MARTHA,That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
33552,L232301,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then..."
33553,L232300,u1059,m69,MARTHA,When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
33554,L232299,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"""Liberty, Virtue, Country""... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days..."
33555,L232298,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"You're no fool, George.  You never have been."
33556,L232297,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me."
33557,L232294,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Everything.  If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family.  We already have more slaves than we need, but we need more land."
33558,L232293,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?"
33559,L232292,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize."
33560,L232291,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory."
33561,L232290,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen."
33562,L232289,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed..."
33563,L232288,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I'm very aware of that.
33564,L232287,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as..."
33565,L232286,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation."
33566,L232285,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"My God, what?"
33567,L232284,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else..."
33568,L232283,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise."
33569,L232282,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend."
33570,L232281,u1059,m69,MARTHA,War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
33571,L232280,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Surely you knew this was coming.
33572,L232279,u1059,m69,MARTHA,"My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it."
33573,L232278,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
33574,L232966,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government."
33575,L232965,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country."
33576,L232960,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,It is; we need you George.
33577,L232959,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Well, this must be about something!"
33578,L232917,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"Yes sir, it's a wise idea..."
33579,L232916,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?"
33580,L232915,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform..."
33581,L232912,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you."
33582,L232911,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him."
33583,L232828,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!"
33584,L232827,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,What the hell are we doing?
33585,L232597,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again..."
33586,L232596,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,At one time I could have chosen not to be.
33587,L232595,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
33588,L232594,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"I will not betray you, Nathanael."
33589,L232593,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope."
33590,L232592,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
33591,L232591,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army."
33592,L232544,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton."
33593,L232543,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature."
33594,L232378,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael."
33595,L232377,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,I'm with Captain Hamilton.
33596,L232376,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,General Greene?
33597,L232362,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer."
33598,L232361,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman."
33599,L232360,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet."
33600,L232359,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs."
33601,L232358,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?"
33602,L232357,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
33603,L232212,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army."
33604,L232211,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,A horseshoer?
33605,L232210,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
33606,L232209,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"But, you do come from a military family?"
33607,L232208,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway..."
33608,L232207,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?"
33609,L232206,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir."
33610,L232205,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Yes, yes, happy to meet you."
33611,L232204,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,"Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia."
33612,L232180,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,Yessir!
33613,L232179,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!"
33614,L232178,u1061,m69,NATHANAEL GREENE,We're leaving them?
33615,L232177,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,We can't take them.  Are you all right?
33616,L232518,u1062,m69,SALLY,"""Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."""
33617,L232517,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Really?  Which precious homily was it?
33618,L232516,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all."
33619,L232515,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world."
33620,L232514,u1062,m69,SALLY,"You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?"
33621,L232513,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I'd throw everything away for you.
33622,L232512,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!"
33623,L232511,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am."
33624,L232510,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you."
33625,L232509,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,That's a lie!
33626,L232508,u1062,m69,SALLY,"And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?"
33627,L232507,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,But not more than your comfort.
33628,L232506,u1062,m69,SALLY,"George, you know I only love you, but..."
33629,L232505,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer."
33630,L232504,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,You know very well who it is that I love.
33631,L232503,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself."
33632,L232491,u1065,m69,WILLIAM,"Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?"
33633,L232490,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world."
33634,L232422,u1065,m69,WILLIAM,"Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?"
33635,L232421,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Except for that, quite like home; England, that is."
33636,L232420,u1065,m69,WILLIAM,"We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild."
33637,L232409,u1065,m69,WILLIAM,"That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!"
33638,L232408,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you."
33639,L232407,u1065,m69,WILLIAM,"George, I'm sorry."
33640,L232406,u1062,m69,SALLY,"So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated."
33641,L232496,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Voltaire, of course..."
33642,L232495,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,That's good... who?
33643,L232494,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Remember, George, ""It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."""
33644,L232479,u1062,m69,SALLY,And dost thou live to ask it?
33645,L232478,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,"I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?"
33646,L232477,u1062,m69,SALLY,"I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee."
33647,L232475,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!"
33648,L232474,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,They can use their imaginations.
33649,L232473,u1062,m69,SALLY,Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
33650,L232472,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,You're out of your mind!
33651,L232471,u1062,m69,SALLY,Let's get you darker!
33652,L232470,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,What are you doing?
33653,L232467,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,I think I will disappoint you.
33654,L232466,u1062,m69,SALLY,"I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings."
33655,L232465,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
33656,L232464,u1062,m69,SALLY,And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
33657,L232463,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,"Well, we must be who we must be..."
33658,L232462,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom."
33659,L232461,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,It's the freest land on earth.
33660,L232460,u1062,m69,SALLY,Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
33661,L232459,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,I think America suits you.
33662,L232458,u1062,m69,SALLY,The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
33663,L232457,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,"I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth."
33664,L232452,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid."
33665,L232451,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,Then why are you teaching me...?
33666,L232450,u1062,m69,SALLY,"It's stupid, of course."
33667,L232449,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,"What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?"
33668,L232446,u1062,m69,SALLY,That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
33669,L232445,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
33670,L232444,u1062,m69,SALLY,"In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes..."
33671,L232443,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,"Or, 'civilized'."
33672,L232442,u1062,m69,SALLY,"The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'."
33673,L232439,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,"Sally, our slave system is a British law..."
33674,L232438,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious."
33675,L232437,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,Slavers capture them and bring them here.
33676,L232436,u1062,m69,SALLY,Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
33677,L232435,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,"Africa, of course."
33678,L232434,u1062,m69,SALLY,"Where... do those men come from, George?"
33679,L232870,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!"
33680,L232869,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,"Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?"
33681,L232257,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,"Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them."
33682,L232256,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs."
33683,L232255,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,You hear that?
33684,L232250,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,"Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature."
33685,L232249,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,"And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot..."
33686,L232248,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,I see...
33687,L232247,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,I say!
33688,L232246,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Who says so?
33689,L232245,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,Yes!
33690,L232244,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,Just because they are born?
33691,L232243,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,All people have rights!
33692,L232242,u1064,m69,WASHINGTON,That land belongs to the strongest.
33693,L232241,u1063,m69,SAM ADAMS,You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
33694,L232493,u1065,m69,WILLIAM,"Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom."
33695,L232492,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,"William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff."
33696,L232487,u1065,m69,WILLIAM,He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
33697,L232486,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,Juba was a Numidian.
33698,L232485,u1065,m69,WILLIAM,"For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating."
33699,L232481,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,"This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now."
33700,L232480,u1065,m69,WILLIAM,"My daughter, I ask only..."
33701,L232417,u1066,m69,YOUNG WASHINGTON,"Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season."
33702,L232416,u1065,m69,WILLIAM,The land here is best for grain and corn.
33703,L233088,u1067,m70,ATTENDANT,"Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles."
33704,L233087,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You're kidding me, right?"
33705,L233086,u1067,m70,ATTENDANT,"Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans."
33706,L233085,u1071,m70,CHILI,I reserved a Cadillac.
33707,L233084,u1067,m70,ATTENDANT,An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
33708,L233083,u1071,m70,CHILI,What is this?
33709,L234095,u1068,m70,BEAR,You're right.
33710,L234094,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him."
33711,L234091,u1068,m70,BEAR,We'll get it later.
33712,L234090,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something."
33713,L234089,u1068,m70,BEAR,And that's for the airport.
33714,L234066,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons."
33715,L234065,u1068,m70,BEAR,"Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?"
33716,L234064,u1068,m70,BEAR,Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
33717,L234063,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Calm down, Bear..."
33718,L234062,u1068,m70,BEAR,You get life for kidnapping.
33719,L234055,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
33720,L234054,u1068,m70,BEAR,Trade for what?
33721,L234050,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Plan B. Here ya go, honey..."
33722,L234049,u1068,m70,BEAR,No. What's this?
33723,L234048,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,You get the money?
33724,L233969,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
33725,L233968,u1068,m70,BEAR,And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
33726,L233967,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
33727,L233966,u1068,m70,BEAR,What about him?
33728,L233965,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
33729,L233964,u1068,m70,BEAR,"After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other."
33730,L233963,u1068,m70,BEAR,Farrah. Come here.
33731,L233962,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
33732,L233961,u1068,m70,BEAR,"Come here, Farrah..."
33733,L233960,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat."
33734,L233957,u1068,m70,BEAR,That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
33735,L233956,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew."
33736,L233955,u1068,m70,BEAR,"Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done."
33737,L233954,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
33738,L233953,u1068,m70,BEAR,"Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding."
33739,L233952,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Who?
33740,L233951,u1068,m70,BEAR,I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
33741,L233950,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room."
33742,L233949,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him."
33743,L233948,u1068,m70,BEAR,"His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie..."
33744,L233947,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot."
33745,L233946,u1068,m70,BEAR,You see the paper?
33746,L233838,u1068,m70,BEAR,I mean I don't care.
33747,L233837,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,You guess? You mean you don't know?
33748,L233836,u1068,m70,BEAR,I guess still in the locker.
33749,L233835,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,So where's the money?
33750,L233834,u1068,m70,BEAR,He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
33751,L233572,u1068,m70,BEAR,They all sound big at the talking stage.
33752,L233571,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big."
33753,L233570,u1068,m70,BEAR,"Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo."
33754,L233569,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer."
33755,L233567,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies."
33756,L233566,u1068,m70,BEAR,"Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard."
33757,L233564,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,You see that? The way the man just went right over?
33758,L233563,u1068,m70,BEAR,"You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some."
33759,L233562,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him."
33760,L233826,u1071,m70,CHILI,No shit? What're some of 'em?
33761,L233825,u1068,m70,BEAR,About sixty.
33762,L233824,u1071,m70,CHILI,So... how many movies you been in?
33763,L233823,u1068,m70,BEAR,I think I pulled my quadriceps.
33764,L233822,u1071,m70,CHILI,How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
33765,L233821,u1068,m70,BEAR,Not too bad.
33766,L233820,u1071,m70,CHILI,"What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?"
33767,L233815,u1068,m70,BEAR,"I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace."
33768,L233814,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car."
33769,L233813,u1071,m70,CHILI,You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
33770,L233812,u1068,m70,BEAR,Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
33771,L233811,u1071,m70,CHILI,"What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?"
33772,L233810,u1068,m70,BEAR,I have to ask you for that key.
33773,L233809,u1071,m70,CHILI,"What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?"
33774,L233808,u1068,m70,BEAR,"You spotted them, huh?"
33775,L233807,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?"
33776,L233806,u1068,m70,BEAR,So you didn't have the key with you.
33777,L233805,u1071,m70,CHILI,I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
33778,L233858,u1076,m70,ESCOBAR,"I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money."
33779,L233857,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar."
33780,L233856,u1076,m70,ESCOBAR,I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
33781,L233855,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,He's around someplace.
33782,L233854,u1076,m70,ESCOBAR,"Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?"
33783,L233853,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Maybe your nephew panicked, took off."
33784,L233852,u1076,m70,ESCOBAR,"A zillion, huh? That's a lot."
33785,L233851,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
33786,L233850,u1076,m70,ESCOBAR,Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
33787,L233849,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
33788,L233848,u1076,m70,ESCOBAR,You gave him the money?
33789,L233847,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way."
33790,L233846,u1076,m70,ESCOBAR,"He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money."
33791,L233845,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
33792,L233844,u1076,m70,ESCOBAR,"He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?"
33793,L233843,u1076,m70,ESCOBAR,Yayo. Where is he?
33794,L233842,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Your who?
33795,L233841,u1076,m70,ESCOBAR,Where is my nephew?
33796,L234082,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Bear, you're not really gonna -"
33797,L234081,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Man, I can't wait for you to be dead."
33798,L234080,u1071,m70,CHILI,"It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne."
33799,L234079,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado."
33800,L234078,u1071,m70,CHILI,What?
33801,L234077,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
33802,L234074,u1071,m70,CHILI,First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
33803,L234073,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,She's great. Gimme the money.
33804,L234069,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,In the can. That the money?
33805,L234068,u1071,m70,CHILI,Where's Karen?
33806,L234047,u1071,m70,CHILI,Gimme an hour.
33807,L234046,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
33808,L234045,u1071,m70,CHILI,I'll find it.
33809,L234044,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,You know Laurel Canyon?
33810,L234043,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping."
33811,L234042,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it."
33812,L234041,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies."
33813,L234040,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,She can't talk right now.
33814,L234039,u1071,m70,CHILI,Karen? You okay?
33815,L234038,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Three.
33816,L234037,u1071,m70,CHILI,I don't believe this.
33817,L234036,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,In just a second. Two...
33818,L234035,u1071,m70,CHILI,"What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?"
33819,L234034,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One..."
33820,L234033,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Tell you what...
33821,L234032,u1071,m70,CHILI,I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
33822,L234030,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?"
33823,L234029,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
33824,L234028,u1071,m70,CHILI,What money?
33825,L234027,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,I need the money.
33826,L233498,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know."
33827,L233497,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,I really think I can be of service on this one.
33828,L233495,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,That's all.
33829,L233494,u1071,m70,CHILI,"That's all there is to it, huh?"
33830,L233493,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done."
33831,L233492,u1071,m70,CHILI,You know how to write one of these?
33832,L233490,u1071,m70,CHILI,"She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good."
33833,L233489,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Who?
33834,L233488,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores."
33835,L233487,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?"
33836,L233486,u1071,m70,CHILI,She's... young.
33837,L233485,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
33838,L233484,u1071,m70,CHILI,Get something going there.
33839,L233483,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,What about her?
33840,L233482,u1071,m70,CHILI,There's Ilona.
33841,L233481,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
33842,L233480,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than ""Lovejoy""."
33843,L233479,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?"
33844,L233478,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy."
33845,L233477,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?"
33846,L233476,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie ""Fingers""."
33847,L233475,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep."
33848,L233474,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that."
33849,L233473,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?"
33850,L233472,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, we're getting Martin."
33851,L233471,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
33852,L233470,u1071,m70,CHILI,"That's right, me."
33853,L233469,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,You must bring something heavy to the deal.
33854,L233468,u1071,m70,CHILI,"It's what he said, I'm his associate."
33855,L233467,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace."
33856,L233466,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit."
33857,L233465,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has."
33858,L233464,u1071,m70,CHILI,"That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you."
33859,L233463,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him."
33860,L233323,u1071,m70,CHILI,That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
33861,L233322,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,You can talk to me.
33862,L233321,u1071,m70,CHILI,"But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?"
33863,L233320,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Harry, let me answer that."
33864,L233319,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,What's this movie you're doing first?
33865,L233694,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,That's the magic number.
33866,L233693,u1077,m70,HARRY,C-18.
33867,L233691,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,It's not the kind of thing you do.
33868,L233690,u1077,m70,HARRY,I don't know.
33869,L233689,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about."
33870,L233688,u1077,m70,HARRY,The airport.
33871,L233687,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up."
33872,L233686,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?"
33873,L233684,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Leo, I don't know."
33874,L233683,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?"
33875,L233671,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer."
33876,L233670,u1077,m70,HARRY,You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
33877,L233669,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
33878,L233668,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
33879,L233667,u1077,m70,HARRY,You serious?
33880,L233666,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest."
33881,L233655,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that."
33882,L233654,u1077,m70,HARRY,Chili Palmer showed you my script?
33883,L233653,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
33884,L233651,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?"
33885,L233650,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy."
33886,L233649,u1077,m70,HARRY,I'm working on a few things.
33887,L233648,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?"
33888,L233647,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -"
33889,L233330,u1077,m70,HARRY,It's a different kind of deal.
33890,L233329,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,You positive about that?
33891,L233328,u1077,m70,HARRY,I can't do it.
33892,L233327,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of ""Freaks"" and put 'em in this other one, ""Mr. Loverboy""."
33893,L233863,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
33894,L233862,u1083,m70,RONNIE,"I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie."
33895,L233861,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account."
33896,L233332,u1083,m70,RONNIE,"By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco."
33897,L233331,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,"Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one."
33898,L233306,u1083,m70,RONNIE,"Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately."
33899,L233305,u1069,m70,BO CATLETT,What I been wondering is where's he been.
33900,L233304,u1083,m70,RONNIE,"I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?"
33901,L233870,u1077,m70,HARRY,That's correct. Look at me.
33902,L233869,u1070,m70,BONES,You say look at you?
33903,L233868,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Look at me, Ray."
33904,L233867,u1070,m70,BONES,What?
33905,L233866,u1077,m70,HARRY,Ray. Look at me.
33906,L233865,u1070,m70,BONES,Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
33907,L233758,u1077,m70,HARRY,Or else use your fucking imagination.
33908,L233757,u1070,m70,BONES,Or else what?
33909,L233756,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else."
33910,L233755,u1070,m70,BONES,"So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?"
33911,L233754,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm."
33912,L233753,u1070,m70,BONES,Never heard of him.
33913,L233752,u1077,m70,HARRY,Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
33914,L233751,u1070,m70,BONES,Who?
33915,L233750,u1077,m70,HARRY,"I work for Harry Zimm, alright?"
33916,L233749,u1070,m70,BONES,Okay. So who are you?
33917,L233748,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real."
33918,L233747,u1070,m70,BONES,"Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real."
33919,L233746,u1077,m70,HARRY,Hello? You there?
33920,L233745,u1077,m70,HARRY,The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
33921,L233744,u1070,m70,BONES,What three hundred grand?
33922,L233743,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?"
33923,L233742,u1070,m70,BONES,Depends. Who's this?
33924,L233741,u1077,m70,HARRY,Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
33925,L233740,u1070,m70,BONES,Who is this?
33926,L233739,u1077,m70,HARRY,Ray Barboni?
33927,L234131,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Whatever you want, Ray."
33928,L234130,u1070,m70,BONES,"Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before - I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?"
33929,L234129,u1071,m70,CHILI,I like it here.
33930,L234128,u1070,m70,BONES,"You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?"
33931,L234127,u1071,m70,CHILI,Sovereign.
33932,L234126,u1070,m70,BONES,Yeah? Which terminal?
33933,L234125,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I checked the bag at the airport, when I came."
33934,L234119,u1070,m70,BONES,"'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me."
33935,L234118,u1071,m70,CHILI,Why would I do that?
33936,L234115,u1070,m70,BONES,Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
33937,L234114,u1071,m70,CHILI,"So what brings you to L.A., Bones?"
33938,L234113,u1070,m70,BONES,I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
33939,L234112,u1071,m70,CHILI,How'd you get in here?
33940,L233892,u1083,m70,RONNIE,"Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time."
33941,L233891,u1070,m70,BONES,"You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that."
33942,L233889,u1070,m70,BONES,"Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city."
33943,L233888,u1083,m70,RONNIE,"Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me."
33944,L233887,u1070,m70,BONES,I don't like waiting.
33945,L233886,u1083,m70,RONNIE,"Get in line, bro."
33946,L233885,u1070,m70,BONES,He owes me money.
33947,L233884,u1083,m70,RONNIE,The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
33948,L233883,u1083,m70,RONNIE,"What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?"
33949,L233882,u1070,m70,BONES,Ray Barboni. From Miami.
33950,L233881,u1083,m70,RONNIE,Who the fuck are you?
33951,L233800,u1072,m70,CURTIS,Get him out've here.
33952,L233799,u1071,m70,CHILI,That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
33953,L233798,u1072,m70,CURTIS,That's the idea. I'll think about it.
33954,L233797,u1071,m70,CHILI,Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
33955,L233796,u1072,m70,CURTIS,Something shouldn't be there.
33956,L233795,u1071,m70,CHILI,"It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?"
33957,L233794,u1072,m70,CURTIS,"By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?"
33958,L233792,u1071,m70,CHILI,I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
33959,L233791,u1072,m70,CURTIS,Your wife a Lakers fan?
33960,L233780,u1071,m70,CHILI,Not yet. I just started.
33961,L233779,u1072,m70,CURTIS,You have a card in here?
33962,L233778,u1071,m70,CHILI,I'm a producer.
33963,L233777,u1072,m70,CURTIS,"You're an investor, is that it?"
33964,L233776,u1071,m70,CHILI,I'm in the movie business.
33965,L233775,u1072,m70,CURTIS,What're you doing in Los Angeles?
33966,L233774,u1071,m70,CHILI,That's right.
33967,L233773,u1072,m70,CURTIS,You live in Miami?
33968,L233082,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Movie producer? Yeah, why not."
33969,L233081,u1073,m70,DICK,"Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer."
33970,L233080,u1071,m70,CHILI,What've you got?
33971,L233079,u1073,m70,DICK,"Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway."
33972,L233078,u1073,m70,DICK,"Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now."
33973,L233077,u1071,m70,CHILI,Leo spanked a waitress?
33974,L233076,u1073,m70,DICK,"Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room."
33975,L233732,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key."
33976,L233731,u1077,m70,HARRY,Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
33977,L233729,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money..."
33978,L233728,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names..."
33979,L233727,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died."
33980,L233726,u1077,m70,HARRY,Who?
33981,L233725,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble."
33982,L233724,u1077,m70,HARRY,You have it?
33983,L233723,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Forget about Leo's money, Harry."
33984,L233722,u1071,m70,CHILI,I found him.
33985,L233721,u1077,m70,HARRY,"So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him."
33986,L233718,u1077,m70,HARRY,A meeting with who? You and Karen?
33987,L233717,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting."
33988,L233716,u1077,m70,HARRY,Really.
33989,L233712,u1077,m70,HARRY,"I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies."
33990,L233711,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up."
33991,L233707,u1077,m70,HARRY,Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
33992,L233706,u1071,m70,CHILI,Is he giving you a check or cash?
33993,L233461,u1077,m70,HARRY,Get the fuck outta my chair.
33994,L233460,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Here's your keys, Harry."
33995,L233433,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!"
33996,L233432,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Hey, Harry."
33997,L233431,u1077,m70,HARRY,How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
33998,L233342,u1077,m70,HARRY,His shrink's trainer.
33999,L233341,u1071,m70,CHILI,"That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink."
34000,L233340,u1077,m70,HARRY,"I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing."
34001,L233339,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears."
34002,L233338,u1071,m70,CHILI,Never say anything unless you have to.
34003,L233337,u1077,m70,HARRY,I had to tell 'em something.
34004,L233336,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut."
34005,L233335,u1077,m70,HARRY,What?
34006,L233296,u1077,m70,HARRY,"You're kidding, right?"
34007,L233295,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'"
34008,L233292,u1071,m70,CHILI,"That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am."
34009,L233291,u1077,m70,HARRY,They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
34010,L233290,u1071,m70,CHILI,"No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down."
34011,L233286,u1077,m70,HARRY,Read it. It's a grabber.
34012,L233285,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?"
34013,L233266,u1071,m70,CHILI,Let's see how we get along.
34014,L233265,u1077,m70,HARRY,What do you get out of this?
34015,L233264,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do."
34016,L233263,u1077,m70,HARRY,You don't even know these guys.
34017,L233262,u1071,m70,CHILI,But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
34018,L233261,u1077,m70,HARRY,Just a thought.
34019,L233260,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I'm not gonna pop her, Harry."
34020,L233259,u1077,m70,HARRY,"That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -"
34021,L233258,u1071,m70,CHILI,So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
34022,L233257,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script."
34023,L233256,u1077,m70,HARRY,Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
34024,L233255,u1071,m70,CHILI,He drown?
34025,L233254,u1077,m70,HARRY,The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
34026,L233253,u1071,m70,CHILI,So what's the problem?
34027,L233252,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it."
34028,L233251,u1077,m70,HARRY,"She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades."
34029,L233250,u1071,m70,CHILI,She looks familiar.
34030,L233249,u1077,m70,HARRY,"""Ride the Clouds"". Good picture."
34031,L233248,u1071,m70,CHILI,"No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney."
34032,L233247,u1077,m70,HARRY,One of his best parts.
34033,L233246,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in ""The Cyclone""."
34034,L233245,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir."
34035,L233244,u1071,m70,CHILI,Who's the star?
34036,L233243,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it."
34037,L233242,u1077,m70,HARRY,It's not bad when you know what it's about.
34038,L233241,u1071,m70,CHILI,"""Mr. Lovejoy""? That's the title?"
34039,L233240,u1077,m70,HARRY,"""Mr. Lovejoy""."
34040,L233239,u1071,m70,CHILI,What's it called?
34041,L233238,u1077,m70,HARRY,"A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my ""Driving Miss Daisy""."
34042,L233237,u1071,m70,CHILI,For a movie?
34043,L233236,u1077,m70,HARRY,Because I need half a million to buy a script.
34044,L233235,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?"
34045,L233234,u1077,m70,HARRY,Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
34046,L233233,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?"
34047,L233232,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Harry, look at me."
34048,L233231,u1077,m70,HARRY,"These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -"
34049,L233222,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?"
34050,L233221,u1071,m70,CHILI,I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
34051,L233220,u1077,m70,HARRY,Really? You ever been arrested?
34052,L233219,u1071,m70,CHILI,Once.
34053,L233218,u1077,m70,HARRY,Ever shot anybody.
34054,L233217,u1071,m70,CHILI,Maybe a few times I have.
34055,L233216,u1077,m70,HARRY,What does that mean?
34056,L233215,u1071,m70,CHILI,Not really.
34057,L233214,u1077,m70,HARRY,You pack a gun?
34058,L233213,u1071,m70,CHILI,They always paid.
34059,L233212,u1077,m70,HARRY,"I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying."
34060,L233204,u1071,m70,CHILI,What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
34061,L233203,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Is that right, that's what you do for a living?"
34062,L233200,u1077,m70,HARRY,So you don't work for the casino?
34063,L233199,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen."
34064,L233198,u1077,m70,HARRY,But you work for the casino?
34065,L233197,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I'm not the guy, Harry."
34066,L233196,u1077,m70,HARRY,You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
34067,L233195,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You mean, Leo?"
34068,L233194,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?"
34069,L233193,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Part of it, yeah."
34070,L233189,u1077,m70,HARRY,The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
34071,L233188,u1071,m70,CHILI,The shylock's the good guy.
34072,L233187,u1077,m70,HARRY,"That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy."
34073,L233186,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I said I had an idea, that's all."
34074,L233185,u1077,m70,HARRY,That's it? That's your movie?
34075,L233184,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens."
34076,L233183,u1077,m70,HARRY,So he comes to L.A...
34077,L233176,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list..."
34078,L233175,u1077,m70,HARRY,Keep going.
34079,L233167,u1071,m70,CHILI,That's right. As a matter of fact...
34080,L233166,u1077,m70,HARRY,Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
34081,L233158,u1071,m70,CHILI,Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
34082,L233157,u1077,m70,HARRY,"It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken."
34083,L233154,u1077,m70,HARRY,"I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops."
34084,L233153,u1071,m70,CHILI,You just did.
34085,L233152,u1077,m70,HARRY,"You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her."
34086,L233144,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?"
34087,L233143,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores."
34088,L233139,u1077,m70,HARRY,"I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen."
34089,L233138,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You make movies, huh?"
34090,L233135,u1077,m70,HARRY,Fuckin' basketball game.
34091,L233134,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position."
34092,L233133,u1077,m70,HARRY,"You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?"
34093,L233132,u1071,m70,CHILI,I want you to.
34094,L233131,u1077,m70,HARRY,Why do I have to keep looking at you?
34095,L233130,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You're not looking at me, Harry."
34096,L233129,u1071,m70,CHILI,"They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore..."
34097,L233128,u1077,m70,HARRY,I know what a marker is.
34098,L233127,u1071,m70,CHILI,"A marker's like a check, Harry."
34099,L233125,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Harry, lemme give you some advice."
34100,L233124,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?"
34101,L233120,u1071,m70,CHILI,"We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is."
34102,L233119,u1077,m70,HARRY,Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
34103,L233118,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?"
34104,L233117,u1077,m70,HARRY,That's what I'm doing.
34105,L233116,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I want you to keep looking right here, okay?"
34106,L233115,u1077,m70,HARRY,I'm looking at you.
34107,L233113,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to."
34108,L233112,u1077,m70,HARRY,Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
34109,L233110,u1071,m70,CHILI,We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
34110,L233109,u1077,m70,HARRY,Have we met? I don't recall.
34111,L233108,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Where you been, Harry?"
34112,L233107,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do."
34113,L233063,u1082,m70,RAY BONES,"Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it."
34114,L233062,u1071,m70,CHILI,Twenty seven hundred.
34115,L233061,u1082,m70,RAY BONES,"You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh..."
34116,L233057,u1071,m70,CHILI,Ask your man here.
34117,L233056,u1082,m70,RAY BONES,Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
34118,L233055,u1071,m70,CHILI,"'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'"
34119,L233054,u1082,m70,RAY BONES,"Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect."
34120,L233052,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway."
34121,L233051,u1082,m70,RAY BONES,"Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife."
34122,L233050,u1071,m70,CHILI,It was in the Herald.
34123,L233049,u1082,m70,RAY BONES,What Get Away jet?
34124,L233048,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month."
34125,L233047,u1082,m70,RAY BONES,Personally?
34126,L233046,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, he told me."
34127,L233045,u1082,m70,RAY BONES,"How'd you know he died, he tell you?"
34128,L233044,u1071,m70,CHILI,He died.
34129,L233043,u1082,m70,RAY BONES,You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
34130,L233038,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya."
34131,L233037,u1082,m70,RAY BONES,"You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?"
34132,L234012,u1071,m70,CHILI,That's not bad. I think you got it down.
34133,L234011,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"Whatta you think, Chill?"
34134,L233682,u1081,m70,MARTIN,Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
34135,L233681,u1071,m70,CHILI,Compass.
34136,L233680,u1081,m70,MARTIN,What's that?
34137,L233679,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans."
34138,L233678,u1081,m70,MARTIN,Very nice...
34139,L233673,u1071,m70,CHILI,Buddy?
34140,L233672,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting."
34141,L233662,u1081,m70,MARTIN,You're not going to tell me the rest?
34142,L233661,u1071,m70,CHILI,"At that point, basically, that has to be it."
34143,L233660,u1081,m70,MARTIN,Okay. I'm listening.
34144,L233659,u1071,m70,CHILI,"It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation."
34145,L233658,u1081,m70,MARTIN,So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
34146,L233657,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Good-looking, too.  Like Karen."
34147,L233656,u1081,m70,MARTIN,The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
34148,L233644,u1081,m70,MARTIN,How do I know that?
34149,L233643,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas."
34150,L233642,u1081,m70,MARTIN,I turn it on when I confront the guy.
34151,L233641,u1071,m70,CHILI,I believe it.
34152,L233640,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing."
34153,L233639,u1071,m70,CHILI,That's not bad.
34154,L233638,u1081,m70,MARTIN,How about this?
34155,L233636,u1071,m70,CHILI,Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
34156,L233635,u1081,m70,MARTIN,Wait. How about this?
34157,L233634,u1071,m70,CHILI,"What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?"
34158,L233633,u1081,m70,MARTIN,Like this?
34159,L233632,u1071,m70,CHILI,"No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it."
34160,L233631,u1081,m70,MARTIN,I'm looking at you.
34161,L233630,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Martin, look at me."
34162,L233629,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?"
34163,L233625,u1071,m70,CHILI,Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
34164,L233624,u1081,m70,MARTIN,What happened? The pressure got to you?
34165,L233623,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami."
34166,L233621,u1081,m70,MARTIN,With what? Wiseguy money?
34167,L233620,u1071,m70,CHILI,One we're producing.
34168,L233619,u1081,m70,MARTIN,One of mine?
34169,L233618,u1071,m70,CHILI,I'm thinking of a movie.
34170,L233617,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"If you'd like to tell me, yeah."
34171,L233616,u1071,m70,CHILI,So you want to know.
34172,L233615,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious."
34173,L233614,u1071,m70,CHILI,So you don't know what I'm thinking.
34174,L233611,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads."
34175,L233610,u1071,m70,CHILI,You mean like we don't give a shit.
34176,L233609,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views."
34177,L233608,u1071,m70,CHILI,We talk different?
34178,L233607,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech."
34179,L233606,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act."
34180,L233605,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play."
34181,L233604,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone."
34182,L233603,u1081,m70,MARTIN,Yeah. That was a good party.
34183,L233428,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I'll find you, Leo..."
34184,L233427,u1079,m70,LEO,But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
34185,L233426,u1071,m70,CHILI,"At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving."
34186,L233425,u1079,m70,LEO,"You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?"
34187,L233421,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Sit down, Leo."
34188,L233420,u1079,m70,LEO,It's all mine.
34189,L233419,u1071,m70,CHILI,You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
34190,L233418,u1079,m70,LEO,How? By taking my money?
34191,L233417,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass."
34192,L233416,u1079,m70,LEO,"It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?"
34193,L233415,u1071,m70,CHILI,Here's another tip...
34194,L233414,u1079,m70,LEO,How'd you know I was here?
34195,L233413,u1071,m70,CHILI,Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
34196,L233412,u1079,m70,LEO,Who told you that?
34197,L233411,u1071,m70,CHILI,From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
34198,L233410,u1079,m70,LEO,I'm up twelve grand today.
34199,L233409,u1071,m70,CHILI,You've been losing.
34200,L233408,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want."
34201,L233407,u1079,m70,LEO,They report it to the IRS.
34202,L233406,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?"
34203,L233405,u1079,m70,LEO,I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
34204,L233404,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are."
34205,L233008,u1071,m70,CHILI,I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
34206,L233007,u1080,m70,MANAGER,Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
34207,L233006,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?"
34208,L233005,u1080,m70,MANAGER,We call you a taxi.
34209,L232997,u1080,m70,MANAGER,Maybe you don't see my sign?
34210,L232996,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine."
34211,L232995,u1080,m70,MANAGER,It's not one of these?
34212,L234145,u1071,m70,CHILI,Couldn't find my toothbrush.
34213,L234144,u1078,m70,KAREN,What took you so long?
34214,L234110,u1078,m70,KAREN,Go get your stuff.
34215,L234109,u1071,m70,CHILI,I'll be right back.
34216,L234108,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?"
34217,L234107,u1078,m70,KAREN,You don't act like it?
34218,L234106,u1071,m70,CHILI,You bet.
34219,L234105,u1078,m70,KAREN,Were you scared up there?
34220,L234102,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry..."
34221,L234101,u1071,m70,CHILI,Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
34222,L234072,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake."
34223,L234071,u1071,m70,CHILI,You okay?
34224,L234024,u1071,m70,CHILI,I'll go. I'll go.
34225,L234023,u1078,m70,KAREN,You're as bad as Harry...
34226,L234022,u1071,m70,CHILI,I don't know.
34227,L234021,u1078,m70,KAREN,Are you going down?
34228,L234020,u1071,m70,CHILI,It's not Dave. It's a movie.
34229,L234019,u1078,m70,KAREN,"He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV."
34230,L234018,u1071,m70,CHILI,You sure?
34231,L233981,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies."
34232,L233980,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital."
34233,L233979,u1078,m70,KAREN,Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
34234,L233978,u1071,m70,CHILI,Why not?
34235,L233977,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu."
34236,L233976,u1071,m70,CHILI,What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
34237,L233931,u1071,m70,CHILI,What happened?
34238,L233930,u1078,m70,KAREN,Harry... My God...
34239,L233925,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Hey, Chili? Look at me."
34240,L233924,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -"
34241,L233923,u1078,m70,KAREN,Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
34242,L233922,u1071,m70,CHILI,You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
34243,L233921,u1071,m70,CHILI,Oh.
34244,L233920,u1078,m70,KAREN,No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
34245,L233919,u1071,m70,CHILI,You thought I was faking?
34246,L233918,u1078,m70,KAREN,"I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it."
34247,L233917,u1078,m70,KAREN,Really.
34248,L233916,u1071,m70,CHILI,Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
34249,L233915,u1078,m70,KAREN,Yeah?
34250,L233914,u1071,m70,CHILI,"That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it."
34251,L233913,u1078,m70,KAREN,How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
34252,L233912,u1071,m70,CHILI,How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
34253,L233911,u1078,m70,KAREN,So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
34254,L233910,u1078,m70,KAREN,"For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then."
34255,L233909,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty."
34256,L233908,u1078,m70,KAREN,"You don't like Martin much, do you?"
34257,L233907,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together."
34258,L233906,u1078,m70,KAREN,Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
34259,L233905,u1071,m70,CHILI,How'd you meet Martin anyway?
34260,L233904,u1078,m70,KAREN,Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
34261,L233903,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Depends, who pays?"
34262,L233902,u1078,m70,KAREN,"That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it."
34263,L233709,u1071,m70,CHILI,The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
34264,L233708,u1078,m70,KAREN,"A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid."
34265,L233664,u1071,m70,CHILI,Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
34266,L233663,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy."
34267,L233574,u1078,m70,KAREN,You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
34268,L233573,u1071,m70,CHILI,This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
34269,L233525,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time."
34270,L233524,u1078,m70,KAREN,And you think the movie business is any different?
34271,L233523,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny."
34272,L233522,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Yesterday, you were a loan shark."
34273,L233521,u1071,m70,CHILI,Why does anyone want to be in movies?
34274,L233520,u1078,m70,KAREN,I want to know.
34275,L233519,u1071,m70,CHILI,"That why you came over here, to ask me that?"
34276,L233518,u1078,m70,KAREN,What do you get out of it?
34277,L233517,u1071,m70,CHILI,Sounds fair.
34278,L233516,u1078,m70,KAREN,"I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin."
34279,L233515,u1071,m70,CHILI,There a part in it for you?
34280,L233514,u1078,m70,KAREN,You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
34281,L233513,u1071,m70,CHILI,Not yet.
34282,L233512,u1078,m70,KAREN,Then you've read it?
34283,L233511,u1071,m70,CHILI,I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
34284,L233510,u1078,m70,KAREN,I think it's not horrible.
34285,L233509,u1071,m70,CHILI,What do you think?
34286,L233508,u1078,m70,KAREN,I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
34287,L233507,u1071,m70,CHILI,I got you a copy of the script.
34288,L233505,u1078,m70,KAREN,I just caught the end.
34289,L233504,u1071,m70,CHILI,You been here the whole time?
34290,L233397,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah. Right.  Listen, ""Touch of Evil""'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?"
34291,L233396,u1078,m70,KAREN,Right. See how your story ends.
34292,L233395,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner."
34293,L233394,u1078,m70,KAREN,Don't go out of your way.
34294,L233393,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you."
34295,L233392,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out."
34296,L233391,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped."
34297,L233390,u1078,m70,KAREN,Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
34298,L233389,u1071,m70,CHILI,That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
34299,L233388,u1078,m70,KAREN,"He must mean after ""Slime Creature 3""."
34300,L233387,u1071,m70,CHILI,You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
34301,L233386,u1078,m70,KAREN,I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
34302,L233385,u1071,m70,CHILI,How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
34303,L233381,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'"
34304,L233380,u1071,m70,CHILI,"""Cotton""."
34305,L233379,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, ""Cabin in the..."""
34306,L233378,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Man, can you scream."
34307,L233377,u1078,m70,KAREN,"I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream."
34308,L233376,u1071,m70,CHILI,For any movie.
34309,L233375,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie."
34310,L233374,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in ""Mildred Pierce"" - which by the way was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look."
34311,L233373,u1078,m70,KAREN,You saw that one?
34312,L233372,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Like in ""Bride of the Mutant"", when you played the whole end with that torn top."
34313,L233371,u1078,m70,KAREN,...That's what we finally decided.
34314,L233370,u1071,m70,CHILI,Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
34315,L233369,u1078,m70,KAREN,I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
34316,L233368,u1071,m70,CHILI,Rough day on the set?
34317,L233367,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out."
34318,L233366,u1071,m70,CHILI,"No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here."
34319,L233365,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?"
34320,L233364,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night."
34321,L233363,u1078,m70,KAREN,What're you doing here?
34322,L233362,u1071,m70,CHILI,Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
34323,L233179,u1078,m70,KAREN,How much is the wife offered?
34324,L233178,u1071,m70,CHILI,"A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years."
34325,L233174,u1078,m70,KAREN,A real bargain.
34326,L233173,u1071,m70,CHILI,"A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad."
34327,L233172,u1078,m70,KAREN,But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
34328,L233171,u1071,m70,CHILI,That's right. Three percent.
34329,L233170,u1078,m70,KAREN,The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
34330,L233156,u1078,m70,KAREN,I know what a vig is.
34331,L233155,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay."
34332,L233151,u1078,m70,KAREN,What if it was?
34333,L233150,u1071,m70,CHILI,"No, it was open. It wasn't locked."
34334,L233149,u1078,m70,KAREN,You broke in?
34335,L233148,u1071,m70,CHILI,"The door from the patio, in back."
34336,L233360,u1084,m70,TOMMY,"Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit."
34337,L233359,u1071,m70,CHILI,"I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer."
34338,L233358,u1084,m70,TOMMY,How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
34339,L233357,u1071,m70,CHILI,I'm thinking about producing.
34340,L233356,u1084,m70,TOMMY,What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
34341,L233355,u1071,m70,CHILI,I'm going into the movie business.
34342,L233354,u1084,m70,TOMMY,Whatta you doing out there?
34343,L233353,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now."
34344,L233352,u1084,m70,TOMMY,He already knew it.
34345,L233351,u1071,m70,CHILI,How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
34346,L233350,u1084,m70,TOMMY,"All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't."
34347,L233349,u1071,m70,CHILI,"You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing."
34348,L233348,u1084,m70,TOMMY,"No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead."
34349,L233347,u1071,m70,CHILI,You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
34350,L233346,u1084,m70,TOMMY,"I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time."
34351,L233065,u1071,m70,CHILI,Don't say a fuckin' word.
34352,L233064,u1084,m70,TOMMY,I told you not to -
34353,L233035,u1084,m70,TOMMY,"In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down."
34354,L233034,u1071,m70,CHILI,That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
34355,L233033,u1084,m70,TOMMY,"No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe."
34356,L233014,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that."
34357,L233013,u1084,m70,TOMMY,"Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that."
34358,L233011,u1084,m70,TOMMY,"Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat."
34359,L233010,u1071,m70,CHILI,That's what the guy said.
34360,L233009,u1084,m70,TOMMY,You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
34361,L232982,u1084,m70,TOMMY,"What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job."
34362,L232981,u1071,m70,CHILI,"Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films."
34363,L232980,u1071,m70,CHILI,What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
34364,L232979,u1084,m70,TOMMY,"Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's."
34365,L232978,u1071,m70,CHILI,"They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?"
34366,L233458,u1077,m70,HARRY,"What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them."
34367,L233457,u1074,m70,DIRECTOR,"That's great, Harry. So what's the --"
34368,L233456,u1077,m70,HARRY,"So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'"
34369,L233453,u1077,m70,HARRY,"You heard me, Pick 'n' Save."
34370,L233452,u1074,m70,DIRECTOR,Hm?
34371,L233451,u1077,m70,HARRY,Pick 'n' Save.
34372,L233450,u1074,m70,DIRECTOR,"Yeah? What three words, Harry?"
34373,L233449,u1077,m70,HARRY,"She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking."
34374,L233448,u1074,m70,DIRECTOR,What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
34375,L233447,u1077,m70,HARRY,All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
34376,L233438,u1077,m70,HARRY,Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
34377,L233437,u1074,m70,DIRECTOR,"Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view."
34378,L233436,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Yeah, but whose point of view?"
34379,L233551,u1077,m70,HARRY,How honorable of you.
34380,L233550,u1075,m70,DORIS,"He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday."
34381,L233549,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Yeah, what'd he have to say?"
34382,L233548,u1075,m70,DORIS,"No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script."
34383,L233547,u1077,m70,HARRY,So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
34384,L233546,u1075,m70,DORIS,Murray's dead.
34385,L233545,u1077,m70,HARRY,I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
34386,L233544,u1075,m70,DORIS,You seem to feel fine about it.
34387,L233543,u1077,m70,HARRY,"I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris."
34388,L233539,u1075,m70,DORIS,"What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late."
34389,L233538,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was."
34390,L233537,u1075,m70,DORIS,"I miss Murray, Harry."
34391,L233536,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?"
34392,L233535,u1075,m70,DORIS,What a spectacular view.
34393,L233534,u1077,m70,HARRY,Come on in.
34394,L233533,u1075,m70,DORIS,"Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?"
34395,L233532,u1075,m70,DORIS,Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
34396,L233531,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Hello, Doris."
34397,L233720,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick."
34398,L233719,u1078,m70,KAREN,Harry -
34399,L233715,u1078,m70,KAREN,Chili and me.
34400,L233714,u1077,m70,HARRY,'We?'
34401,L233713,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Harry, we spoke with Martin."
34402,L233705,u1077,m70,HARRY,"He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want."
34403,L233704,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?"
34404,L233210,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Oh, yeah, sure."
34405,L233209,u1078,m70,KAREN,"What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house."
34406,L233208,u1077,m70,HARRY,No problem. You go on off to bed.
34407,L233207,u1078,m70,KAREN,Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
34408,L233206,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Yeah, that's what we need. More agents."
34409,L233205,u1078,m70,KAREN,"With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?"
34410,L233192,u1077,m70,HARRY,That's where you got the idea?
34411,L233191,u1078,m70,KAREN,"That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy."
34412,L233147,u1078,m70,KAREN,Maybe you didn't hear me.
34413,L233146,u1077,m70,HARRY,"He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks."
34414,L233145,u1078,m70,KAREN,How did you get in the house?
34415,L233104,u1077,m70,HARRY,I'm going.
34416,L233103,u1078,m70,KAREN,Harry -
34417,L233102,u1077,m70,HARRY,Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
34418,L233101,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?"
34419,L233100,u1077,m70,HARRY,You don't? What happened to Muff?
34420,L233099,u1078,m70,KAREN,I don't have a dog.
34421,L233098,u1077,m70,HARRY,"Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on."
34422,L233097,u1078,m70,KAREN,"When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room."
34423,L233094,u1077,m70,HARRY,I don't hear anything.
34424,L233093,u1078,m70,KAREN,Be quiet and listen.
34425,L233092,u1077,m70,HARRY,What's wrong?
34426,L234009,u1077,m70,HARRY,Shylock?
34427,L234008,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock."
34428,L234007,u1077,m70,HARRY,What money?
34429,L234006,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?"
34430,L234002,u1077,m70,HARRY,Mob guy?
34431,L234001,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love."
34432,L234000,u1077,m70,HARRY,Which two?
34433,L234004,u1078,m70,KAREN,"And after all, you have such morals."
34434,L234003,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with."
34435,L233992,u1078,m70,KAREN,Thanks.
34436,L233991,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too."
34437,L233677,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey -  This your ride, Chili?"
34438,L233676,u1078,m70,KAREN,But you are interested?
34439,L233675,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"Yeah, Karen knows him."
34440,L233674,u1078,m70,KAREN,Lufkin. His... agent.
34441,L233628,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to."
34442,L233627,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Oh, for Christ's sake -"
34443,L233602,u1078,m70,KAREN,"'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party."
34444,L233601,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?"
34445,L233600,u1078,m70,KAREN,Really.
34446,L233599,u1081,m70,MARTIN,"I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us."
34447,L233591,u1078,m70,KAREN,"Hello, Martin."
34448,L233590,u1081,m70,MARTIN,Karen. Wow. Look at you...
34449,L235878,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out."

34458,L235787,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"North Island, please repeat? Over."
34459,L235692,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out."
34460,L235691,u1085,m71,COASTGUARD DISPATCHER,"Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over."
34461,L235690,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Passenger vessel ""Chimera."" I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over."
34462,L235689,u1085,m71,COASTGUARD DISPATCHER,"What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over."
34463,L235688,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"A passenger liner, north island. Over."
34464,L235687,u1085,m71,COASTGUARD DISPATCHER,Say again. Over.
34465,L235686,u1089,m71,MURPHY,A passenger liner. Over.
34466,L235685,u1085,m71,COASTGUARD DISPATCHER,"Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?"
34467,L235684,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention."
34468,L235683,u1085,m71,COASTGUARD DISPATCHER,"Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over."
34469,L236157,u1088,m71,GREER,After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
34470,L236156,u1086,m71,DODGE,You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
34471,L236131,u1088,m71,GREER,"Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?"
34472,L236130,u1086,m71,DODGE,The turbine blew.
34473,L236129,u1088,m71,GREER,Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
34474,L236128,u1086,m71,DODGE,"When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal."
34475,L236081,u1086,m71,DODGE,Wrong. It's Friday.
34476,L236080,u1088,m71,GREER,I don't know. Tuesday?
34477,L236079,u1086,m71,DODGE,What day is it?
34478,L235992,u1086,m71,DODGE,"You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it."
34479,L235991,u1088,m71,GREER,"I ain't no mechanic, just so you know."
34480,L235990,u1086,m71,DODGE,"I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do."
34481,L235983,u1088,m71,GREER,"Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place."
34482,L235982,u1086,m71,DODGE,Let's not be too hasty.
34483,L235921,u1088,m71,GREER,She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
34484,L235920,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure."
34485,L235893,u1088,m71,GREER,"We'll see who's dreamin', m'man."
34486,L235892,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about."
34487,L235889,u1088,m71,GREER,It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
34488,L235888,u1086,m71,DODGE,What's so great about Sweden?
34489,L235865,u1088,m71,GREER,Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
34490,L235864,u1086,m71,DODGE,"One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire."
34491,L235805,u1088,m71,GREER,"Morning, skipper."
34492,L235804,u1086,m71,DODGE,Damn mind of it's own.
34493,L235803,u1088,m71,GREER,"Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal."
34494,L235802,u1086,m71,DODGE,Fucker!
34495,L235798,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?"
34496,L235797,u1088,m71,GREER,"Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge."
34497,L235745,u1086,m71,DODGE,Lemme see.
34498,L235744,u1088,m71,GREER,That's what it says.
34499,L235743,u1086,m71,DODGE,What? You sure?
34500,L235742,u1088,m71,GREER,Sixty pounds.
34501,L235741,u1086,m71,DODGE,How about now?
34502,L235730,u1086,m71,DODGE,Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
34503,L235729,u1088,m71,GREER,You think the extra strain caused it?
34504,L235714,u1088,m71,GREER,"I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size."
34505,L235713,u1086,m71,DODGE,They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
34506,L235712,u1088,m71,GREER,"Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?"
34507,L235575,u1086,m71,DODGE,With that coxswain dickhead.
34508,L235574,u1088,m71,GREER,Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
34509,L235549,u1086,m71,DODGE,I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
34510,L235548,u1088,m71,GREER,"Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem."
34511,L236215,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Yeah, yeah."
34512,L236214,u1087,m71,EPPS,Get up.
34513,L236213,u1086,m71,DODGE,What?
34514,L236212,u1087,m71,EPPS,Dodge.  Dodge.
34515,L236162,u1087,m71,EPPS,Why not?
34516,L236161,u1086,m71,DODGE,"What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?"
34517,L236100,u1086,m71,DODGE,Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
34518,L236099,u1087,m71,EPPS,Did you?
34519,L236083,u1086,m71,DODGE,Right. Wednesday.
34520,L236082,u1087,m71,EPPS,Try Wednesday.
34521,L236018,u1086,m71,DODGE,Then what the hell happened to him?
34522,L236017,u1087,m71,EPPS,"Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside."
34523,L236015,u1086,m71,DODGE,I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
34524,L236014,u1087,m71,EPPS,"I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?"
34525,L236013,u1086,m71,DODGE,A what?
34526,L236012,u1087,m71,EPPS,I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
34527,L235960,u1087,m71,EPPS,Oh yeah.
34528,L235959,u1086,m71,DODGE,Smokes?
34529,L235952,u1087,m71,EPPS,Seen a lota movies.
34530,L235951,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?"
34531,L235939,u1087,m71,EPPS,Maybe he isn't alone.
34532,L235938,u1086,m71,DODGE,One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
34533,L235934,u1086,m71,DODGE,I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
34534,L235933,u1087,m71,EPPS,So we kill him?
34535,L235932,u1086,m71,DODGE,Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
34536,L235923,u1086,m71,DODGE,Gimme a break.
34537,L235922,u1087,m71,EPPS,Maybe that is his boat.
34538,L235917,u1087,m71,EPPS,"I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody."
34539,L235916,u1086,m71,DODGE,Light in those passages ain't so good.
34540,L235885,u1087,m71,EPPS,I like my job.
34541,L235884,u1086,m71,DODGE,What're you crazy?
34542,L235883,u1087,m71,EPPS,Guess I'll just keep working.
34543,L235875,u1086,m71,DODGE,"I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now."
34544,L235874,u1087,m71,EPPS,What other choices have we got?
34545,L235870,u1086,m71,DODGE,Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
34546,L235869,u1087,m71,EPPS,This's gonna hurt a little.
34547,L235851,u1087,m71,EPPS,Or uninvited guests.
34548,L235850,u1086,m71,DODGE,Last thing we want is extra partners.
34549,L235800,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't."
34550,L235799,u1087,m71,EPPS,"If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot."
34551,L235718,u1087,m71,EPPS,"Ever heard of insurance, big boy?"
34552,L235717,u1086,m71,DODGE,Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
34553,L235698,u1087,m71,EPPS,"Bring it on, dude."
34554,L235697,u1086,m71,DODGE,Ready?
34555,L235696,u1086,m71,DODGE,Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
34556,L235695,u1087,m71,EPPS,Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
34557,L235694,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?"
34558,L235666,u1086,m71,DODGE,Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
34559,L235665,u1087,m71,EPPS,"Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?"
34560,L235664,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current."
34561,L235623,u1087,m71,EPPS,No.
34562,L235622,u1086,m71,DODGE,You think that's funny
34563,L235621,u1086,m71,DODGE,Yeah.
34564,L235620,u1087,m71,EPPS,Roger?
34565,L235619,u1086,m71,DODGE,Roger.
34566,L235617,u1086,m71,DODGE,Maureen?
34567,L235616,u1087,m71,EPPS,Maureen.
34568,L235615,u1086,m71,DODGE,What?
34569,L235614,u1087,m71,EPPS,Maureen.
34570,L235613,u1086,m71,DODGE,It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
34571,L235612,u1087,m71,EPPS,What?
34572,L235611,u1086,m71,DODGE,What is your first name?
34573,L235610,u1086,m71,DODGE,Why not.
34574,L235609,u1087,m71,EPPS,One more?
34575,L235547,u1087,m71,EPPS,Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
34576,L235546,u1086,m71,DODGE,Where from?
34577,L236219,u1086,m71,DODGE,Right.
34578,L236218,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Don't fall asleep.
34579,L236217,u1086,m71,DODGE,Sorry.
34580,L236216,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You're late.
34581,L236159,u1086,m71,DODGE,There's a charming thought.
34582,L236158,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
34583,L236146,u1086,m71,DODGE,Right.
34584,L236145,u1089,m71,MURPHY,We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
34585,L236144,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Then you're a lucky man.
34586,L236143,u1086,m71,DODGE,I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
34587,L236142,u1089,m71,MURPHY,If money can buy what he wants.
34588,L236141,u1086,m71,DODGE,That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
34589,L236118,u1086,m71,DODGE,Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
34590,L236117,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What the hell happened!
34591,L236116,u1086,m71,DODGE,You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
34592,L236115,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Yeah.
34593,L236065,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?"
34594,L236064,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Conveniently enough for you.
34595,L236063,u1086,m71,DODGE,"I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?"
34596,L236062,u1086,m71,DODGE,I didn't touch the fucking radio.
34597,L236061,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
34598,L236060,u1086,m71,DODGE,What the fuck -- ?
34599,L236059,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Don't lie to me!
34600,L236058,u1086,m71,DODGE,What?!
34601,L236057,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You smashed it!
34602,L236056,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!"
34603,L236055,u1086,m71,DODGE,"The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio."
34604,L236054,u1089,m71,MURPHY,The radio!
34605,L236053,u1086,m71,DODGE,Maybe you can tell me then.
34606,L236052,u1089,m71,MURPHY,I think you know.
34607,L236051,u1086,m71,DODGE,I don't know what you're talking about?
34608,L236050,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
34609,L236048,u1086,m71,DODGE,"With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it."
34610,L236047,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is."
34611,L236046,u1086,m71,DODGE,"For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them."
34612,L236045,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What do you propose?
34613,L236044,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal."
34614,L236043,u1089,m71,MURPHY,I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
34615,L236042,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all."
34616,L236041,u1089,m71,MURPHY,How do you mean?
34617,L236040,u1086,m71,DODGE,"So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?"
34618,L236035,u1089,m71,MURPHY,If they knew what they were carrying.
34619,L236034,u1086,m71,DODGE,On a passenger ship in 1953?
34620,L236023,u1086,m71,DODGE,Not me.
34621,L236022,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?"
34622,L236008,u1086,m71,DODGE,I think you better see this for yourself.
34623,L236007,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What is it?
34624,L236006,u1086,m71,DODGE,"You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on ""C"" deck. Cabin 400."
34625,L236005,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Murphy.
34626,L236004,u1086,m71,DODGE,Dodge to Murphy.
34627,L235989,u1086,m71,DODGE,Right.
34628,L235988,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
34629,L235987,u1086,m71,DODGE,I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
34630,L235986,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Can't you use something else?
34631,L235978,u1086,m71,DODGE,So whoever did this might still be around.
34632,L235977,u1089,m71,MURPHY,That'd be my guess.
34633,L235974,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Could be meant as a warning.
34634,L235973,u1086,m71,DODGE,Damn barbaric is what it is.
34635,L235970,u1086,m71,DODGE,Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
34636,L235969,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Bodies're too fresh.
34637,L235950,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up."
34638,L235949,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options."
34639,L235943,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first."
34640,L235942,u1086,m71,DODGE,What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
34641,L235931,u1086,m71,DODGE,Why not? Why the fuck not?
34642,L235930,u1089,m71,MURPHY,And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
34643,L235929,u1086,m71,DODGE,I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
34644,L235926,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Not in the eyes of the law.
34645,L235925,u1086,m71,DODGE,Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
34646,L235924,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs."
34647,L235900,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand."
34648,L235899,u1086,m71,DODGE,Sounds like the hull.
34649,L235895,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Yeah, yeah."
34650,L235894,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
34651,L235882,u1089,m71,MURPHY,How about you Epps?
34652,L235881,u1086,m71,DODGE,I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
34653,L235855,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours."
34654,L235854,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Yeah, yeah. I'm on it."
34655,L235845,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is."
34656,L235844,u1086,m71,DODGE,"You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?"
34657,L235841,u1089,m71,MURPHY,It looks like it.
34658,L235840,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich."
34659,L235839,u1089,m71,MURPHY,A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
34660,L235838,u1086,m71,DODGE,"So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?"
34661,L235836,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason."
34662,L235835,u1086,m71,DODGE,Or somebody stopped them.
34663,L235829,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Then it happened before they scuttled her.
34664,L235828,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat."
34665,L235821,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?"
34666,L235820,u1086,m71,DODGE,"What, you think there's something funny about it?"
34667,L235819,u1089,m71,MURPHY,It's a hell of a lot of money.
34668,L235810,u1089,m71,MURPHY,She take a radio?
34669,L235809,u1086,m71,DODGE,Went aboard.
34670,L235796,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway."
34671,L235795,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
34672,L235782,u1086,m71,DODGE,"What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper."
34673,L235781,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Goddamit, Dodge."
34674,L235780,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Three, four days."
34675,L235779,u1089,m71,MURPHY,How long?
34676,L235778,u1086,m71,DODGE,I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
34677,L235777,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"How long, then?"
34678,L235776,u1086,m71,DODGE,It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
34679,L235775,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What about running number two by itself?
34680,L235774,u1086,m71,DODGE,"I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is."
34681,L235773,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history."
34682,L235772,u1086,m71,DODGE,Hard to say.
34683,L235771,u1089,m71,MURPHY,But how long?
34684,L235770,u1086,m71,DODGE,The right way and the wrong way.
34685,L235769,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"I know I know, two ways to do anything --"
34686,L235768,u1086,m71,DODGE,Like I always say --
34687,L235767,u1089,m71,MURPHY,How much longer's that gonna take?
34688,L235766,u1086,m71,DODGE,Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
34689,L235765,u1089,m71,MURPHY,I thought you said it was just a blade.
34690,L235764,u1086,m71,DODGE,Turbine rotor's shot.
34691,L235763,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What's this?
34692,L235728,u1086,m71,DODGE,Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
34693,L235727,u1089,m71,MURPHY,How long to fix?
34694,L235726,u1086,m71,DODGE,"The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered."
34695,L235724,u1086,m71,DODGE,Threw a turbine blade.
34696,L235723,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What is it?
34697,L235722,u1086,m71,DODGE,Mother fucker!
34698,L235711,u1086,m71,DODGE,Sounds reasonable.
34699,L235710,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop."
34700,L235677,u1089,m71,MURPHY,The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
34701,L235676,u1086,m71,DODGE,It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
34702,L235673,u1089,m71,MURPHY,It's a risk I'm willing to take.
34703,L235672,u1086,m71,DODGE,If you get it back in one piece.
34704,L235671,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
34705,L235670,u1086,m71,DODGE,"Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over."
34706,L235637,u1086,m71,DODGE,Smugglers maybe.
34707,L235636,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
34708,L235577,u1086,m71,DODGE,Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
34709,L235576,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?"
34710,L236263,u1088,m71,GREER,I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
34711,L236262,u1087,m71,EPPS,I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
34712,L236251,u1087,m71,EPPS,Nothing. Let's get outa here.
34713,L236250,u1088,m71,GREER,What?
34714,L236249,u1087,m71,EPPS,Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
34715,L236248,u1088,m71,GREER,You okay?
34716,L236231,u1087,m71,EPPS,Better than starving to death.
34717,L236230,u1088,m71,GREER,I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
34718,L236078,u1088,m71,GREER,I feel fine.
34719,L236077,u1087,m71,EPPS,Sudden flashes of light.
34720,L236076,u1088,m71,GREER,Lights?
34721,L236075,u1087,m71,EPPS,"Headache, nausea, lights?"
34722,L236074,u1088,m71,GREER,No.
34723,L236073,u1087,m71,EPPS,Any dizziness?
34724,L235976,u1087,m71,EPPS,Because of the gold.
34725,L235975,u1088,m71,GREER,Stay away. Or else.
34726,L235956,u1087,m71,EPPS,You're a pal.
34727,L235955,u1088,m71,GREER,Coffee.
34728,L235919,u1087,m71,EPPS,Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
34729,L235918,u1088,m71,GREER,What'd he look like?
34730,L235891,u1088,m71,GREER,"Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better."
34731,L235890,u1087,m71,EPPS,That's a good thing?
34732,L235859,u1088,m71,GREER,Hell yeah.
34733,L235858,u1087,m71,EPPS,That's what I call a payday.
34734,L235857,u1088,m71,GREER,Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
34735,L235834,u1087,m71,EPPS,Probably didn't have time.
34736,L235833,u1088,m71,GREER,Then why didn't they take it.
34737,L235831,u1088,m71,GREER,Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
34738,L235830,u1087,m71,EPPS,"You mean, before she sank."
34739,L235740,u1088,m71,GREER,"He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure."
34740,L235739,u1087,m71,EPPS,Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
34741,L235635,u1088,m71,GREER,Too big. More like a freighter.
34742,L235634,u1087,m71,EPPS,Could be a fishing boat.
34743,L235603,u1088,m71,GREER,I bet you did.
34744,L235602,u1087,m71,EPPS,Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
34745,L235601,u1088,m71,GREER,"Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?"
34746,L235600,u1087,m71,EPPS,Morning everybody.
34747,L235545,u1087,m71,EPPS,Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
34748,L235544,u1088,m71,GREER,What's slow?
34749,L236333,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice."
34750,L236332,u1087,m71,EPPS,I don't give a damn about the gold.
34751,L236331,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple."
34752,L236330,u1087,m71,EPPS,It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
34753,L236329,u1089,m71,MURPHY,I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
34754,L236328,u1087,m71,EPPS,It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
34755,L236327,u1089,m71,MURPHY,I think I see it pretty well.
34756,L236326,u1087,m71,EPPS,"Murphy, don't you see what's happening?"
34757,L236325,u1089,m71,MURPHY,I didn't want it to turn out this way.
34758,L236324,u1087,m71,EPPS,"And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?"
34759,L236323,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends."
34760,L236322,u1087,m71,EPPS,So you killed them?
34761,L236321,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so."
34762,L236320,u1087,m71,EPPS,You killed them.
34763,L236313,u1087,m71,EPPS,Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
34764,L236312,u1089,m71,MURPHY,We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
34765,L236311,u1087,m71,EPPS,What?
34766,L236310,u1089,m71,MURPHY,We hit land.
34767,L236309,u1087,m71,EPPS,What happened?
34768,L236283,u1089,m71,MURPHY,It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
34769,L236282,u1087,m71,EPPS,If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
34770,L236281,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water."
34771,L236279,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
34772,L236278,u1087,m71,EPPS,They went crazy.
34773,L236277,u1087,m71,EPPS,Maybe it was more than that.
34774,L236276,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Over the gold.
34775,L236275,u1087,m71,EPPS,"Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. ""Like wild dogs."""
34776,L236274,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What do you think?
34777,L236256,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here."
34778,L236255,u1087,m71,EPPS,What do we do with him?
34779,L236243,u1087,m71,EPPS,Right here.
34780,L236242,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Epps? You there?
34781,L236236,u1089,m71,MURPHY,He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
34782,L236235,u1087,m71,EPPS,Nope.
34783,L236234,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Either of you seen Dodge?
34784,L236233,u1087,m71,EPPS,"Epps, over."
34785,L236232,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Murphy to Epps.
34786,L236207,u1087,m71,EPPS,Just lucky I guess.
34787,L236206,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
34788,L236205,u1087,m71,EPPS,I don't know.
34789,L236204,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What's that supposed to mean?
34790,L236203,u1087,m71,EPPS,"She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave."
34791,L236202,u1087,m71,EPPS,More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
34792,L236201,u1089,m71,MURPHY,That much I think we've already established.
34793,L236200,u1087,m71,EPPS,"Something bad happened here, Murphy."
34794,L236199,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Victims of what?
34795,L236198,u1087,m71,EPPS,"No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims."
34796,L236197,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
34797,L236196,u1087,m71,EPPS,What happened.
34798,L236195,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Showing you what?
34799,L236194,u1087,m71,EPPS,Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
34800,L236192,u1087,m71,EPPS,"I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone."
34801,L236191,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"What, like some kind of ghost?"
34802,L236189,u1087,m71,EPPS,No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
34803,L236188,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Not our mystery guest again.
34804,L236187,u1087,m71,EPPS,"When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone."
34805,L236186,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"I don't know, are we?"
34806,L236185,u1087,m71,EPPS,Are we smart enough to avoid that?
34807,L236184,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time."
34808,L236183,u1087,m71,EPPS,The what?
34809,L236182,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?"
34810,L236181,u1087,m71,EPPS,What do you think happened on this boat?
34811,L236180,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Wish I could say the same.
34812,L236179,u1087,m71,EPPS,Couldn't sleep.
34813,L236178,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Hey.
34814,L236177,u1087,m71,EPPS,Hey.
34815,L236174,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Doesn't matter.
34816,L236173,u1087,m71,EPPS,It's not gonna hold us.
34817,L236127,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
34818,L236126,u1087,m71,EPPS,It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
34819,L236113,u1089,m71,MURPHY,If it was a ship she hit.
34820,L236112,u1087,m71,EPPS,Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
34821,L236111,u1089,m71,MURPHY,But where's the damage?
34822,L236110,u1087,m71,EPPS,The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
34823,L236109,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Collision? With what?
34824,L236108,u1087,m71,EPPS,"""Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."""
34825,L236107,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
34826,L236106,u1087,m71,EPPS,The same day she supposedly went down.
34827,L236105,u1089,m71,MURPHY,February first.
34828,L236104,u1087,m71,EPPS,"""The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."""
34829,L236097,u1087,m71,EPPS,"But, who -- ?"
34830,L236096,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Smashed it up pretty bad.
34831,L236095,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Somebody took it out of commission last night.
34832,L236094,u1087,m71,EPPS,What?
34833,L236093,u1089,m71,MURPHY,The ah... the radio's out.
34834,L236038,u1087,m71,EPPS,Only something must've gone wrong.
34835,L236037,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats."
34836,L236036,u1087,m71,EPPS,You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
34837,L236033,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
34838,L236032,u1087,m71,EPPS,They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
34839,L236031,u1089,m71,MURPHY,No. I'll try again later.
34840,L236030,u1087,m71,EPPS,Same. Any luck?
34841,L236029,u1089,m71,MURPHY,How's he doing?
34842,L236025,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him."
34843,L236024,u1087,m71,EPPS,He needs a doctor.
34844,L236021,u1089,m71,MURPHY,I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
34845,L236020,u1087,m71,EPPS,Greer?
34846,L236019,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
34847,L235966,u1087,m71,EPPS,Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
34848,L235965,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You just shoot at something?
34849,L235964,u1087,m71,EPPS,Epps.
34850,L235963,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Murphy to Epps.
34851,L235958,u1087,m71,EPPS,Yup.
34852,L235957,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Got your light?
34853,L235954,u1087,m71,EPPS,No cowboy shit. Right.
34854,L235953,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"No cowboy shit up there, understand?"
34855,L235945,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?"
34856,L235944,u1087,m71,EPPS,Guess that'd be me. Again.
34857,L235928,u1089,m71,MURPHY,We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
34858,L235927,u1087,m71,EPPS,"So, we find this guy and make a deal with him."
34859,L235915,u1087,m71,EPPS,It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
34860,L235914,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You sure it wasn't me?
34861,L235913,u1087,m71,EPPS,Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
34862,L235912,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Are you sure?
34863,L235911,u1087,m71,EPPS,I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
34864,L235910,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What? What the hell're you talking about.
34865,L235909,u1087,m71,EPPS,There's somebody else on this boat.
34866,L235908,u1089,m71,MURPHY,What guy?
34867,L235907,u1087,m71,EPPS,The guy. He just came this way.
34868,L235906,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Who?
34869,L235905,u1087,m71,EPPS,Did you see him?
34870,L235904,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Take it easy, you'll live longer."
34871,L235849,u1089,m71,MURPHY,For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
34872,L235848,u1087,m71,EPPS,Why not call for help?
34873,L235825,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
34874,L235824,u1087,m71,EPPS,Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
34875,L235762,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Only way to be.
34876,L235761,u1087,m71,EPPS,You're more practical than superstitious.
34877,L235760,u1089,m71,MURPHY,I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
34878,L235759,u1087,m71,EPPS,You think she's sailing without a crew?
34879,L235758,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure."
34880,L235757,u1087,m71,EPPS,So what did happen?
34881,L235756,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard."
34882,L235755,u1087,m71,EPPS,Nope.
34883,L235754,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
34884,L235752,u1087,m71,EPPS,"Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her."
34885,L235751,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Her destination was Halifax, yeah."
34886,L235750,u1087,m71,EPPS,"She was sailing up north, right?"
34887,L235749,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
34888,L235748,u1087,m71,EPPS,What'd you find up there?
34889,L235747,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Yeah. Thanks.
34890,L235746,u1087,m71,EPPS,Coffee?
34891,L235716,u1087,m71,EPPS,They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
34892,L235715,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try."
34893,L235680,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways."
34894,L235679,u1087,m71,EPPS,Go on.
34895,L235605,u1087,m71,EPPS,It's my pen name.
34896,L235604,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Candy?
34897,L236265,u1088,m71,GREER,Fine with me.
34898,L236264,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that."
34899,L236261,u1088,m71,GREER,All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
34900,L236260,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You think whoever did this is reasonable?
34901,L236259,u1088,m71,GREER,Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
34902,L236258,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Leave it.
34903,L236257,u1088,m71,GREER,What about the gold?
34904,L236254,u1088,m71,GREER,Doesn't look like it much matters.
34905,L236253,u1089,m71,MURPHY,So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
34906,L236252,u1088,m71,GREER,Can't find the shotgun.
34907,L236238,u1088,m71,GREER,Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
34908,L236237,u1089,m71,MURPHY,He took the shotgun and a light.
34909,L236172,u1089,m71,MURPHY,The mooring hasn't come taught.
34910,L236171,u1088,m71,GREER,We're still drifting.
34911,L236168,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
34912,L236167,u1088,m71,GREER,A what?
34913,L236166,u1089,m71,MURPHY,It's a Noaa buoy.
34914,L236135,u1088,m71,GREER,"Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?"
34915,L236134,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Shut up.
34916,L236133,u1088,m71,GREER,"Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say."
34917,L236125,u1089,m71,MURPHY,The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
34918,L236124,u1088,m71,GREER,We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
34919,L236120,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
34920,L236119,u1088,m71,GREER,We're not gonna be able to pump it!
34921,L236092,u1088,m71,GREER,I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
34922,L236091,u1089,m71,MURPHY,We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
34923,L236090,u1088,m71,GREER,"Oh, man."
34924,L236089,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
34925,L236088,u1088,m71,GREER,Say what?
34926,L236087,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You've been out for about a day.
34927,L236086,u1088,m71,GREER,Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
34928,L236085,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You don't remember?
34929,L236084,u1088,m71,GREER,What happened?
34930,L236072,u1088,m71,GREER,Lost my sea legs.
34931,L236071,u1089,m71,MURPHY,How're you feeling?
34932,L236070,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Drink up then.
34933,L236069,u1088,m71,GREER,Never been more thirsty in my life.
34934,L235980,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Maybe.
34935,L235979,u1088,m71,GREER,Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
34936,L235972,u1088,m71,GREER,And look what happened.
34937,L235971,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
34938,L235968,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
34939,L235967,u1088,m71,GREER,Ho-ly shit.
34940,L235947,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around."
34941,L235946,u1088,m71,GREER,Pretty low all around.
34942,L235941,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here."
34943,L235940,u1088,m71,GREER,I say we off-load some of that gold now.
34944,L235937,u1088,m71,GREER,Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
34945,L235936,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody."
34946,L235935,u1088,m71,GREER,I don't know.
34947,L235887,u1088,m71,GREER,Moving to Sweden.
34948,L235886,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Greer?
34949,L235880,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that."
34950,L235879,u1088,m71,GREER,"Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?"
34951,L235873,u1088,m71,GREER,And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
34952,L235872,u1089,m71,MURPHY,We could call for help.
34953,L235871,u1088,m71,GREER,What now?
34954,L235853,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs."
34955,L235852,u1088,m71,GREER,I heard that.
34956,L235847,u1089,m71,MURPHY,It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
34957,L235846,u1088,m71,GREER,"Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka."
34958,L235843,u1089,m71,MURPHY,We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
34959,L235842,u1088,m71,GREER,So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
34960,L235823,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for."
34961,L235822,u1088,m71,GREER,"If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off."
34962,L235816,u1088,m71,GREER,"Ho, baby!"
34963,L235815,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million."
34964,L235814,u1088,m71,GREER,"How much you figure that's worth, skipper?"
34965,L235808,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
34966,L235807,u1088,m71,GREER,You're up late.
34967,L235806,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Morning.
34968,L235732,u1088,m71,GREER,Yeah.
34969,L235731,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Some classy tub in it's day, huh?"
34970,L235675,u1089,m71,MURPHY,So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
34971,L235674,u1088,m71,GREER,All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
34972,L235669,u1089,m71,MURPHY,We've done it before.
34973,L235668,u1088,m71,GREER,You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
34974,L235667,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her."
34975,L235660,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Sorry.
34976,L235659,u1088,m71,GREER,"Murphy, goddamit."
34977,L235655,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved."
34978,L235654,u1088,m71,GREER,How's that?
34979,L235653,u1089,m71,MURPHY,It's funny.
34980,L235641,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
34981,L235640,u1088,m71,GREER,Call the Coastguard?
34982,L235633,u1088,m71,GREER,Looks like it's adrift.
34983,L235632,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Too deep to anchor out there.
34984,L235628,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Alright. I'll be right up.
34985,L235627,u1088,m71,GREER,I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
34986,L235626,u1088,m71,GREER,There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
34987,L235625,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Yeah.
34988,L235607,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Red sky in morning, sailor take warning."
34989,L235606,u1088,m71,GREER,"Red sky at night, sailor's delight."
34990,L235572,u1088,m71,GREER,"Better than ""making hamburger for Mickey D."""
34991,L235571,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You got that right.
34992,L235570,u1088,m71,GREER,I must be in the wrong business.
34993,L235569,u1089,m71,MURPHY,He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
34994,L235568,u1088,m71,GREER,Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
34995,L235555,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"What do you say, Dodge?"
34996,L235554,u1088,m71,GREER,Let the buyer beware.
34997,L235553,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Of course they did.
34998,L235552,u1088,m71,GREER,"The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka."
34999,L235551,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Go.
35000,L235550,u1088,m71,GREER,Greer to Murphy.
35001,L235594,u1090,m71,RIVETER,Or what?
35002,L235593,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan."
35003,L235592,u1090,m71,RIVETER,These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
35004,L235591,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go."
35005,L235590,u1090,m71,RIVETER,"Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?"
35006,L235589,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"As I said, what seems to be the trouble?"
35007,L235588,u1090,m71,RIVETER,"Whyn't you mind your own business, chief."
35008,L235587,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"What seems to be the trouble, ladies?"
35009,L235567,u1091,m71,VASILI,"You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign."
35010,L235566,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"You're kidding, right?"
35011,L235565,u1091,m71,VASILI,Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
35012,L235564,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"Fifteen, at the most."
35013,L235563,u1091,m71,VASILI,That cost me twenty grand at least.
35014,L235562,u1089,m71,MURPHY,"You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new."
35015,L235561,u1091,m71,VASILI,"No, no. You got leak."
35016,L235560,u1089,m71,MURPHY,You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
35017,L235559,u1091,m71,VASILI,What's this?
35018,L235558,u1089,m71,MURPHY,Better late than never.
35019,L235557,u1091,m71,VASILI,I thought you say Tuesday.
35020,L237484,u1094,m72,ENID,JUST DO IT!
35021,L237483,u1092,m72,DAD,But I can't --
35022,L237482,u1094,m72,ENID,What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
35023,L237481,u1092,m72,DAD,I just buzzed him in.
35024,L237480,u1094,m72,ENID,"What do you mean ""on his way up""!?"
35025,L237479,u1092,m72,DAD,"Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up."
35026,L237478,u1094,m72,ENID,"I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe."
35027,L237477,u1092,m72,DAD,She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
35028,L237476,u1094,m72,ENID,"I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days."
35029,L237475,u1092,m72,DAD,"Yeah, I heard about that."
35030,L237474,u1092,m72,DAD,About what?
35031,L237473,u1094,m72,ENID,Are you going to yell at me?
35032,L237472,u1092,m72,DAD,"Pumpkin, are you in there?"
35033,L237363,u1092,m72,DAD,"Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want."
35034,L237362,u1094,m72,ENID,What?
35035,L237361,u1092,m72,DAD,"I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling..."
35036,L237360,u1094,m72,ENID,It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
35037,L237358,u1094,m72,ENID,Nothing.
35038,L237357,u1092,m72,DAD,Pumpkin? What's wrong?
35039,L237298,u1094,m72,ENID,Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
35040,L237297,u1092,m72,DAD,"Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them."
35041,L237296,u1094,m72,ENID,I guess.
35042,L237295,u1092,m72,DAD,Are you still looking for a job?
35043,L237294,u1094,m72,ENID,What is it now?
35044,L237293,u1092,m72,DAD,"I have some good news for you, Pumpkin."
35045,L237154,u1094,m72,ENID,I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
35046,L237153,u1092,m72,DAD,I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
35047,L237152,u1094,m72,ENID,"Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed."
35048,L236925,u1094,m72,ENID,"God, how horrifying."
35049,L236924,u1092,m72,DAD,Yup.
35050,L236923,u1094,m72,ENID,Not the Maxine?
35051,L236922,u1092,m72,DAD,Maxine.
35052,L236921,u1094,m72,ENID,YES.
35053,L236920,u1092,m72,DAD,Give up?
35054,L236919,u1094,m72,ENID,Who?
35055,L236918,u1092,m72,DAD,Someone from the past.
35056,L236917,u1094,m72,ENID,How should I know?
35057,L236916,u1092,m72,DAD,Guess.
35058,L236915,u1094,m72,ENID,Who?
35059,L236914,u1092,m72,DAD,Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
35060,L236913,u1094,m72,ENID,Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
35061,L236912,u1092,m72,DAD,"Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to."
35062,L236911,u1094,m72,ENID,"Look, I told you I'm not going to college."
35063,L236910,u1092,m72,DAD,It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
35064,L236909,u1094,m72,ENID,Will you get off my back for once?
35065,L236667,u1092,m72,DAD,Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
35066,L236666,u1094,m72,ENID,"Nope. What are you making, pancakes?"
35067,L236665,u1092,m72,DAD,Have you seen my blue spatula?
35068,L237453,u1093,m72,DANA,I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
35069,L237452,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
35070,L237451,u1093,m72,DANA,Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
35071,L237450,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
35072,L237449,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
35073,L237448,u1093,m72,DANA,What are you trying to say?
35074,L237447,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh..."
35075,L237446,u1093,m72,DANA,"Hey... so, what brings you down here?"
35076,L237444,u1093,m72,DANA,"We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!"
35077,L237443,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
35078,L237442,u1093,m72,DANA,Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
35079,L237285,u1093,m72,DANA,Hello...
35080,L237284,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid..."
35081,L237283,u1093,m72,DANA,Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
35082,L237208,u1093,m72,DANA,Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
35083,L237207,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies."
35084,L237206,u1093,m72,DANA,"I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!"
35085,L237205,u1093,m72,DANA,"Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away."
35086,L237204,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie."
35087,L237202,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"No, really I --"
35088,L237201,u1093,m72,DANA,"Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet."
35089,L237200,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh..."
35090,L237199,u1093,m72,DANA,"Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!"
35091,L237198,u1093,m72,DANA,"Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up."
35092,L237197,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
35093,L237196,u1093,m72,DANA,"Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?"
35094,L237195,u1093,m72,DANA,"Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?"
35095,L237194,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this."
35096,L237376,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --"
35097,L237375,u1094,m72,ENID,But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
35098,L237374,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
35099,L237373,u1094,m72,ENID,Help me what?
35100,L237372,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you."
35101,L237371,u1094,m72,ENID,I didn't check my messages...
35102,L237370,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
35103,L237369,u1094,m72,ENID,Huh?
35104,L237368,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
35105,L237367,u1094,m72,ENID,What do you mean?
35106,L237366,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
35107,L237172,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you."
35108,L237171,u1094,m72,ENID,I...
35109,L237170,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"Well, yes..."
35110,L237169,u1094,m72,ENID,I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
35111,L237168,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,So what do you think?
35112,L237167,u1094,m72,ENID,...wow...
35113,L237166,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
35114,L237165,u1094,m72,ENID,Hmm.
35115,L237164,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name."
35116,L237163,u1094,m72,ENID,"I'm not really sure - working, I guess..."
35117,L237162,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
35118,L237161,u1094,m72,ENID,Uh-oh.
35119,L237160,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?"
35120,L237044,u1094,m72,ENID,I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
35121,L237043,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,And how does an image like this help us to see that?
35122,L237042,u1094,m72,ENID,"It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something..."
35123,L237041,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
35124,L237040,u1094,m72,ENID,"Well, no - it's more like a ""found art object."""
35125,L237039,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,Did you actually do this painting?
35126,L237038,u1094,m72,ENID,"Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture..."
35127,L237037,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this."
35128,L236955,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,I see... interesting...
35129,L236954,u1094,m72,ENID,I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
35130,L236953,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
35131,L236952,u1094,m72,ENID,It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
35132,L236951,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"Who is this, Enid?"
35133,L236748,u1094,m72,ENID,Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
35134,L236747,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,And what can you tell us about this...
35135,L237075,u1094,m72,ENID,Jesus...
35136,L237074,u1102,m72,MANAGER,It's not optional!
35137,L237073,u1094,m72,ENID,But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
35138,L237072,u1102,m72,MANAGER,Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
35139,L237071,u1094,m72,ENID,What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
35140,L237070,u1102,m72,MANAGER,What the hell is wrong with you?!
35141,L237065,u1094,m72,ENID,"Okay, okay... I won't say a word..."
35142,L237064,u1102,m72,MANAGER,"Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job."
35143,L237063,u1094,m72,ENID,But I was only trying to be friendly...
35144,L237062,u1102,m72,MANAGER,"Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater..."
35145,L237061,u1094,m72,ENID,Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
35146,L237060,u1102,m72,MANAGER,What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
35147,L237057,u1094,m72,ENID,"You can count on me, sir!"
35148,L237056,u1102,m72,MANAGER,I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
35149,L237566,u1100,m72,JOSH,Are you ready to go?
35150,L237565,u1094,m72,ENID,Hey Josh.
35151,L237564,u1100,m72,JOSH,Hi Enid.
35152,L237262,u1094,m72,ENID,Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
35153,L237261,u1100,m72,JOSH,Okay... I promise.
35154,L237260,u1094,m72,ENID,"Because if you do, I'll kill you!"
35155,L237259,u1100,m72,JOSH,Why not?
35156,L237258,u1094,m72,ENID,"I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this."
35157,L237257,u1100,m72,JOSH,Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
35158,L237256,u1094,m72,ENID,I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
35159,L237255,u1100,m72,JOSH,How long have you been up?
35160,L237254,u1094,m72,ENID,Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
35161,L237253,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Oh, hi..."
35162,L237252,u1094,m72,ENID,Why do you have that stupid poster?
35163,L237251,u1100,m72,JOSH,You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
35164,L237249,u1094,m72,ENID,"It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!"
35165,L237248,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Yeah, well --"
35166,L237247,u1094,m72,ENID,That's just the way I am!
35167,L237246,u1100,m72,JOSH,You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
35168,L237245,u1094,m72,ENID,You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
35169,L237244,u1100,m72,JOSH,When did I say I hated you?
35170,L237243,u1094,m72,ENID,Then why do you hate me so much?
35171,L237242,u1100,m72,JOSH,Nothing.
35172,L237241,u1094,m72,ENID,"""Yeah, right""... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?"
35173,L237240,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Yeah, right..."
35174,L237239,u1094,m72,ENID,Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
35175,L237238,u1100,m72,JOSH,"What do you mean ""why""?"
35176,L237237,u1094,m72,ENID,Why?
35177,L237236,u1100,m72,JOSH,Do you want something to drink?
35178,L237232,u1094,m72,ENID,I guess.
35179,L237231,u1100,m72,JOSH,Are you the one who left that note?
35180,L237230,u1094,m72,ENID,Can I come in?
35181,L237229,u1100,m72,JOSH,Hi... what's up?
35182,L236846,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Yeah, well... hi..."
35183,L236845,u1094,m72,ENID,I just stopped in to say hi.
35184,L236844,u1100,m72,JOSH,Hi.
35185,L236843,u1094,m72,ENID,Hi Josh.
35186,L236580,u1100,m72,JOSH,You need counseling.
35187,L236579,u1094,m72,ENID,"But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat..."
35188,L236578,u1100,m72,JOSH,No.
35189,L236577,u1094,m72,ENID,"Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?"
35190,L236576,u1100,m72,JOSH,Forget it.
35191,L236571,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh my God, that's HIM!"
35192,L236570,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Jesus, look at this guy."
35193,L236553,u1094,m72,ENID,I figured something like that...
35194,L236552,u1100,m72,JOSH,"In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form..."
35195,L236551,u1094,m72,ENID,"That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out."
35196,L236547,u1094,m72,ENID,"No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell."
35197,L236546,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Yeah, right."
35198,L236538,u1094,m72,ENID,SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
35199,L236537,u1100,m72,JOSH,"So, where's ""Weird Al""?"
35200,L236536,u1094,m72,ENID,"This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners."
35201,L236535,u1100,m72,JOSH,Aren't there a million places like this?
35202,L236527,u1094,m72,ENID,It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
35203,L236526,u1100,m72,JOSH,Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
35204,L236523,u1100,m72,JOSH,No.
35205,L236522,u1094,m72,ENID,"So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!"
35206,L236521,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do..."
35207,L236520,u1094,m72,ENID,That guy rules!
35208,L236517,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done."
35209,L236516,u1094,m72,ENID,So Josh...
35210,L236508,u1094,m72,ENID,I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
35211,L236507,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside."
35212,L236506,u1094,m72,ENID,"What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of ""frozen yogurt""?"
35213,L236505,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride."
35214,L236504,u1094,m72,ENID,"Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder."
35215,L237563,u1094,m72,ENID,It just came yesterday...
35216,L237562,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Wow... finally.
35217,L237560,u1094,m72,ENID,Maybe an orange juice.
35218,L237559,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Do you want anything?
35219,L237558,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Actually, he's a really nice guy."
35220,L237557,u1094,m72,ENID,"You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps."
35221,L237556,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!"
35222,L237555,u1094,m72,ENID,Hi.
35223,L237506,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
35224,L237505,u1094,m72,ENID,I dunno...
35225,L237504,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What time?
35226,L237503,u1094,m72,ENID,I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
35227,L237502,u1106,m72,REBECCA,That's all you're bringing?
35228,L237501,u1094,m72,ENID,There.
35229,L237500,u1106,m72,REBECCA,So where's all your stuff?
35230,L237499,u1094,m72,ENID,It's fine.
35231,L237498,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"So, whaddya think?"
35232,L237471,u1094,m72,ENID,"I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off."
35233,L237470,u1106,m72,REBECCA,But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
35234,L237469,u1094,m72,ENID,Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
35235,L237468,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
35236,L237467,u1094,m72,ENID,Please let me come with you. Please please please...
35237,L237466,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
35238,L237465,u1094,m72,ENID,I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
35239,L237464,u1094,m72,ENID,I need to talk to you.
35240,L237463,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Hello?
35241,L237355,u1106,m72,REBECCA,FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
35242,L237354,u1094,m72,ENID,You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
35243,L237353,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
35244,L237352,u1094,m72,ENID,Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
35245,L237351,u1106,m72,REBECCA,There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
35246,L237350,u1094,m72,ENID,"Well, what am I supposed to say? ""I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere""?!"
35247,L237349,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!"
35248,L237348,u1094,m72,ENID,"I said ""great""..."
35249,L237347,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
35250,L237346,u1094,m72,ENID,Great...
35251,L237345,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
35252,L237344,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes."
35253,L237343,u1094,m72,ENID,When was this?
35254,L237342,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Nothing.
35255,L237341,u1094,m72,ENID,Why? What did he say?
35256,L237340,u1106,m72,REBECCA,He came into work.
35257,L237339,u1094,m72,ENID,What? When did you see Josh?!
35258,L237338,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
35259,L237337,u1094,m72,ENID,I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
35260,L237336,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!"
35261,L237335,u1094,m72,ENID,Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
35262,L237228,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow."
35263,L237227,u1094,m72,ENID,I don't believe you.
35264,L237226,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Just some people from work...
35265,L237225,u1094,m72,ENID,What are you talking about? Who?
35266,L237224,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends..."
35267,L237223,u1094,m72,ENID,So should I come over?
35268,L237222,u1106,m72,REBECCA,How repulsive!
35269,L237221,u1094,m72,ENID,I can't believe it - he actually scored!
35270,L237220,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What happened to Seymour?
35271,L237219,u1094,m72,ENID,Do you still want to do something tonight?
35272,L237218,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Hello?
35273,L237193,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"God, I'm so sick of Seymour."
35274,L237192,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went."
35275,L237191,u1106,m72,REBECCA,That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
35276,L237190,u1094,m72,ENID,What thing?
35277,L237189,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
35278,L237188,u1094,m72,ENID,You're insane.
35279,L237187,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
35280,L237186,u1094,m72,ENID,I can't imagine spending money on towels.
35281,L237185,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Don't you want nice stuff?
35282,L237184,u1094,m72,ENID,Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
35283,L237183,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
35284,L237182,u1094,m72,ENID,I can't afford stuff like this right now.
35285,L237181,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Look, we have to get these..."
35286,L237180,u1106,m72,REBECCA,No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
35287,L237179,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try..."
35288,L237178,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that..."
35289,L237177,u1094,m72,ENID,I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
35290,L237176,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"God, you're really obsessed..."
35291,L237175,u1094,m72,ENID,"No, really..."
35292,L237174,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Go ahead...
35293,L237173,u1094,m72,ENID,I think one of us should fuck Josh...
35294,L237110,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, I guess... call me..."
35295,L237109,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?"
35296,L237108,u1094,m72,ENID,"I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake..."
35297,L237107,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Do you want to do something tonight?
35298,L237106,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, thanks."
35299,L237105,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff."
35300,L237104,u1094,m72,ENID,Don't worry.
35301,L237103,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Now are you going to get a regular job?
35302,L237089,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus."
35303,L237088,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
35304,L237083,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase..."
35305,L237082,u1094,m72,ENID,Fuck it. Everything must go!
35306,L237081,u1106,m72,REBECCA,This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
35307,L237079,u1094,m72,ENID,"I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime..."
35308,L237078,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
35309,L237055,u1094,m72,ENID,We were such desperate sluts back then.
35310,L237054,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
35311,L237053,u1094,m72,ENID,That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
35312,L237052,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
35313,L237051,u1094,m72,ENID,Wasn't it like eighth grade?
35314,L237050,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?"
35315,L237049,u1094,m72,ENID,"I dunno, but next week is my last class..."
35316,L237048,u1106,m72,REBECCA,When are you finally going to get your diploma?
35317,L237047,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated..."
35318,L237046,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job..."
35319,L236950,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Get away from me!
35320,L236949,u1094,m72,ENID,...maybe we should be lesbos...
35321,L236948,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
35322,L236947,u1094,m72,ENID,"That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration."
35323,L236946,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!"
35324,L236945,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!"
35325,L236944,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You're just jealous.
35326,L236933,u1094,m72,ENID,He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
35327,L236932,u1106,m72,REBECCA,He gives me a total boner!
35328,L236931,u1094,m72,ENID,Which one?
35329,L236930,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You're gross.  See that guy?
35330,L236929,u1094,m72,ENID,Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
35331,L236928,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
35332,L236927,u1094,m72,ENID,I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
35333,L236926,u1106,m72,REBECCA,...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
35334,L236906,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me."
35335,L236905,u1094,m72,ENID,Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
35336,L236904,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Like what?
35337,L236903,u1094,m72,ENID,"I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time."
35338,L236902,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?"
35339,L236901,u1094,m72,ENID,But those are our people...
35340,L236900,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos."
35341,L236899,u1094,m72,ENID,That rules!
35342,L236898,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!"
35343,L236897,u1094,m72,ENID,At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
35344,L236896,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody."
35345,L236895,u1094,m72,ENID,"God, how can you stand all these assholes?"
35346,L236891,u1106,m72,REBECCA,He does that every single day.
35347,L236890,u1094,m72,ENID,That guy is totally amazing.
35348,L236886,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You cunt!
35349,L236885,u1094,m72,ENID,Just now... I went with Seymour.
35350,L236884,u1106,m72,REBECCA,No way... when?
35351,L236883,u1094,m72,ENID,Anthony's II!
35352,L236882,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Where?
35353,L236881,u1094,m72,ENID,You won't believe it! Guess!
35354,L236880,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Where did you get that?
35355,L236879,u1094,m72,ENID,"Give me all your money, bitch!"
35356,L236797,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Wait...
35357,L236796,u1094,m72,ENID,"I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer."
35358,L236784,u1094,m72,ENID,"Aw c'mon, this is a fun party."
35359,L236783,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"I totally, totally hate you."
35360,L236777,u1094,m72,ENID,"If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?"
35361,L236776,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I don't believe you.
35362,L236775,u1094,m72,ENID,It's a surprise.
35363,L236774,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What? Where?!
35364,L236773,u1094,m72,ENID,I know a party we could go to...
35365,L236772,u1106,m72,REBECCA,We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
35366,L236771,u1094,m72,ENID,"Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick."
35367,L236768,u1094,m72,ENID,Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
35368,L236767,u1106,m72,REBECCA,How about this?
35369,L236766,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?"
35370,L236765,u1094,m72,ENID,This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
35371,L236764,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Ew ... when did you get that?
35372,L236763,u1094,m72,ENID,"Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm."
35373,L236762,u1106,m72,REBECCA,How about this one?
35374,L236721,u1094,m72,ENID,Everybody's too stupid!
35375,L236720,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I didn't get it either.
35376,L236719,u1094,m72,ENID,"It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!"
35377,L236718,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What was that all about?
35378,L236700,u1094,m72,ENID,It'll only take a second.
35379,L236699,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Why are we going here? I hate this place.
35380,L236696,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Should we leave a note?
35381,L236695,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that."
35382,L236694,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I'll bet he never jerks off...
35383,L236691,u1106,m72,REBECCA,JOSH!
35384,L236690,u1094,m72,ENID,JOSH!
35385,L236683,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Why don't you ask him.
35386,L236682,u1094,m72,ENID,I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
35387,L236681,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Waiting for the bus that never comes...
35388,L236680,u1094,m72,ENID,As always.
35389,L236679,u1106,m72,REBECCA,There he is...
35390,L236678,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"""Hassle""?"
35391,L236677,u1094,m72,ENID,Let's go hassle Josh.
35392,L236676,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Where are we going?
35393,L236674,u1094,m72,ENID,I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
35394,L236673,u1106,m72,REBECCA,It's always closed...
35395,L236672,u1094,m72,ENID,We still have to go in there sometime.
35396,L236671,u1094,m72,ENID,"Fuck you, bitch!"
35397,L236670,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
35398,L236669,u1094,m72,ENID,What? How long have you been standing there?
35399,L236664,u1094,m72,ENID,"Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind."
35400,L236663,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Just promise you'll do it.
35401,L236662,u1094,m72,ENID,You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
35402,L236661,u1106,m72,REBECCA,That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
35403,L236660,u1094,m72,ENID,What are you talking about?
35404,L236659,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
35405,L236658,u1094,m72,ENID,"What, is she black now?"
35406,L236657,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"""Funky""?"
35407,L236655,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Somewhere downtown.
35408,L236654,u1094,m72,ENID,"We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking."
35409,L236645,u1094,m72,ENID,"Forget it, I can't explain it..."
35410,L236644,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Not really...
35411,L236643,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, but... you know what I mean."
35412,L236642,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"That guy is many things but he definitely isn't ""cool""... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen..."
35413,L236641,u1094,m72,ENID,I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
35414,L236640,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats..."
35415,L236639,u1094,m72,ENID,Oh yeah...
35416,L236638,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"What about the ""striking redhead in the yellow dress""?"
35417,L236637,u1094,m72,ENID,It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
35418,L236636,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive..."
35419,L236635,u1094,m72,ENID,"I know... I still can't get over that his name was ""Seymour."""
35420,L236634,u1106,m72,REBECCA,That was truly pathetic.
35421,L236602,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Ew, it's like some gross rat..."
35422,L236601,u1094,m72,ENID,I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
35423,L236600,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Gross!
35424,L236599,u1094,m72,ENID,"Ew, look at this..."
35425,L236598,u1094,m72,ENID,"Come on, it's too late now..."
35426,L236597,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
35427,L236594,u1094,m72,ENID,Bingo!
35428,L236593,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!"
35429,L236589,u1094,m72,ENID,"I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again."
35430,L236588,u1106,m72,REBECCA,He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
35431,L236587,u1094,m72,ENID,This is way too creepy.
35432,L236584,u1094,m72,ENID,This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
35433,L236583,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
35434,L236582,u1094,m72,ENID,"He doesn't even look that bummed out, really."
35435,L236575,u1106,m72,REBECCA,We should follow him home.
35436,L236574,u1094,m72,ENID,He's insane!
35437,L236573,u1094,m72,ENID,Totally! Look!
35438,L236572,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Are you sure?
35439,L236566,u1094,m72,ENID,I dunno...
35440,L236565,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Do you think he knows?
35441,L236561,u1094,m72,ENID,"He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!"
35442,L236560,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What's he doing now?
35443,L236558,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!"
35444,L236557,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What's going on now? What's he doing?
35445,L236556,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I can't believe it!
35446,L236555,u1094,m72,ENID,It's obviously him!
35447,L236550,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
35448,L236549,u1094,m72,ENID,Is he wearing a green cardigan?
35449,L236544,u1094,m72,ENID,She says she wants to MMPH!
35450,L236543,u1106,m72,REBECCA,SHUT UP!
35451,L236540,u1094,m72,ENID,I'm going to tell him you said that.
35452,L236539,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"I want to ""make love"" to him."
35453,L236534,u1094,m72,ENID,It's still twenty-five minutes early.
35454,L236533,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Look, maybe that's him!"
35455,L236532,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!"
35456,L236531,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man."
35457,L236530,u1094,m72,ENID,"God, I think Josh is too mature for us."
35458,L236501,u1094,m72,ENID,"Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP."
35459,L236500,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What does it stand for?
35460,L236499,u1094,m72,ENID,"I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for ""dwarf!"""
35461,L236498,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You're better at it.
35462,L236497,u1094,m72,ENID,Why do I always have to do it?
35463,L236496,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You call.
35464,L236495,u1094,m72,ENID,Oh yeah.
35465,L236494,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"You know, the green cardigan guy."
35466,L236493,u1094,m72,ENID,Which loser?
35467,L236492,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
35468,L236491,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Fuck you!
35469,L236490,u1094,m72,ENID,That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
35470,L236489,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What are you talking about -- who?
35471,L236488,u1094,m72,ENID,"I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick."
35472,L236487,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I want to do him!
35473,L236478,u1094,m72,ENID,"No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!"
35474,L236477,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
35475,L236476,u1094,m72,ENID,There's my dad with Joanie.
35476,L236475,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I remember every minute of that party.
35477,L236474,u1094,m72,ENID,"Look, that's back when I hated you."
35478,L236473,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What a little hosebag.
35479,L236472,u1094,m72,ENID,Look at how cute I am!
35480,L236471,u1094,m72,ENID,I've been looking all over for this.
35481,L236470,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
35482,L236469,u1094,m72,ENID,Hey - why do you have this?
35483,L236466,u1094,m72,ENID,I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
35484,L236465,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What is this?
35485,L236464,u1094,m72,ENID,Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
35486,L236463,u1106,m72,REBECCA,So what should we do?
35487,L236461,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
35488,L236460,u1094,m72,ENID,Does Oomie really like this show?
35489,L236455,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh, we totally have to."
35490,L236454,u1106,m72,REBECCA,We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
35491,L236453,u1094,m72,ENID,I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
35492,L236452,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him."
35493,L236451,u1094,m72,ENID,"Jesus! Listen to this one: ""Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"""
35494,L236448,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Gross.
35495,L236447,u1094,m72,ENID,"Okay, well here's yours...  ""Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."""
35496,L236446,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You can have that one.
35497,L236445,u1094,m72,ENID,"God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  ""Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"""
35498,L236444,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
35499,L236443,u1094,m72,ENID,What does that even mean?
35500,L236442,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"I know... and instead of ""dessert"" it says ""Mindbenders."""
35501,L236441,u1094,m72,ENID,"Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like ""The Salad Explosion""?"
35502,L236439,u1094,m72,ENID,You loser!
35503,L236438,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I might actually get the pasta special.
35504,L236433,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Can we call you ""Weird Al""?"
35505,L236432,u1094,m72,ENID,"Hi, Al!"
35506,L236429,u1094,m72,ENID,I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
35507,L236428,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
35508,L236427,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"God, it's so totally pathetic."
35509,L236426,u1094,m72,ENID,"""Authentic 50's diner""? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?"
35510,L236425,u1094,m72,ENID,"Hey, look at this..."
35511,L236424,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Okay, okay!"
35512,L236423,u1094,m72,ENID,Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
35513,L236422,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Or maybe not.
35514,L236421,u1094,m72,ENID,Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
35515,L236420,u1106,m72,REBECCA,That lets us off the hook.
35516,L236419,u1094,m72,ENID,"You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff..."
35517,L236418,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?"
35518,L236417,u1094,m72,ENID,"In fact, never."
35519,L236416,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Much later.
35520,L236411,u1094,m72,ENID,We should follow them!
35521,L236410,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!"
35522,L236401,u1094,m72,ENID,"I know, it hasn't really hit me yet."
35523,L236400,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling."
35524,L236399,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest."
35525,L236398,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Did you sign up yet?
35526,L236397,u1094,m72,ENID,Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
35527,L236396,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?"
35528,L236395,u1094,m72,ENID,Just look at them!
35529,L236394,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Why?
35530,L236393,u1094,m72,ENID,Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
35531,L236392,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Hi.
35532,L236391,u1094,m72,ENID,"God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing."
35533,L236390,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Good.
35534,L236389,u1094,m72,ENID,"God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again."
35535,L236388,u1094,m72,ENID,He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
35536,L236387,u1106,m72,REBECCA,How perfect.
35537,L236386,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?"
35538,L236369,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"I know, she needs to die immediately."
35539,L236368,u1094,m72,ENID,"Since when is she an ""actress""?"
35540,L236360,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Forget it...
35541,L236359,u1094,m72,ENID,What? Why?
35542,L236358,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Uh oh... don't turn around...
35543,L236357,u1094,m72,ENID,Shut up!
35544,L236356,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Unless they're in your Summer school class!
35545,L236355,u1094,m72,ENID,"Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again."
35546,L236354,u1094,m72,ENID,This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
35547,L236353,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"This is so bad, it's almost good."
35548,L236352,u1106,m72,REBECCA,You loser.
35549,L236351,u1094,m72,ENID,"Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an ""F"" that means you have to take the class over again."
35550,L236350,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Why?
35551,L236349,u1094,m72,ENID,These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
35552,L236348,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What?
35553,L236347,u1094,m72,ENID,What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
35554,L236346,u1106,m72,REBECCA,It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
35555,L236345,u1094,m72,ENID,"I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her."
35556,L236344,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
35557,L236343,u1094,m72,ENID,"God, what a bunch of retards..."
35558,L236384,u1094,m72,ENID,"See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid."
35559,L236383,u1110,m72,TODD,"Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications."
35560,L236382,u1094,m72,ENID,"What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?"
35561,L236379,u1094,m72,ENID,Just because.
35562,L236378,u1110,m72,TODD,Really? Both of you?... Why not?
35563,L236377,u1094,m72,ENID,We're not.
35564,L236374,u1110,m72,TODD,"Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!"
35565,L236373,u1094,m72,ENID,What about me? Am I not even here?
35566,L236650,u1105,m72,MELORRA,"I love this place... it's so - you know, ""funky."""
35567,L236649,u1094,m72,ENID,"Well, we won't keep you."
35568,L236648,u1105,m72,MELORRA,My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
35569,L236647,u1094,m72,ENID,"What are you doing here, Melorra?"
35570,L236646,u1105,m72,MELORRA,"Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?"
35571,L236367,u1105,m72,MELORRA,"Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!"
35572,L236366,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen..."
35573,L236365,u1105,m72,MELORRA,"I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!"
35574,L236364,u1094,m72,ENID,Nothing.
35575,L236363,u1105,m72,MELORRA,So what are you guys doing this Summer?
35576,L236362,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing."
35577,L236361,u1105,m72,MELORRA,"Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!"
35578,L237460,u1104,m72,MAXINE,"Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do."
35579,L237459,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh yeah, like he even noticed."
35580,L237458,u1104,m72,MAXINE,"I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!"
35581,L237457,u1094,m72,ENID,Shhh!
35582,L237456,u1104,m72,MAXINE,May I ask what you're doing?
35583,L237156,u1094,m72,ENID,I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
35584,L237155,u1104,m72,MAXINE,"It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl."
35585,L237314,u1094,m72,ENID,Where did you get those pants?
35586,L237313,u1097,m72,JOE,"Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room."
35587,L236733,u1094,m72,ENID,It's kind of falling apart.
35588,L236732,u1097,m72,JOE,I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
35589,L236731,u1094,m72,ENID,I thought it wasn't for sale.
35590,L236730,u1097,m72,JOE,You still interested in that?
35591,L236615,u1097,m72,JOE,Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
35592,L236614,u1094,m72,ENID,Who does?
35593,L236613,u1097,m72,JOE,Seymour does.
35594,L236612,u1094,m72,ENID,Do you have any other old records besides these?
35595,L236611,u1094,m72,ENID,That's okay...
35596,L236610,u1097,m72,JOE,"Perhaps the ""Jam-in-ator"" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button."
35597,L236608,u1097,m72,JOE,Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
35598,L236607,u1094,m72,ENID,How much is this?
35599,L236606,u1097,m72,JOE,A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
35600,L236605,u1094,m72,ENID,A what?
35601,L236717,u1099,m72,JOHN ELLIS,Get a job!
35602,L236716,u1094,m72,ENID,"Go die, asshole!"
35603,L236715,u1099,m72,JOHN ELLIS,I'm so sorry if you were offended!
35604,L236714,u1094,m72,ENID,"That tape sucked, by the way!"
35605,L236713,u1099,m72,JOHN ELLIS,"Oh, how ""punk."""
35606,L236712,u1099,m72,JOHN ELLIS,Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
35607,L236711,u1094,m72,ENID,That's not even --
35608,L236710,u1099,m72,JOHN ELLIS,"If you really want to ""fuck up the system"" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!"
35609,L236709,u1094,m72,ENID,"I know it's over, asshole, I --"
35610,L236708,u1099,m72,JOHN ELLIS,Punk rock is over!
35611,L236707,u1094,m72,ENID,Tell me what?
35612,L236706,u1099,m72,JOHN ELLIS,Didn't they tell you?
35613,L236689,u1101,m72,MAN,You don't know what you're talking about.
35614,L236688,u1094,m72,ENID,I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
35615,L236687,u1101,m72,MAN,Yes.
35616,L236686,u1094,m72,ENID,...are you waiting for a bus?
35617,L236685,u1101,m72,MAN,Norman.
35618,L236684,u1094,m72,ENID,Hi... what's your name?
35619,L236415,u1094,m72,ENID,"Later, ""Dude""."
35620,L236414,u1098,m72,JOHN,"Hey, where are you going?"
35621,L236413,u1094,m72,ENID,"Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke."
35622,L236409,u1094,m72,ENID,"Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!"
35623,L236408,u1098,m72,JOHN,Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
35624,L236407,u1094,m72,ENID,I did too!
35625,L236406,u1098,m72,JOHN,You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
35626,L236405,u1094,m72,ENID,Did you bring that tape?
35627,L236404,u1098,m72,JOHN,"Fine, and how are you?"
35628,L236403,u1094,m72,ENID,"You're late, asshole."
35629,L236402,u1098,m72,JOHN,"Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend."
35630,L237099,u1096,m72,GIRL,"God, fuck you!"
35631,L237098,u1094,m72,ENID,Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
35632,L237097,u1096,m72,GIRL,Well why do I care about that?
35633,L237096,u1094,m72,ENID,I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
35634,L237095,u1096,m72,GIRL,You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
35635,L237094,u1094,m72,ENID,Five hundred.
35636,L237093,u1096,m72,GIRL,What?
35637,L237092,u1094,m72,ENID,That's five hundred dollars.
35638,L237462,u1094,m72,ENID,I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
35639,L237461,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
35640,L237439,u1094,m72,ENID,Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
35641,L237438,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"But, I..."
35642,L237437,u1094,m72,ENID,"I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up..."
35643,L237436,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
35644,L237435,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, well... me neither..."
35645,L237434,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
35646,L237433,u1094,m72,ENID,No... forget it...
35647,L237432,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I will if you want to.
35648,L237431,u1094,m72,ENID,What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
35649,L237430,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
35650,L237429,u1094,m72,ENID,"God, Dana's going to kill you!"
35651,L237428,u1094,m72,ENID,"What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!"
35652,L237427,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I-I-I...
35653,L237426,u1094,m72,ENID,What do you want?
35654,L237425,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What do you want?
35655,L237424,u1094,m72,ENID,I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
35656,L237423,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"I dunno, I..."
35657,L237422,u1094,m72,ENID,Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
35658,L237421,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,So where would we go?
35659,L237420,u1094,m72,ENID,"I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!"
35660,L237419,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
35661,L237418,u1094,m72,ENID,You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
35662,L237417,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
35663,L237416,u1094,m72,ENID,"It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again."
35664,L237415,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
35665,L237414,u1094,m72,ENID,I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
35666,L237413,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What?
35667,L237412,u1094,m72,ENID,You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
35668,L237411,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, well I like you too..."
35669,L237410,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you."
35670,L237409,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What about Joe?
35671,L237408,u1094,m72,ENID,...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
35672,L237407,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, sure. Of course."
35673,L237406,u1094,m72,ENID,"I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?"
35674,L237405,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
35675,L237404,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that."
35676,L237403,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity."
35677,L237402,u1094,m72,ENID,"How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?"
35678,L237401,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I hate sports.
35679,L237400,u1094,m72,ENID,At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
35680,L237399,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I'm just being realistic.
35681,L237398,u1094,m72,ENID,What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
35682,L237397,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed."
35683,L237396,u1094,m72,ENID,"That's great! ""Half-empty"" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!"
35684,L237395,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!"
35685,L237394,u1094,m72,ENID,"Jesus, how can you stand her?"
35686,L237393,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my ""old time thingamajigs."""
35687,L237392,u1094,m72,ENID,Where did you get this?
35688,L237391,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
35689,L237390,u1094,m72,ENID,You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
35690,L237389,u1094,m72,ENID,FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
35691,L237388,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
35692,L237387,u1094,m72,ENID,What about this?
35693,L237386,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Uh... I think there's some root beer...
35694,L237385,u1094,m72,ENID,Do you have anything to drink?
35695,L237384,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What's the matter?
35696,L237383,u1094,m72,ENID,"Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone."
35697,L237382,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Uh... sure... come in.
35698,L237381,u1094,m72,ENID,Can you at least let me in?
35699,L237380,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What's up?
35700,L237379,u1094,m72,ENID,I had to see you.
35701,L237378,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What are you doing here?
35702,L237334,u1094,m72,ENID,"Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more."
35703,L237333,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,...What do you mean?
35704,L237332,u1094,m72,ENID,"I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour."
35705,L237331,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends..."
35706,L237330,u1094,m72,ENID,In whatever way you think I mean.
35707,L237329,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,In what way do you mean?
35708,L237328,u1094,m72,ENID,"So, do you like me, Seymour?"
35709,L237327,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"No, of course not."
35710,L237326,u1094,m72,ENID,Does that mean you don't like me?
35711,L237325,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I... I don't think so.
35712,L237324,u1094,m72,ENID,You must have done something to make her think you like me.
35713,L237323,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Just someone so young...
35714,L237322,u1094,m72,ENID,"What does she mean by that - ""somebody like me""?"
35715,L237321,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you..."
35716,L237320,u1094,m72,ENID,What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
35717,L237319,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --"
35718,L237318,u1094,m72,ENID,So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
35719,L237317,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me..."
35720,L237316,u1094,m72,ENID,And you like them?
35721,L237315,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana."
35722,L237312,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know..."
35723,L237311,u1094,m72,ENID,Well when can we do something?
35724,L237310,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --"
35725,L237309,u1094,m72,ENID,Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
35726,L237308,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,...I better not...
35727,L237307,u1094,m72,ENID,"Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late."
35728,L237306,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
35729,L237305,u1094,m72,ENID,I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
35730,L237282,u1094,m72,ENID,"Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time..."
35731,L237281,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,...so... is he your boyfriend now?
35732,L237280,u1094,m72,ENID,"I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally..."
35733,L237279,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
35734,L237278,u1094,m72,ENID,Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
35735,L237277,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --"
35736,L237276,u1094,m72,ENID,"What, are you trying to get rid of me?"
35737,L237275,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
35738,L237274,u1094,m72,ENID,Sounds good...
35739,L237273,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon..."
35740,L237272,u1094,m72,ENID,"So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?"
35741,L237271,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know..."
35742,L237270,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?"
35743,L237269,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy..."
35744,L237268,u1094,m72,ENID,"No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?"
35745,L237267,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Really?
35746,L237266,u1094,m72,ENID,Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
35747,L237265,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,YAAA!
35748,L237264,u1094,m72,ENID,Boo!
35749,L237217,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!"
35750,L237216,u1094,m72,ENID,"What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?"
35751,L237215,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk..."
35752,L237214,u1094,m72,ENID,What? You're kidding me...
35753,L237213,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well..."
35754,L237212,u1094,m72,ENID,"So, what happened?"
35755,L237211,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Oh, hi..."
35756,L237210,u1094,m72,ENID,"Hi, it's me..."
35757,L237209,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Uh... hello?
35758,L237148,u1094,m72,ENID,"Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!"
35759,L237147,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,How can you be so sure?
35760,L237146,u1094,m72,ENID,Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
35761,L237145,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
35762,L237144,u1094,m72,ENID,"That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?"
35763,L237143,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
35764,L237142,u1094,m72,ENID,Wow!  What was that all about?
35765,L237139,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
35766,L237138,u1094,m72,ENID,Aren't you going to get that?
35767,L237137,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Who knows?
35768,L237136,u1094,m72,ENID,I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
35769,L237135,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I won't even dignify that with a response.
35770,L237134,u1094,m72,ENID,"Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?"
35771,L237133,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Why?
35772,L237132,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out."
35773,L237131,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Oh yeah?
35774,L237130,u1094,m72,ENID,"Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation..."
35775,L237129,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you."
35776,L237128,u1094,m72,ENID,I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
35777,L237127,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
35778,L237126,u1094,m72,ENID,Never...
35779,L237125,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Really?
35780,L237124,u1094,m72,ENID,"I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!"
35781,L237123,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,That's the spirit!
35782,L237122,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships..."
35783,L237121,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
35784,L237120,u1094,m72,ENID,"What, like a girdle?"
35785,L237119,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
35786,L237118,u1094,m72,ENID,What is that?
35787,L237117,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
35788,L237116,u1094,m72,ENID,Are you okay?
35789,L237115,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
35790,L237114,u1094,m72,ENID,"No, Doofus... blow it out!"
35791,L237113,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it..."
35792,L237112,u1094,m72,ENID,You can open your eyes now.
35793,L237030,u1094,m72,ENID,"Don't you trust me, Seymour?"
35794,L237029,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
35795,L237028,u1094,m72,ENID,I promise I'll take good care of it.
35796,L237027,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What? Why?
35797,L237026,u1094,m72,ENID,"Hey, can I borrow this?"
35798,L237025,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something..."
35799,L237024,u1094,m72,ENID,"So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?"
35800,L237023,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?
35801,L237022,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, but still..."
35802,L237021,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me..."
35803,L237020,u1094,m72,ENID,"Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day."
35804,L237019,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters."
35805,L237018,u1094,m72,ENID,"What are you, a fry cook or something?"
35806,L237017,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,For nineteen years...
35807,L237016,u1094,m72,ENID,You work at Cook's Chicken?
35808,L237015,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them..."
35809,L237011,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, well ""Cook's"" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named ""The Coon Chicken Inn"" -- that's an early painting of their first logo."
35810,L237010,u1094,m72,ENID,"""Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS""!"
35811,L237009,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?"
35812,L237008,u1094,m72,ENID,"What, are you a klansman or something?"
35813,L237007,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
35814,L237006,u1094,m72,ENID,"What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?"
35815,L237005,u1094,m72,ENID,I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
35816,L237004,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
35817,L237003,u1094,m72,ENID,"Wow, this is so cool..."
35818,L237002,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"""Yet."""
35819,L237001,u1094,m72,ENID,"It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet."
35820,L237000,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
35821,L236999,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Hooray for me.
35822,L236998,u1094,m72,ENID,I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
35823,L236997,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
35824,L236996,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless..."
35825,L236995,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity."
35826,L236994,u1094,m72,ENID,It's not hopeless...
35827,L236993,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless."
35828,L236992,u1094,m72,ENID,"We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all."
35829,L236991,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
35830,L236990,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Jesus...
35831,L236989,u1094,m72,ENID,I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
35832,L236988,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What did you tell that girl?
35833,L236981,u1094,m72,ENID,Just wait here.
35834,L236980,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No..."
35835,L236979,u1094,m72,ENID,"Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?"
35836,L236978,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yes, that would certainly do..."
35837,L236975,u1094,m72,ENID,"Jesus, Seymour."
35838,L236974,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?"
35839,L236973,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I'm not holding my breath in that department.
35840,L236972,u1094,m72,ENID,This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
35841,L236971,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
35842,L236970,u1094,m72,ENID,"So, why did you bring this along?"
35843,L236969,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
35844,L236968,u1094,m72,ENID,"Relax, Seymour, relax..."
35845,L236874,u1094,m72,ENID,"C'mon, Seymour, please?"
35846,L236873,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Uh, I don't have much money with me right now."
35847,L236868,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
35848,L236867,u1094,m72,ENID,"Look at this -- ""Lollipop Lolitas"" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?"
35849,L236864,u1094,m72,ENID,OH MY GOD!
35850,L236863,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Shh!
35851,L236862,u1094,m72,ENID,Wow! Look at all these creeps!
35852,L236861,u1094,m72,ENID,"Fine, I'll go by myself then..."
35853,L236860,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I really don't think it's a good idea.
35854,L236859,u1094,m72,ENID,PLEASE? We have to!
35855,L236858,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I don't think so...
35856,L236857,u1094,m72,ENID,We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
35857,L236856,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I - I'd really rather not...
35858,L236855,u1094,m72,ENID,"Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?"
35859,L236854,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, sure... very funny...."
35860,L236853,u1094,m72,ENID,Oh my god! We have to go in here!
35861,L236852,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Well are --
35862,L236851,u1094,m72,ENID,Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
35863,L236850,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,So is that your boyfriend?
35864,L236842,u1094,m72,ENID,"Let's just say ""music"" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second..."
35865,L236841,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably..."
35866,L236840,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance."
35867,L236839,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
35868,L236838,u1094,m72,ENID,We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
35869,L236835,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
35870,L236834,u1094,m72,ENID,Every guy has a type!
35871,L236833,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"I'm just not one of those guys who has a ""type""..."
35872,L236832,u1094,m72,ENID,"C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?"
35873,L236831,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Jesus!
35874,L236830,u1094,m72,ENID,"Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?"
35875,L236829,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I really didn't get a good look at her.
35876,L236828,u1094,m72,ENID,"But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?"
35877,L236827,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me..."
35878,L236826,u1094,m72,ENID,What about her? Would you go out with her?
35879,L236825,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
35880,L236824,u1094,m72,ENID,"Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!"
35881,L236823,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
35882,L236822,u1094,m72,ENID,I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
35883,L236821,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, well..."
35884,L236820,u1094,m72,ENID,I'm totally serious!
35885,L236819,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Good luck...
35886,L236818,u1094,m72,ENID,No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
35887,L236817,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Oh, right..."
35888,L236816,u1094,m72,ENID,I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
35889,L236815,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me."
35890,L236814,u1094,m72,ENID,"No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour."
35891,L236813,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
35892,L236812,u1094,m72,ENID,"Oh, come on! What are you talking about?"
35893,L236811,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me."
35894,L236810,u1094,m72,ENID,"God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!"
35895,L236809,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
35896,L236808,u1094,m72,ENID,Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
35897,L236807,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know..."
35898,L236806,u1094,m72,ENID,Really? Can I see it?
35899,L236805,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
35900,L236804,u1094,m72,ENID,You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
35901,L236803,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
35902,L236802,u1094,m72,ENID,What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
35903,L236738,u1094,m72,ENID,"Hey, I was only kidding!"
35904,L236737,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,NO!!!
35905,L236736,u1094,m72,ENID,Oops! I dropped it!
35906,L236729,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Watch my stuff.
35907,L236728,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, sure, I guess..."
35908,L236727,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
35909,L236726,u1094,m72,ENID,Wow!
35910,L236725,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies."
35911,L236724,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, ""Devil Got My Woman"" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?"
35912,L236723,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?"
35913,L236722,u1094,m72,ENID,"Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --"
35914,L236631,u1094,m72,ENID,Okay.
35915,L236630,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,A dollar seventy-five.
35916,L236629,u1094,m72,ENID,How much is it?
35917,L236628,u1094,m72,ENID,Wow!
35918,L236627,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue."
35919,L236626,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend."
35920,L236625,u1094,m72,ENID,Is this one any good?
35921,L236624,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
35922,L236623,u1094,m72,ENID,"Sure, I guess."
35923,L236622,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
35924,L236621,u1094,m72,ENID,"Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records..."
35925,L236620,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
35926,L236619,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect ""foreign."""
35927,L236618,u1094,m72,ENID,"You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music."
35928,L236617,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Indian records?
35929,L236616,u1094,m72,ENID,Do you have any old Indian records?
35930,L236790,u1097,m72,JOE,Right.
35931,L236789,u1095,m72,GERROLD,"Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!"
35932,L236788,u1097,m72,JOE,Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
35933,L236787,u1095,m72,GERROLD,Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
35934,L236786,u1097,m72,JOE,They're Seymour's.
35935,L236785,u1095,m72,GERROLD,So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
35936,L237493,u1097,m72,JOE,No problem.
35937,L237492,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up."
35938,L237491,u1097,m72,JOE,Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
35939,L237490,u1097,m72,JOE,"Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure."
35940,L237489,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
35941,L237488,u1097,m72,JOE,"Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?"
35942,L237487,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time."
35943,L237486,u1097,m72,JOE,"Well, here's where the fun never stops!"
35944,L237570,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Call me sometime.
35945,L237569,u1100,m72,JOSH,Yeah.
35946,L237568,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
35947,L236563,u1106,m72,REBECCA,I wish I could see him.
35948,L236562,u1100,m72,JOSH,I agree.
35949,L236529,u1100,m72,JOSH,He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
35950,L236528,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?"
35951,L236525,u1100,m72,JOSH,"Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse."
35952,L236524,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Please Josh?
35953,L236964,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!"
35954,L236963,u1103,m72,MARGARET,"Right, exactly!"
35955,L236962,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,This shocking image of repressed femininity!
35956,L236961,u1103,m72,MARGARET,"I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like..."
35957,L236960,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?"
35958,L236959,u1103,m72,MARGARET,"It's a ""found object""... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art."
35959,L236958,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?"
35960,L236957,u1103,m72,MARGARET,It's a tampon in a teacup...
35961,L236956,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"What do we have here, Margaret?"
35962,L236753,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier."
35963,L236752,u1103,m72,MARGARET,It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
35964,L236751,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,Talk to us about it...
35965,L236750,u1103,m72,MARGARET,I am.
35966,L236749,u1107,m72,ROBERTA,"I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?"
35967,L237535,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
35968,L237534,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological..."
35969,L237533,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What are you talking about?
35970,L237532,u1106,m72,REBECCA,On that pathetic fake blind date.
35971,L237531,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,What do you mean?
35972,L237530,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you."
35973,L237529,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Did she say that?
35974,L237528,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"Yeah, she thinks you're a dork."
35975,L237527,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
35976,L237526,u1106,m72,REBECCA,That slut!
35977,L237525,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Really, I don't know enough about it to..."
35978,L237524,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
35979,L237523,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I have no idea - I just want to...
35980,L237522,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
35981,L237521,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
35982,L237520,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Why? What did she tell you?
35983,L237519,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,I don't know.
35984,L237518,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
35985,L237517,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Maybe she's with Josh?
35986,L237516,u1106,m72,REBECCA,"I don't know... where is she, then?"
35987,L237515,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Why would she be hiding from me?
35988,L237514,u1106,m72,REBECCA,Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
35989,L237513,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her."
35990,L237512,u1106,m72,REBECCA,What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
35991,L237511,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,No... they said she was here...
35992,L237510,u1106,m72,REBECCA,She's not at home?
35993,L237509,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
35994,L237552,u1109,m72,THERAPIST,Do you have a check for me?
35995,L237551,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,Yes?
35996,L237550,u1109,m72,THERAPIST,Seymour?
35997,L237549,u1109,m72,THERAPIST,Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
35998,L237548,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Thank you, doctor."
35999,L237547,u1109,m72,THERAPIST,Why don't we start with that next week?
36000,L237546,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage..."
36001,L237545,u1109,m72,THERAPIST,Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
36002,L237544,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it."
36003,L237543,u1109,m72,THERAPIST,So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
36004,L237542,u1108,m72,SEYMOUR,"I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit."
36005,L237795,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"-careful, Abdullah-"
36006,L237794,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
36007,L237793,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
36008,L237792,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
36009,L237791,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
36010,L237790,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
36011,L237744,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,As are they all.
36012,L237743,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Morning, friend, glorious day."
36013,L237732,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee-"
36014,L237731,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,"He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about."
36015,L237730,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all."
36016,L237729,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
36017,L237728,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
36018,L237727,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-"
36019,L237700,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights.
36020,L237699,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,There is no reason for fear.
36021,L237698,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,"Oh, you're a doctor now, too?"
36022,L237697,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Let me see the sick.
36023,L237696,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
36024,L237695,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,You were contracted to work-
36025,L237817,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night."
36026,L237816,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,How; we don't know where they are?
36027,L237815,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"Starting now, we attack them."
36028,L237804,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,I think it's been a pleasure.
36029,L237803,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
36030,L237802,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
36031,L237801,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Am I to take it you want to live?
36032,L237800,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,I am a man of peace.
36033,L237799,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
36034,L237798,u1111,m73,ABDULLAH,You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
36035,L237797,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"No hints, Samuel."
36036,L237913,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"-not a time for modesty, Bob-"
36037,L237912,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"Understand, I had help-"
36038,L237779,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told you you'd hate me."
36039,L237778,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead."
36040,L237777,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
36041,L237776,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?"
36042,L237775,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer."
36043,L237774,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?"
36044,L237773,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.
36045,L237772,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,What?
36046,L237771,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound."
36047,L237770,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,And it worked?
36048,L237769,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
36049,L237768,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?"
36050,L237767,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him."
36051,L237766,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
36052,L237765,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"I'm calling it my ""contraption""- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door."
36053,L237764,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
36054,L237759,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed?
36055,L237758,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,It hasn't been that simple so far.
36056,L237757,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?"
36057,L237756,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
36058,L237749,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"Well, I need to speak to him."
36059,L237748,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Yes he is.
36060,L237747,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
36061,L237746,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Starling?
36062,L237745,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,I do need to see Starling.
36063,L237739,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"But overall, you're pleased?"
36064,L237738,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa."
36065,L237737,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,So work must be going well?
36066,L237736,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Don't they, though?"
36067,L237735,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,Lovely sound- they seem happy.
36068,L237734,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,How could it be? I hate Africa.
36069,L237733,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Pleasant journey?
36070,L237583,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
36071,L237582,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you."
36072,L237581,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
36073,L237580,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"You'll need your confidence, I promise you."
36074,L237579,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,But I have in India- every country presents problems.
36075,L237578,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,You've never built in Africa.
36076,L237577,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
36077,L237576,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
36078,L237574,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me."
36079,L237573,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"My wife is the game player in the family, sir."
36080,L237572,u1112,m73,BEAUMONT,"John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?"
36081,L237846,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,Then why do it?
36082,L237845,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"You don't enjoy killing, do you?"
36083,L237844,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited.
36084,L237646,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight."
36085,L237645,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
36086,L237641,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,"Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift."
36087,L237640,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Then why do you stay?
36088,L237639,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,"This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer."
36089,L237691,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,"You intend ""sorting this out"" tonight?"
36090,L237690,u1119,m73,STARLING,-please- you needn't be so graphic-
36091,L237689,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,"-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-"
36092,L237644,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,"Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off."
36093,L237643,u1119,m73,STARLING,A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
36094,L237636,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,Nigel and I don't like each other much.
36095,L237635,u1119,m73,STARLING,You never had it.
36096,L237634,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,"I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, ""don't get sick in front of it.""  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack."
36097,L237823,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Then we agree.
36098,L237822,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
36099,L237821,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now."
36100,L237820,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
36101,L237819,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know."
36102,L237818,u1113,m73,HAWTHORNE,That's a terrible idea-
36103,L237594,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
36104,L237593,u1114,m73,HELENA,"Go, now.  Such a gentleman."
36105,L237592,u1114,m73,HELENA,"-not ""what if""- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our ""son"" and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit."
36106,L237591,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,What if there are complications?-
36107,L237590,u1114,m73,HELENA,"-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life."
36108,L237589,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-"
36109,L237588,u1114,m73,HELENA,Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
36110,L237587,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
36111,L237586,u1114,m73,HELENA,"Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?"
36112,L237585,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena."
36113,L237584,u1114,m73,HELENA,"I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone."
36114,L237788,u1115,m73,MIDDLE COOLIE,I assure you we came close many times-
36115,L237787,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-"
36116,L237786,u1115,m73,MIDDLE COOLIE,-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
36117,L237785,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
36118,L237784,u1115,m73,MIDDLE COOLIE,That is correct.  Nothing.
36119,L237783,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear."
36120,L237782,u1115,m73,MIDDLE COOLIE,We have hunted since childhood.
36121,L237781,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Very good indeed.
36122,L237711,u1119,m73,STARLING,"We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?"
36123,L237710,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,You mean nobody died?
36124,L237709,u1119,m73,STARLING,What a good week.
36125,L237703,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
36126,L237702,u1119,m73,STARLING,-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
36127,L237701,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Second death? Where?-
36128,L237694,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,That's what the books say...
36129,L237693,u1119,m73,STARLING,But you said they were always old.
36130,L237692,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
36131,L237684,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands-"
36132,L237683,u1119,m73,STARLING,"John, it will not be easy."
36133,L237682,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks."
36134,L237681,u1119,m73,STARLING,"You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -""there."""
36135,L237680,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,All right- thee second embankment will go there.
36136,L237676,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Possibly.
36137,L237675,u1119,m73,STARLING,Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
36138,L237674,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,How lucky we are.
36139,L237673,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,-true enough- but without the comedy relief.
36140,L237672,u1119,m73,STARLING,With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
36141,L237667,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,So that's what a lion looks like.
36142,L237666,u1119,m73,STARLING,...one shot...
36143,L237665,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one."
36144,L237664,u1119,m73,STARLING,"Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?"
36145,L237663,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,What?
36146,L237662,u1119,m73,STARLING,"John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-"
36147,L237660,u1119,m73,STARLING,That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent.
36148,L237659,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel."
36149,L237658,u1119,m73,STARLING,"I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-"
36150,L237657,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Shhh.
36151,L237656,u1119,m73,STARLING,"I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now."
36152,L237655,u1119,m73,STARLING,"Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed!"
36153,L237654,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
36154,L237653,u1119,m73,STARLING,I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
36155,L237652,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Might be exciting for you.
36156,L237651,u1119,m73,STARLING,I don't suppose I could watch.
36157,L237650,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up."
36158,L237649,u1119,m73,STARLING,"You said ""of course"" you'd need the donkey. Why ""of course""?"
36159,L237648,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl."
36160,L237647,u1119,m73,STARLING,"I couldn't believe it when you said ""sort it out."" As if it were the most normal thing in the world. ""Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."""
36161,L237633,u1119,m73,STARLING,"Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain."
36162,L237632,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?"
36163,L237631,u1119,m73,STARLING,Finish your tour?
36164,L237618,u1119,m73,STARLING,I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done.
36165,L237617,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Excellent. Could I see the bridge site?
36166,L237613,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Does he speak English?
36167,L237612,u1119,m73,STARLING,Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
36168,L237611,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Have you got that in writing?
36169,L237610,u1119,m73,STARLING,"We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me."
36170,L237609,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
36171,L237608,u1119,m73,STARLING,"Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls."
36172,L237607,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life.
36173,L237606,u1119,m73,STARLING,I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
36174,L237605,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
36175,L237604,u1119,m73,STARLING,Anything special about them?
36176,L237603,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
36177,L237602,u1119,m73,STARLING,Don't much like them.
36178,L237598,u1119,m73,STARLING,"That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking."
36179,L237597,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"He just gave me his ""monster"" speech."
36180,L237596,u1119,m73,STARLING,"Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that."
36181,L237920,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came."
36182,L237919,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
36183,L237918,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came."
36184,L237908,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
36185,L237907,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,How many do you think they've killed?
36186,L237906,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Because I think they're after you.
36187,L237905,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Why?
36188,L237904,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Good luck.
36189,L237903,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,You think they'll come then?  Why?
36190,L237902,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
36191,L237901,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Was that supposed to make me feel better?
36192,L237900,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
36193,L237899,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I'll have to.
36194,L237898,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
36195,L237897,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I'll be bait alone?
36196,L237896,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night."
36197,L237895,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight."
36198,L237892,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Don't they have to be?...
36199,L237891,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,"Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?"
36200,L237888,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
36201,L237887,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
36202,L237885,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,I got big.
36203,L237884,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,What happened to them?
36204,L237883,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed."
36205,L237882,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn...
36206,L237881,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,"It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and..."
36207,L237879,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
36208,L237878,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,But of course yours worked.
36209,L237877,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
36210,L237876,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
36211,L237875,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Goddammit!
36212,L237874,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Only in life...
36213,L237873,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,Have you ever failed?
36214,L237872,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Think about something else.
36215,L237865,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,...don't know...
36216,L237864,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Has it ever done that before?
36217,L237863,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,...misfire... it jammed...
36218,L237858,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you.
36219,L237857,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
36220,L237856,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,Samuel says you killed a lion.
36221,L237855,u1116,m73,PATTERSON,I can try.
36222,L237854,u1117,m73,REDBEARD,The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
